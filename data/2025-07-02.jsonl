Experimental\nevaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates\nTalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering\ntasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS\nTextract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that\nthe Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management\napplications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic\nanalysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,\n(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,\n(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as\nend-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks\nshowing substantial improvements across multiple categories."}

Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a\nnotable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets.

Traditionally,\nsegmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting\ntheir ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced\nmodels can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater\nflexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained\nattention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based\non user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated\nwork on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,\nespecially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,\ngenerating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from\nmultiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,\nspecifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we\nintroduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple\norgans and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage\nfeature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for\nbetter spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.\nCompared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,\nour model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest\nX-rays based on user prompts."}

However, extending these models to longer\nvideos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal\nconsistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively\napplying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable\nquality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where\nhigh-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,\nan issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose\nFreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency\ndistribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong\nachieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic\nsemantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted\nfrom short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,\nFreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture\nwith multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.\nBy arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables\nmulti-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both\nsemantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video\nsequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into\nexisting video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer\nvideos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video\ngeneration tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length).

To this end, we leverage a\nchess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's\noutput move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our\nexperiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform\nsparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below\nexpert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and\nfind evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained\nmodels' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be\nable to fully overcome."}

KUL-KT adapts the\nprinciple of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by\nintroducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that\nenables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target\n(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning\nwithout backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast\nHebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative\nupdate, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through\ngradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural\nforgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.\nOperating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured\n(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT\noutperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive\nmetrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT\npersonalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved\nlearner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05).

Targeting\nuncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,\nwe delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named\nVPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12\ndistortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where\nstate-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle\nwith basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level\nvisual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language\nbackbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that\nmay instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity.

As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to\nunderstand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to\nindividual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a\nutilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits\nfor the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.\nHowever, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their\nutilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from\nheightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced\nnorm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface\nbehavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying\ndrivers differ.

We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to\naddress these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient\nLarge Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach\nthat simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports\nand radiology classification.

Empirical\nevaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy\nconsumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the\nhybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and\nreduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy\nAppliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and\nInceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps\ninto domain-specific narratives (e.g., \"Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds\nsuggests myocardial ischemia\"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L\n(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and\nspatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical\noutputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for\ntransparent, time-aware decision-making."}

While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget.

We integrate\nthe Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and\ninstitutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in\nresponse to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national\nboundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global\nsocio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by\ngovernance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate\ncompliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability.\nDrawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent\nproperty of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies\nincluding internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network\nengagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption\nin the accounting domain."}

Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and\nanomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic\nmanagement. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly\ndetection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and\nfrequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term\ndependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain\nmodeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using\nFourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion\nlayer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to\ndetect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and\nCAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream\nmodels in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an\nimprovement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex\ntraffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that\nMamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time\nscales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and\ntraffic management.

The purpose of \\emph{partial label learning}\n(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels\nassociated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of\ndiffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their\npotential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.\nTherefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the\nperspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively\nrefining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model\nto learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the\ngeneration uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label\nfor classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch\nbetween instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a \\emph{diffusion disambiguation model\nfor PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information\nbetween instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial\ndiffusion training.

Our method\nintroduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing\ntemperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,\nenabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and\ncapturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity\nand computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the\nmodel's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently\ntransferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism\nusing a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16\nencoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean\nIoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical\ndescriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and\nreal microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path\nerrors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the\nfirst adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,\noffering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design."}

Our evaluation\nreveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an\nout-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge\nassociations. This positions LLMs as \"research hypothesis mines\", capable of\nfacilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses\nat scale with minimal human intervention."}

In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar\nformulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling\nefficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers\nfrom a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax\nAttention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based\non the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,\nLinear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.\nThis prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the\nQuery scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax\nAttention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score\ndistribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear\nAttention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully\nincorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an\nattention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while\nexhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of\nMALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,\ninstance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,\nspeech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on\nall of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA"}

The MMMR comprises 1) a\nhigh-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types\nwith symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace\nEvaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy\nthrough metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations.\nEmpirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking\ncounterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro\nsuffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This\nbenchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and\nprovides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development.\nOverall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and\nimproving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems."}

Scientific reasoning\ndemands internal representations that support simulation of actions and\nresponse, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and\ncontinuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific\ndiscovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in\ncausal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic\nplanners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge\ngraphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes\ncausal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while\nstrengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations\nthrough closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and\nautomated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides\naction and empirical surprise reshapes understanding.

Towards competitive search relevance for inference-free sparse\nretrievers, we argue that they deserve dedicated training methods other than\nusing same ones with siamese encoders. In this paper, we propose two different\napproaches for performance improvement. First, we propose an IDF-aware penalty\nfor the matching function that suppresses the contribution of low-IDF tokens\nand increases the model's focus on informative terms. Moreover, we propose a\nheterogeneous ensemble knowledge distillation framework that combines siamese\ndense and sparse retrievers to generate supervisory signals during the\npre-training phase. The ensemble framework of dense and sparse retriever\ncapitalizes on their strengths respectively, providing a strong upper bound for\nknowledge distillation.

To address this gap,\nwe introduce the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), a novel benchmark that transforms\nthe classic 8-tile puzzle into a visual RL task with images drawn from\narbitrarily large datasets. SPGym's key innovation lies in its ability to\nprecisely control representation learning complexity through adjustable grid\nsizes and image pools, while maintaining fixed environment dynamics,\nobservation, and action spaces. This design enables researchers to isolate and\nscale the visual representation challenge independently of other learning\ncomponents. Through extensive experiments with model-free and model-based RL\nalgorithms, we uncover fundamental limitations in current methods' ability to\nhandle visual diversity. As we increase the pool of possible images, all\nalgorithms exhibit in- and out-of-distribution performance degradation, with\nsophisticated representation learning techniques often underperforming simpler\napproaches like data augmentation. These findings highlight critical gaps in\nvisual representation learning for RL and establish SPGym as a valuable tool\nfor driving progress in robust, generalizable decision-making systems."}

We\nfirst confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular\nfamilies of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis,\ntheoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the\nineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer\nNormalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer\nLLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which\nundesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an\nidentity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve\nthis training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the\nvariance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of\nits depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of\ndeeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of\nmodel sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently\noutperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM\npre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to\nsupervised fine-tuning.

Modeling interactions as Poisson\nprocesses, our method proceeds in two steps: (1) estimating a low-dimensional\nsubspace of node behavior, and (2) deriving a set of novel empirical affinity\ncoefficients that quantify change in interaction intensity between latent\nfactors and support statistical testing for structural change across time\nscales. We provide theoretical guarantees for subspace estimation and the\nasymptotic behavior of the affinity coefficients, enabling model-based change\ndetection. Experiments on synthetic networks show that ANIE adapts to the\nappropriate time resolution and is able to capture sharp structural changes\nwhile remaining robust to noise. Furthermore, applications to real-world data\nshowcase the practical benefits of ANIE's multiresolution approach to detecting\nstructural change over fixed resolution methods."}

They are devoted to\nlearning the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural\nnetwork-based conditional density estimators. As a SNPE technique, the\nautomatic posterior transformation (APT) method proposed by Greenberg et al.\n(2019) performs notably and scales to high dimensional data.

HYH and MM contributed equally", "summary": "Learning the unknown interactions that govern a quantum system is crucial for\nquantum information processing, device benchmarking, and quantum sensing. The\nproblem, known as Hamiltonian learning, is well understood under the assumption\nthat interactions are local, but this assumption may not hold for arbitrary\nHamiltonians. Previous methods all require high-order inverse polynomial\ndependency with precision, unable to surpass the standard quantum limit and\nreach the gold standard Heisenberg-limited scaling. Whether Heisenberg-limited\nHamiltonian learning is possible without prior assumptions about the\ninteraction structures, a challenge we term \\emph{ansatz-free Hamiltonian\nlearning}, remains an open question. In this work, we present a quantum\nalgorithm to learn arbitrary sparse Hamiltonians without any structure\nconstraints using only black-box queries of the system's real-time evolution\nand minimal digital controls to attain Heisenberg-limited scaling in estimation\nerror. Our method is also resilient to state-preparation-and-measurement\nerrors, enhancing its practical feasibility. We numerically demonstrate our\nansatz-free protocol for learning physical Hamiltonians and validating analog\nquantum simulations, benchmarking our performance against the state-of-the-art\nHeisenberg-limited learning approach. Moreover, we establish a fundamental\ntrade-off between total evolution time and quantum control on learning\narbitrary interactions, revealing the intrinsic interplay between\ncontrollability and total evolution time complexity for any learning algorithm.\nThese results pave the way for further exploration into Heisenberg-limited\nHamiltonian learning in complex quantum systems under minimal assumptions,\npotentially enabling new benchmarking and verification protocols."}

While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion\nmodels offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning,\nthey often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent\ndiffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically\nrealizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their\nsteerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight:\nmodeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion\nmodel makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted\nstates. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques\nfrom kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions.\nAs a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level\nplanner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream\ntasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle\navoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control.

LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural\nnetwork (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein\nconformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,\nsequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent\nrepresentations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by\ndihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates.
