However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects.

First, a novel QoE\nmetric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual\nsensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.\nThe QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming\n(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational\nresources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By\nleveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by\nvarious actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal\ninference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments\nconducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework\nsignificantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains\nfairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods."}

Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises\nwhen these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for\nwhich ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.\nProviding recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under\nMM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,\nthe CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity.

However, due to\nthe substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the\nperformance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the\nregistration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized\nimages in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight\nSpectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features\nfrom the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,\nthe obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered\nHSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are\nemployed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we\npropose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity\nregularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This\napproach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces\ncomputational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization\n(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.\nFinally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are\nconducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance."}

However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,\naccepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat\nenables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random\nzigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and\nbackward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the\ngenerated outputs.

We tackle this problem by\nintroducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to\nsuccessfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant\ndesign of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM\ncomponents-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the\nrolling forecast setting.

However,\nexisting work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code\nwritten for government applications. In particular, government enterprise\nsoftware is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language\ncode (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context\nwindow size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are\nprimarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited\ntesting with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy\nlanguages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines\nthe application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written\nin ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We\ninvestigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary\nmodule comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking\nmethods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including\nGPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs\ncan select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We\nalso find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks\nsuch as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that\nare up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create\npartitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable\nreplacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided\nmodernization."}

We demonstrate significant improvements\nin F1 scores across seven popular benchmarks, including Named Entity\nRecognition (NER) tasks such as Conll2003, Wnut2017 , and the Chinese\nnamed-entity recognition task Weibo, as well as End-to-End Aspect-Based\nSentiment Analysis (E2E-ABSA) benchmarks such as Laptop14, Restaurant14,\nRestaurant15, and Restaurant16. With out any extra strategy, we achieve third\nhighest score on weibo NER benchmark.

Recent\napproaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of\nlarge language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation\nmodels. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,\nwhich restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.\nMeanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in\nviewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present\nVideo Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework\nthat exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in\nvideo generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object\nplacements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and\nseamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and\nopen-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze\neach object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism\nand structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce\nFirst-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,\nutilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning\nability of multimodal large language models.

HRIBench covers five key\ndomains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction\nunderstanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social\nnavigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected\ndata from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue\nunderstanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four\ndomains.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific\ntokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to\naddress the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to\ncreate a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for\nparticipants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation\nlearning process."}

Traditional\nideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML\nconsiderations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic\nexpectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends\nLean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data\nSource Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical\nconstraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and\nvalidated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both\nstatic validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world\nindustrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with\nqualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.\n[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,\naligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional\ncollaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,\nthough some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be\nmitigated by expert facilitation.

Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel\nparadigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by\ntransmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task\nperformance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining\ntask accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a\ndiffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes\nsemantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with\nself-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance.

We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description\nand message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on\ndebug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to\nlocalize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit\ntests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in\nassisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of\nsoftware artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts,\nDEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy\nmethods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0\ndataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods.\nFurthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to\nother state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on\nSWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code\ncan be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,\nmaterial science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.\nHowever, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily\ncostly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large\noptimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical\ncharacterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication\nprocesses. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has\nprovided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including\nsurrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for\nnoisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for\nfabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery.

However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a\nspecific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of\ndefense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are\ncurrent backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse\npractical defenses?\n  To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on\ninput-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative\ndefenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks\ndesigned to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by\nexamining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying\ncauses behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of\nbackdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and\nfeature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter\nspace, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking\ncomprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack\ncalled Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective\nmodule, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the\nparameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against\nstate-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset\nof ImageNet.

ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms\nrace within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the \"Red\nAgent,\" is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,\nphysically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while\nevading detection.

We first formalize the current\ndesk-rejection policies as an optimization problem, and then develop a\npractical algorithm based on linear programming relaxation and a rounding\nscheme. Under extensive evaluation on 11 years of real-world ICLR\n(International Conference on Learning Representations) data, our method\npreserves up to $19.23\\%$ more papers without violating any author limits.\nMoreover, our algorithm is highly efficient in practice, with all results on\nICLR data computed within at most 53.64 seconds.

Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent\nwill exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is\nintroduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the\ngradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding\nbackdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth\nand enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static\nvisual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We\nevaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM\narchitectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves\nhigh attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high\nclean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation\nstudies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and\nconcealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical\nsecurity flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to\nclean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense\nmechanisms in their training pipelines."}

Under Review", "summary": "We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to\nperform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human\ndemonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

Current interpretability work can extract features\nfrom hidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how\nMLP weights construct features. One challenge is that element-wise\nnonlinearities introduce higher-order interactions and make it difficult to\ntrace computations through the MLP layer. In this paper, we analyze bilinear\nMLPs, a type of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity\nthat nevertheless achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully\nexpressed in terms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing\nflexible analysis of the weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights\nusing eigendecomposition reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy\ntasks, image classification, and language modeling.

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks.

However, with typical random ansatz or quantum alternating\noperator ansatz, derived variational quantum algorithms become a black box that\ncannot be trusted for model interpretation, not to mention deploying as\napplications in informing critical decisions: the results of these variational\nparameters are just rotational angles for the quantum gates and have nothing to\ndo with interpretable values that a model can provide directly. In this paper,\nwe construct the first interpretable quantum regression algorithm, in which the\nquantum state exactly encodes the classical data table and the variational\nparameters correspond directly to the regression coefficients, which are real\nnumbers by construction, providing a high degree of model interpretability and\nminimal cost to optimize due to the right expressiveness. We also take\nadvantage of the encoded data structure to reduce the time complexity of\ncomputing the regression map. To shorten the circuit depth for nonlinear\nregression, our algorithm can be extended by building nonlinear features by\nclassical preprocessing as the independent encoded column vectors.

This is known as a neural network Gaussian process (NNGP).\nHowever, the NNGP kernel is fixed and tunable only through a small number of\nhyperparameters, thus eliminating the possibility of representation learning.\nThis contrasts with finite-width NNs, which are often believed to perform well\nbecause they are able to flexibly learn representations for the task at hand.\nThus, in simplifying NNs to make them theoretically tractable, NNGPs may\neliminate precisely what makes them work well (representation learning). This\nmotivated us to understand whether representation learning is necessary in a\nrange of graph tasks. We develop a precise tool for this task, the graph\nconvolutional deep kernel machine. This is very similar to an NNGP, in that it\nis an infinite width limit and uses kernels, but comes with a ``knob'' to\ncontrol the amount of flexibility and hence representation learning.

Our\nconstrained learning framework solves for the best plug-in estimator under the\nconstraint that the first-order error with respect to the plugged-in quantity\nis zero, and can leverage flexible model classes including neural networks and\ntree ensembles.

In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary\nlearning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The\nproposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is\ndistinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior\ndistribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in\nthe model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may\nbe placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the\nmodel space rather than in parameter space.

Models such as o1 display a more even\ntrade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and\nORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding\nof models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a\nprivate set for evaluation."}

Leveraging programmable hardware\narchitectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically\nadapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,\nincluding joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either\ndemonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through\ngradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques\nrooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review\narchitectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured\nstate-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence\nmodels effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we\nexplore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing\nboth theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that\nICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver\nadaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without\nrequiring online retraining."}

One is based on a\nre-normalized Wald test, which is shown to be consistent as long as the number\nof distributed data blocks $K$ is of a smaller order of the minimum block\nsample size and the level of heterogeneity is dense. The second one is an\nextreme contrast test (ECT) based on the difference between the largest and\nsmallest component-wise estimated parameters among data blocks. By introducing\na sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising\nfrom the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much\nlarger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT\nprocedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the\nWald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power\nunder varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct\nintensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER)\nand the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to\npresent the implementation and validity of the proposed methods."}

Rooted in rough path\ntheory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for\nmodelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling -\ncommon challenges in real-world time series and graph data.\n  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path\nsignatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of\nmodels that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency,\nbridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and\nkernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature\nkernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling;\nthe Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight\nspace for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based\nmodels where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion\nprocesses, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph\nneural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature\nFeatures, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and\nRecurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian\nprocesses, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting\nmechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context\nlength.\n  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual\nbridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in\nscalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data."}
