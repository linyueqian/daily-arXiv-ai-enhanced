We propose Partial State Causal\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By\nleveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by\nvarious actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal\ninference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments\nconducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework\nsignificantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains\nfairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods."}

Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises\nwhen these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for\nwhich ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.\nProviding recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under\nMM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,\nthe CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to\nresolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is\nparametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the\nspecification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further\ncustomisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different\nargumentation semantics.

To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight\nSpectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features\nfrom the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,\nthe obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered\nHSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are\nemployed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we\npropose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity\nregularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This\napproach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces\ncomputational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization\n(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.\nFinally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are\nconducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance."}

However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau.

Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods\noften introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size\nand computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance\nand autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,\nand abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly\neffective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a\nYOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single\ntarget frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal\nmodifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational\nefficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the\nchallenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method\nimproves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively\nnarrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks.

Counterfactual\nself-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the\nmodel's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in\nthe training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be\naffected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in\nparticular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization\ntreating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into\naccount how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a\nsmall language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training\nsamples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking\nat self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with\nmemorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces\nself-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable.

In this work, we present\nVideo Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework\nthat exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in\nvideo generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object\nplacements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and\nseamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and\nopen-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze\neach object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism\nand structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce\nFirst-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,\nutilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning\nability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that\nVIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across\ndiverse scenarios. The code will be released."}

First, we demonstrate that we can\nchange the concept without changing the language and vice versa through\nactivation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean\nrepresentation of a concept across different languages does not affect the\nmodels' ability to translate it, but instead improves it.

To construct HRIBench, we collected\ndata from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue\nunderstanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four\ndomains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of\n1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of\nboth state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.\nOur results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still\nstruggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of\nthe models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory\nperformance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring\nthe need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with\nimproved human perception capabilities. HRIBench and our results can be found\nin this Github repository: https://github.com/interaction-lab/HRIBench."}

For\nupdates on diseases with frequency information in HPO (n=5), the $R^2$ for\nRecall@8 change was 0.831 ($p$=0.031), and for Precision@8 change, it was 0.78\n($p$=0.047), indicating the method can predict post-deployment performance.

Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel\nparadigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by\ntransmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task\nperformance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining\ntask accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a\ndiffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes\nsemantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with\nself-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our\nmodel also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion\nto ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio\nenvironments.

We propose the MiLAAP\nattention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,\nspatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a\nself-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS\npattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel\noccupancy state within that region.

PDD is an iterative, five-step\nprocess that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters,\nii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs\nfrom simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device\nperformance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,\nmaterial science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.\nHowever, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily\ncostly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large\noptimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical\ncharacterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication\nprocesses. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has\nprovided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including\nsurrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for\nnoisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for\nfabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this\nreview, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable\nmachine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with\npowerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under\nnoisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review\nwill provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into\nthis emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the\ndevelopment of complex photonic devices and systems."}

We present three complementary attribution\nmethods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the\nmodel generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box\nmethod of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which\nidentified \"broadcasting\" sentences that receive disproportionate attention\nfrom all future sentences via \"receiver\" attention heads; (3) a causal\nattribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by\nsuppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each\nfuture sentence's tokens.

However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a\nspecific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of\ndefense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are\ncurrent backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse\npractical defenses?\n  To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on\ninput-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative\ndefenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks\ndesigned to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by\nexamining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying\ncauses behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of\nbackdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and\nfeature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter\nspace, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking\ncomprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack\ncalled Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective\nmodule, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the\nparameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against\nstate-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset\nof ImageNet.

ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms\nrace within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the \"Red\nAgent,\" is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,\nphysically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while\nevading detection.

This\ndataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics\n(SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in\nsix traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring,\nand depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green)\namong demographics and personalities.

Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves\nzero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task\ninnovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains:\n5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly\ndetection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series\nretrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters\n(10-100X smaller than existing SOTA models) and allow GPU-free inference,\nsetting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models.

Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks.

Some existing\nrecommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling\nvarious types of interactive relations between users and items in real-world\nrecommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on\nonline shopping platforms. Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with\ntwo significant challenges: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the\nimpact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users\nand items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different\nrelations within behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system\nscenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel recommendation framework,\nDual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the\naforementioned challenges. It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern\nrepresentation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex\nuser-item interactive relations, and includes a relation chain representation\nlearner and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various\nauxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different\nrelations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DCMGNN\nsurpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary\nlearning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The\nproposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is\ndistinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior\ndistribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in\nthe model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may\nbe placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the\nmodel space rather than in parameter space.

By introducing\na sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising\nfrom the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much\nlarger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT\nprocedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the\nWald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power\nunder varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct\nintensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER)\nand the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to\npresent the implementation and validity of the proposed methods."}

Rooted in rough path\ntheory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for\nmodelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling -\ncommon challenges in real-world time series and graph data.\n  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path\nsignatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of\nmodels that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency,\nbridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and\nkernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature\nkernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling;\nthe Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight\nspace for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based\nmodels where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion\nprocesses, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph\nneural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature\nFeatures, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and\nRecurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian\nprocesses, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting\nmechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context\nlength.\n  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual\nbridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in\nscalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data."}
