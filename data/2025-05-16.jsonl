To address this limitation, we propose $\\textit{Diversity-aware Reward\nAdjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity\ninto the reward computation.

Our approach\nenables state-of-the-art models $\\unicode{x2013}$ including\nPhi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\\unicode{x2013}$ to retain\nperformance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the\npresence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show\nthat as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can\nbe quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show\nthat our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better\nscaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input\nquantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient\nanalog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.\nCode is available at https://github.com/IBM/analog-foundation-models ."}

This process is time-consuming\nand prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in\nhealthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)\noffers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from\nelectronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast\ncancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on\npublic health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of\ncancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and\nefficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels\nat identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into\nstandardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and\nclassifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,\nincluding negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In\nthis work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity\nRecognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical\ninformation from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health\nResearch Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast\ncancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities\nmanually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the\nbsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained\nin Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,\nenabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types.

While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that\nstructured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling\nrapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how\ndeep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models."}

Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such\nas jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music\ngeneration tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based\narchitecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations\nthrough a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The\nimprovisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to\none or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original\ncomposition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple\ncapabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre\nimprovisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute\nshort prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation\nframework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural\nsimilarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations\ndemonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent\nimprovisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original\npieces.

Conversely, AR methods employ an autoregressive paradigm to\npredict the compressed speech token by implicitly modeling duration with Markov\nproperties. Although this approach improves prosody, it does not provide the\nstructural guarantees necessary for stability. To simultaneously address the\nissues of stability and naturalness in speech generation, we propose\nFlexSpeech, a stable, controllable, and expressive TTS model. The motivation\nbehind FlexSpeech is to incorporate Markov dependencies and preference\noptimization directly on the duration predictor to boost its naturalness while\nmaintaining explicit modeling of the phonetic units to ensure stability.\nSpecifically, we decompose the speech generation task into two components: an\nAR duration predictor and a NAR acoustic model. The acoustic model is trained\non a substantial amount of data to learn to render audio more stably, given\nreference audio prosody and phone durations. The duration predictor is\noptimized in a lightweight manner for different stylistic variations, thereby\nenabling rapid style transfer while maintaining a decoupled relationship with\nthe specified speaker timbre.

Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on\nentropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing\nmodel stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation\nmechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers\nwith those of the source model.

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability.

Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

To solve this problem, BINGO is\nintroduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a\nneural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight\nplays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,\nBINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for\ninsignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an\naccuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive\nthan current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to\nmean model growth, as well."}

Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control.

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

Second, we\ninclude training configurations that explicitly break $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry,\nreinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms,\nacting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in\nthe absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions\nthrough comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and\npercolation thresholds.\n  Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient\ntraining schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in\ncomplex systems.

Subsequently, the autonomous\npart of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman\neigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using\nmetaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based\neigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against\nan in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear\nfeedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the\neigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled\nproportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control\napproach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the\noptimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results\nshowed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark\ncontrollers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under\nsea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature."}

Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further\nverifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then\ninserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the\nimportance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of\ncounterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity\nmeasures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated\nGradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of\ndemonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a\nstrong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and\nthe quality of generated counterfactuals."}

However, it faces several\nchallenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture\nview-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and\nspecular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for\ncolor representation often struggle to effectively capture anisotropic\ncomponents, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex\nlighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color\nsaturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a\nperceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes,\nincluding opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical\nharmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which\nenables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects.

Rather than using a safety\ncertifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe\ncontroller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe\ncontrollers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this\napproach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a\nhigh-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic\ninterventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by\ndeciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly\nefficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing\nover a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To\nlearn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers\nare learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system\nis first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The\neffect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the\nclosed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such\nthat the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is\nminimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data\nrequirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to\nintegrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation\ntechnique is introduced.

In the former regime, we\nshow that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with\nincreasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir\niterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with\nquantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates\ngeneralization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast,\nthe memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both\nreservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove\nexponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving\nthese results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding\nconcentration in temporal quantum learning models."}

However, these\nnetworks may become vulnerable to new security threats. Therefore, 6G/NextG\nnetworks must be equipped with advanced Artificial Intelligence algorithms, in\norder to evade these attacks. Existing studies on the intrusion detection task\nrely on the train of shallow machine learning classifiers, including Logistic\nRegression, Decision Trees, and so on, yielding suboptimal performance. Others\nare based on deep neural networks consisting of static components, which are\nnot conditional on the input. This limits their representation power and\nefficiency. To resolve these issues, we present the first study integrating\nMixture of Experts (MoE) for identifying malicious traffic. Specifically, we\nuse network traffic data and convert the 1D array of features into a 2D matrix.\nNext, we pass this matrix through convolutional neural network (CNN) layers\nfollowed by batch normalization and max pooling layers. After obtaining the\nrepresentation vector via the CNN layers, a sparsely gated MoE layer is used.\nThis layer consists of a set of experts (dense layers) and a router, where the\nrouter assigns weights to the output of each expert. Sparsity is achieved by\nchoosing the most relevant experts of the total ones. Finally, we perform a\nseries of ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodel.

Sequential\ndecision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable\nsuccess - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari\nand Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs.\nDespite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models\nthat can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations,\nparticularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model\nclass is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems.\nThese challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and\nadaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees\nprovide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent\nperformance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another\nkey challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial\nrequirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings.\nTo address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient,\nrobust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making\nalgorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits.

Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively\nexpensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when\nlearning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is\nlabour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR\n(Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be\ntrained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our\nmethod is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two\nloss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward\nincreases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss\nthat discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform\nexperiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and\nMimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot\nquadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling\nmodel-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward\nlearning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from\nvideos of people and of other robots performing a task. Website:\nhttps://gcr-robot.github.io/."}

Recent studies relax the smoothness assumption by\nallowing the Lipschitz constant of the gradient to grow with respect to the\ngradient norm, which accommodates a broad range of objectives in practice.\nDespite this progress, existing generalizations of smoothness are restricted to\nEuclidean geometry with $\\ell_2$-norm and only have theoretical guarantees for\noptimization in the Euclidean space. In this paper, we address this limitation\nby introducing a new $\\ell*$-smoothness concept that measures the norm of\nHessians in terms of a general norm and its dual, and establish convergence for\nmirror-descent-type algorithms, matching the rates under the classic\nsmoothness. Notably, we propose a generalized self-bounding property that\nfacilitates bounding the gradients via controlling suboptimality gaps, serving\nas a principal component for convergence analysis. Beyond deterministic\noptimization, we establish an anytime convergence for stochastic mirror descent\nbased on a new bounded noise condition that encompasses the widely adopted\nbounded or affine noise assumptions."}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space\nmodel (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional,\nnon-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single\nshared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive\nimplicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition\ndynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of\nthe implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly\napproximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network\nparameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational\nparameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble\nKalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and\nefficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in\nsystem dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series\nforecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in\nterms of computational efficiency and accuracy."}
