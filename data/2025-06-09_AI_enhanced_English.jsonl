Notably, VR-INR also\nperforms zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy\ndata during training. Our method employs a hierarchical\nspatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution\nimplicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and\nnoise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired\nmagnification.

Despite the promising\nresults, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future\ntrajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history\ntransitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders\nthe discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to\ncritical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we\nintroduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework\nfor offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any\nintermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task\ninto two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating\nforward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating\nbackward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can\nefficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially\nvaluable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating\ndataset diversity.

The analyzed\nresults are then utilized to drive state transitions, enabling closed-loop\nfeedback control. To demonstrate its capabilities, we applied the agents to\ncalibrate and operate a superconducting quantum processor, where they\nautonomously planned and executed experiments for hours, successfully producing\nand characterizing entangled quantum states at the level achieved by human\nscientists.

However, separate training of visual and textual encoders\noften results in a misalignment of the modality.

These inaccuracies severely undermine the\ntrustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to\noptimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation\nindicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically,\nthese models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is\nheavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the\nmodel focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object\nreferenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the\nmodalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images.

However, the prevalent black-box Application\nProgramming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant\nchallenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting,\nwhich aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic\nfeatures of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in\nthis area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for\nefficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual\nfingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel\nfingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract\ndeep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our\nanalysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from\nthe same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between\ndifferent LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective\nfor LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset\ndemonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than\nthe strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly\nreleased models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models.\nNotably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks,\nincluding polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental\nresults show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2%\n(LM-D) to 23.9%.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces FD-Dataset and FDLLM for LLM fingerprinting, addressing challenges in accountability and security by leveraging LoRA adaptation for robust model identification.", "motivation": "The black-box API access to LLMs poses accountability, governance, and security challenges, necessitating effective fingerprinting methods.", "method": "FDLLM uses LoRA to fine-tune a foundation model, extracting deep features for LLM identification, and is evaluated on the FD-Dataset.", "result": "FDLLM outperforms baselines with a 22.1% higher Macro F1 score, generalizes well (95% accuracy on unseen models), and is robust against adversarial attacks.", "conclusion": "FDLLM is a superior and robust solution for LLM fingerprinting, addressing current limitations and adversarial threats."}}

While these methods are\nknown to achieve better dimensional dependence than stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) for stochastic convex optimization under favorable geometry, the\ntheoretical justification for their success in stochastic non-convex\noptimization remains elusive. In fact, under standard assumptions of Lipschitz\ngradients and bounded noise variance, it is known that SGD is worst-case\noptimal in terms of finding a near-stationary point with respect to the\n$l_2$-norm, making further improvements impossible.

While existing methods rely on\nspecialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle\nto learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle\nmissing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose\nPhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis\nthat models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal\nsignals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility\nwith arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal\ntokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and\nmodality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete\nmodality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning\nwith prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four\ndownstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor\nprediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing\nmodalities.

Similarly, Neural Delay Differential\nEquations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of\nDensely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to\ntraditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that\nallow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections\nintroduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern\narchitectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs\ninfluences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying\nthe memory capacity is the product $K \\tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the\ndelay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network\nwidth is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and\nclassical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation\nproperty. We show that if the memory capacity $K\\tau$ is sufficiently small,\nthe dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.\nConsequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack\nthe universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity\n$K\\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation\nproperty of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE\narchitecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which\nuniversal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by\nincreasing the memory capacity $K\\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of\nDDEs with positive delay $\\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump\ntransition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory\nthreshold, universal approximation holds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neural DDEs' memory capacity (K\u03c4) influences universal approximation.
