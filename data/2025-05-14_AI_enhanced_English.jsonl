While limited benchmarks have touched upon specific aspects like\nprotocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks:\nProtocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol\nGeneration, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on\nprocedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields\nnearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream\nopen/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while\ntop models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly\nwith deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and\ngeneration. Furthermore, model comparisons reveal diverse performance: certain\nopen-source models approach closed-source levels on some tasks, yet\nbio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on\ncomplex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural\nreasoning within biological protocols represents a significant challenge for\ncurrent LLMs. BioProBench serves as a standardized framework to diagnose these\nspecific limitations and guide the development of AI systems better equipped\nfor safely automating complex scientific procedures.

Our\npublicly-available dataset contains smartwatch inertial data from ten\nparticipants, with manually annotated start and end times of each bite along\nwith their corresponding weights from a smart scale, under semi-controlled\nconditions. The proposed method combines extracted behavioral features such as\nthe time required to load the utensil with food, with statistical features of\ninertial signals, that serve as input to a Support Vector Regression model to\nestimate bite weights. Under a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme,\nour approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.99 grams per bite. To\ncontextualize this performance, we introduce the improvement metric, that\nmeasures the relative MAE difference compared to a baseline model. Our method\ndemonstrates a 17.41% improvement, while the adapted state-of-the art method\nshows a -28.89% performance against that same baseline.
