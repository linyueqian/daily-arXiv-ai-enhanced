Existing\nstate-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses\ngenerated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these\napproaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is\nconsistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with\nrespect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in\naddition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal\nmodels. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The\nconfidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall\nconfidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the\npipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric\ncalibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the\naccuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across\nmultiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and\nvisual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as\nLLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework\nachieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks."}

While current GNNs perform well in\nnode classification tasks within in-distribution (ID) settings, real-world\nscenarios often present distribution shifts, leading to the presence of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) nodes. OOD detection in graphs is a crucial and\nchallenging task. Most existing research focuses on homogeneous graphs, but\nreal-world graphs are often heterogeneous, consisting of diverse node and edge\ntypes. This heterogeneity adds complexity and enriches the informational\ncontent. To the best of our knowledge, OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs\nremains an underexplored area. In this context, we propose a novel methodology\nfor OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs (OODHG) that aims to achieve two main\nobjectives: 1) detecting OOD nodes and 2) classifying all ID nodes based on the\nfirst task's results. Specifically, we learn representations for each node in\nthe heterogeneous graph, calculate energy values to determine whether nodes are\nOOD, and then classify ID nodes. To leverage the structural information of\nheterogeneous graphs, we introduce a meta-path-based energy propagation\nmechanism and an energy constraint to enhance the distinction between ID and\nOOD nodes. Extensive experimental findings substantiate the simplicity and\neffectiveness of OODHG, demonstrating its superiority over baseline models in\nOOD detection tasks and its accuracy in ID node classification."}

However, the stego image\ngenerated by existing FNNS methods suffers from considerable distortion and\nexhibits poor robustness, severely reducing the security and practicality of\nsteganography. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Robust Fixed\nNeural Network Steganography (RFNNS). In RFNNS, we introduce a texture-aware\nlocalization technique to add perturbations carrying secret image information\nto complex texture areas that are less perceptible to the human eye, thereby\nensuring the quality of the stego image.

Subsequently, the generated robust perturbations are combined with the\nAI-generated cover image to produce the stego image. The receiver only needs to\nshare the secret key and employ the same decoding network structure to\naccurately extract the secret image from the attacked stego image.

SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a\nconfigurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local\nsensory input (k x k view) and local communication. We propose metrics for\ncoordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Evaluating\nseveral leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance\nvariations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local\ninformation constraints. While some coordination emerges, results indicate\nlimitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in\nthese decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is\ncrucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems. We\nrelease SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and\nscalable physical system with defined mechanical properties. It provides\nenvironments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental\ndatasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS\ncoordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS.

This is done by introducing a novel Proximity\nAttention mechanism in an encoder-decoder architecture utilizing a Pointer\nNetwork in the decoding process (Proximity Attention Encoder and Pointer\nNetwork decoder: PAPN) to leverage the underlying connections between the\ndifferent visitable pickup positions at each timestep.

However, the sensor characteristics, proximity\nto the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often\nlimit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution\ntechniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these\ntechniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of\ndistress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images\ni.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the\npre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this\nstudy developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN)\nand efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately\nclassified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution\ntechnique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress\nobtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the\nevaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the\ncombination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the\ninfrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost\nand false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection\nshowed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of\neven minor cracks.

Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple\ndiffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model\nfails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in\nplanning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by\nlogistics environments.

Evidence from the Inverse Frequency Effect in Structural Priming", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": "This version is accepted to NAACL 2025\n  (https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.586/)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown the emergent capability of in-context\nlearning (ICL). One line of research has claimed that ICL is functionally\nequivalent to gradient descent, a type of error-driven learning mechanism. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new way of diagnosing whether ICL is functionally\nperforming error-driven learning. Our approach is based on the inverse\nfrequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an agent's behavior is\ninfluenced to a greater degree when presented with improbable examples as\ncompared to more likely ones. The IFE has previously been identified in\npsycholinguistics where humans exhibit the IFE in the context of structural\npriming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have\nencountered recently). In that context, the IFE has been used as evidence that\nhuman structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms. In our\nexperiments, we simulated structural priming with ICL and found that LLMs\nindeed display the IFE, with the effect being stronger in larger models. We\nconclude that at least in the case we studied, ICL is indeed a type of\nerror-driven learning, supporting the hypothesis that an error signal is\nimplicitly computed in the forward pass during ICL. Our results suggest that\nboth humans and LLMs make use of error-driven processing mechanisms in on-line\nprocessing."}

The CTF module learns core\nexplanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal\nfactors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard\ntensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss\noptimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt\nrepresentations for better classification performance. To strengthen this\ncontrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but\ninformative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the\noriginal data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by\ndynamically sampling a \"soft\" class prototype to guide the warping of each\nquery data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently\npattern-mixed between the \"soft\" class prototype and the query sample.

Exploiting this\ninsight, we propose a novel dehazing framework, WDMamba, which decomposes the\nimage dehazing task into two sequential stages: low-frequency restoration\nfollowed by detail enhancement. This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to\neffectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process,\nresulting in high-quality restored images. Specifically, in the low-frequency\nrestoration stage, we integrate Mamba blocks to reconstruct global structures\nwith linear complexity, efficiently removing overall haze and producing a\ncoarse restored image. Thereafter, the detail enhancement stage reinstates\nfine-grained information that may have been overlooked during the previous\nphase, culminating in the final dehazed output. Furthermore, to enhance detail\nretention and achieve more natural dehazing, we introduce a self-guided\ncontrastive regularization during network training. By utilizing the coarse\nrestored output as a hard negative example, our model learns more\ndiscriminative representations, substantially boosting the overall dehazing\nperformance.

Basic forecasting provides no guarantee for these desired structural\nrelationships. Reconciliation addresses this problem, which is crucial for\norganizations requiring coherent predictions across multiple aggregation\nlevels. Current methods like minimum trace (MinT) are mostly limited to tree\nstructures and are computationally expensive. We introduce FlowRec, which\nreformulates hierarchical forecast reconciliation as a network flow\noptimization, enabling forecasting on generalized network structures. While\nreconciliation under the $\\ell_0$ norm is NP-hard, we prove polynomial-time\nsolvability for all $\\ell_{p > 0}$ norms and , for any strictly convex and\ncontinuously differentiable loss function. For sparse networks, FlowRec\nachieves $O(n^2\\log n)$ complexity, significantly improving upon MinT's\n$O(n^3)$. Furthermore, we prove that FlowRec extends MinT to handle general\nnetworks, replacing MinT's error-covariance estimation step with direct network\nstructural information. A key novelty of our approach is its handling of\ndynamic scenarios: while traditional methods recompute both base forecasts and\nreconciliation, FlowRec provides efficient localised updates with optimality\nguarantees. Monotonicity ensures that when forecasts improve incrementally, the\ninitial reconciliation remains optimal. We also establish efficient,\nerror-bounded approximate reconciliation, enabling fast updates in\ntime-critical applications. Experiments on both simulated and real benchmarks\ndemonstrate that FlowRec improves accuracy, runtime by 3-40x and memory usage\nby 5-7x.

Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can\naccurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to\nconsider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities.

We frame the problem as a\nroofline classification task: given the source code of a GPU kernel and the\nhardware specifications of a target GPU, can an LLM predict whether the GPU\nkernel is compute-bound or bandwidth-bound?\n  For this study, we build a balanced dataset of 340 GPU kernels, obtained from\nHeCBench benchmark and written in CUDA and OpenMP, along with their\nground-truth labels obtained via empirical GPU profiling. We evaluate LLMs\nacross four scenarios: (1) with access to profiling data of the kernel source,\n(2) zero-shot with source code only, (3) few-shot with code and label pairs,\nand (4) fine-tuned on a small custom dataset.\n  Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs have a strong understanding of\nthe Roofline model, achieving 100% classification accuracy when provided with\nexplicit profiling data.

Moreover, they offer limited control\nover the inserted person's pose. To address these challenges, we propose two\nmethods. Both allow explicit pose control via a 3D body model and leverage\nlatent diffusion models to synthesize the person at a contextually appropriate\ndepth, naturally handling occlusions without requiring occlusion masks. The\nfirst is a two-stage approach: the model first learns a depth map of the scene\nwith the person through supervised learning, and then synthesizes the person\naccordingly. The second method learns occlusion implicitly and synthesizes the\nperson directly from input data without explicit depth supervision.\nQuantitative and qualitative evaluations show that both methods outperform\nexisting approaches by better preserving scene consistency while accurately\nreflecting occlusions and user-specified poses."}

To address this, we propose\nDeMuVGN, a defect prediction model that learns multi-view software dependency\nvia graph neural networks. We introduce a Multi-view Software Dependency Graph\n(MSDG) that integrates data, call, and developer dependencies. DeMuVGN also\nleverages the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address\nclass imbalance and enhance defect module identification. In a case study of\neight open-source projects across 20 versions, DeMuVGN demonstrates significant\nimprovements: i) models based on multi-view graphs improve F1 scores by 11.1%\nto 12.1% over single-view models; ii) DeMuVGN improves F1 scores by 17.4% to\n45.8% in within-project contexts and by 17.9% to 41.0% in cross-project\ncontexts. Additionally, DeMuVGN excels in software evolution, showing more\nimprovement in later-stage software versions. Its strong performance across\ndifferent projects highlights its generalizability. We recommend future\nresearch focus on multi-view dependency graphs for defect prediction in both\nmature and newly developed projects."}

While\ntransformer-based domain adaptation methods better capture distant\nrelationships through self-attention mechanisms that facilitate more effective\ncross-domain feature alignment, their quadratic computational complexity makes\npractical deployment challenging for object detection tasks across diverse\ndomains. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of\nthe Mamba architecture, we present the first domain-adaptive Mamba-based\none-stage object detection model, termed DA-Mamba. Specifically, we combine\nMamba's efficient state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to address\ndomain-specific spatial and channel-wise variations. Our design leverages\ndomain-adaptive spatial and channel-wise scanning within the Mamba block to\nextract highly transferable representations for efficient sequential\nprocessing, while cross-attention modules generate long-range, mixed-domain\nspatial features to enable robust soft alignment across domains. Besides,\nmotivated by the observation that hybrid architectures introduce feature noise\nin domain adaptation tasks, we propose an entropy-based knowledge distillation\nframework with margin ReLU, which adaptively refines multi-level\nrepresentations by suppressing irrelevant activations and aligning uncertainty\nacross source and target domains. Finally, to prevent overfitting caused by the\nmixed-up features generated through cross-attention mechanisms, we propose\nentropy-driven gating attention with random perturbations that simultaneously\nrefine target features and enhance model generalization."}

To address this gap, we introduce\nVCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with\nexplicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six\ncognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to\nensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH,\nrevealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable\nto exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in\nvisual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLM\nadvancements.The project can be found at\nhttps://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/VCBench/."}

We also prove that for any representation mapping, the\nHSCL and Hard-UCL (HUCL) losses are lower bounded by the corresponding SCL and\nUCL losses. In contrast to existing literature, our theoretical results for SCL\ndo not require class-conditional independence of augmented views and work for a\ngeneral loss function class that includes the widely used InfoNCE loss\nfunction. Moreover, our proofs are simpler, compact, and transparent. Similar\nto existing literature, our theoretical claims also hold for the practical\nscenario where batching is used for optimization. We empirically demonstrate,\nfor the first time, that Adam optimization (with batching) of HSCL and HUCL\nlosses with random initialization and suitable hardness levels can indeed\nconverge to the NC-geometry if we incorporate unit-ball or unit-sphere feature\nnormalization. Without incorporating hard-negatives or feature normalization,\nhowever, the representations learned via Adam suffer from Dimensional-Collapse\n(DC) and fail to attain the NC-geometry. These results exemplify the role of\nhard-negative sampling in contrastive representation learning and we conclude\nwith several open theoretical problems for future work.

However, limited-capacity accelerators\nrequire hybrid analog/digital algorithms to solve real-world problems, commonly\nusing large-neighborhood local search (LNLS) frameworks. Unlike fully digital\nalgorithms, hybrid LNLS has no non-asymptotic convergence guarantees and no\nprincipled hyperparameter selection schemes, particularly limiting cross-device\ntraining and inference.\n  In this work, we provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for hybrid\nLNLS by reducing to block Langevin Diffusion (BLD) algorithms. Adapting tools\nfrom classical sampling theory, we prove exponential KL-divergence convergence\nfor randomized and cyclic block selection strategies using ideal DXs. With\nfinite device variation, we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein bias\nin terms of step duration, noise strength, and function parameters. Our BLD\nmodel provides a key link between established theory and novel computing\nplatforms, and our theoretical results provide a closed-form expression linking\ndevice variation, algorithm hyperparameters, and performance."}

The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced\nautomated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new\ntask alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse\nmulti-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset.\nEvaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler\ncharacteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods,\nmost of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans.\nHowever, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be\nreaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The\nED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional\nmetrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores,\nhighlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with\nhigh-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but\nmost methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements\nbased solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting\nreliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis\nidentified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model\ngeneralization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial\nrole. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site,\nhad smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a\ncomprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in\nfetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved\ntopological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically\nrobust and generalizable AI tools."}

In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process\ninherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without\nrequiring external representation components. We therefore propose\nSelf-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that\nobtain representation guidance through a self-distillation manner.\nSpecifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion\ntransformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with\nlower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during\nonly generative training process.

A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times.\nThe transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag.

For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day\ncollectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to\ndevelop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the\nbag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we\nutilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the\nDAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the\nobserved history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across\nbags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process\n(MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm\nbased on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle\nperiodic MDPs.

While recent supervised VQA models\nhave made substantial progress, the reliance on manually annotated datasets --\na process that is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to scale up -- has\nhindered further optimization of their generalization to unseen video content\nand distortions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a self-supervised learning\nframework for VQA to learn quality assessment capabilities from large-scale,\nunlabeled web videos. Our approach leverages a \\textbf{learning-to-rank}\nparadigm to train a large multimodal model (LMM) on video pairs automatically\nlabeled via two manners, including quality pseudo-labeling by existing VQA\nmodels and relative quality ranking based on synthetic distortion simulations.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel \\textbf{iterative self-improvement training\nstrategy}, where the trained model acts an improved annotator to iteratively\nrefine the annotation quality of training data. By training on a dataset\n$10\\times$ larger than the existing VQA benchmarks, our model: (1) achieves\nzero-shot performance on in-domain VQA benchmarks that matches or surpasses\nsupervised models; (2) demonstrates superior out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization across diverse video content and distortions; and (3) sets a new\nstate-of-the-art when fine-tuned on human-labeled datasets.

Neuron-adaptive techniques, which selectively activate\nneurons in Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, offer some speedups but suffer\nfrom limitations in modern Transformers. These include reliance on sparse\nactivations, incompatibility with attention layers, and the use of costly\nneuron masking techniques. To address these issues, we propose the Adaptive\nRank Allocation framework and introduce the Rank and Neuron Allocator (RaNA)\nadapter. RaNA adapters leverage rank adapters, which operate on linear layers\nby applying both low-rank matrix decompositions and adaptive masking to\nefficiently allocate compute without depending on activation sparsity. This\nenables RaNA to be generally applied to MLPs and linear components of attention\nmodules, while eliminating the need for expensive maskers found in\nneuron-adaptive methods. Notably, when compared to neuron adapters, RaNA\nimproves perplexity by up to 7 points and increases accuracy by up to 8\npercentage-points when reducing FLOPs by $\\sim$44% in state-of-the-art\nTransformer architectures. These results position RaNA as a robust solution for\nimproving inference efficiency in modern Transformer architectures."}

The results show that the\nRDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different\nseasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by\nclustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption\ntime series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics."}

Previous work proposed\nthe inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical\nbath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with\nphysics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges\nin scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural\nnetworks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an\nefficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the\n\\textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled\nbath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature\nspace provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the\npresence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the\ninput space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this\ncase), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the\nbroad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how\ncontrol pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space."}

Networks,\nrepresented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper\nextends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted\ngraphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit\nheterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG\nmodel that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products\nof these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights'\ndistribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior\nart, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the\nsame mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical\nguarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the\nworkhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and\nasymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables\nsampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG,\nfacilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using\njudicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the\nmodel's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its\nguarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all\ncomplemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's\neffectiveness in various network analytic applications."}

However, in conventional approaches, prediction\nmodels were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model\nenables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by\ncombining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional\nneural networks (GCN) with features such as molecular descriptors and additive\ninformation. The predictive performance of the proposed method is empirically\nevaluated using several polymer datasets. We report that the proposed method\nshows high predictive performance compared to the baseline conventional\napproach using a single feature."}
