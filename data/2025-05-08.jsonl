Existing\nstate-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses\ngenerated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these\napproaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is\nconsistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with\nrespect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in\naddition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal\nmodels. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The\nconfidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall\nconfidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the\npipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric\ncalibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the\naccuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across\nmultiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and\nvisual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as\nLLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework\nachieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks."}

While current GNNs perform well in\nnode classification tasks within in-distribution (ID) settings, real-world\nscenarios often present distribution shifts, leading to the presence of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) nodes. OOD detection in graphs is a crucial and\nchallenging task. Most existing research focuses on homogeneous graphs, but\nreal-world graphs are often heterogeneous, consisting of diverse node and edge\ntypes. This heterogeneity adds complexity and enriches the informational\ncontent. To the best of our knowledge, OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs\nremains an underexplored area. In this context, we propose a novel methodology\nfor OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs (OODHG) that aims to achieve two main\nobjectives: 1) detecting OOD nodes and 2) classifying all ID nodes based on the\nfirst task's results. Specifically, we learn representations for each node in\nthe heterogeneous graph, calculate energy values to determine whether nodes are\nOOD, and then classify ID nodes. To leverage the structural information of\nheterogeneous graphs, we introduce a meta-path-based energy propagation\nmechanism and an energy constraint to enhance the distinction between ID and\nOOD nodes. Extensive experimental findings substantiate the simplicity and\neffectiveness of OODHG, demonstrating its superiority over baseline models in\nOOD detection tasks and its accuracy in ID node classification."}

However, the stego image\ngenerated by existing FNNS methods suffers from considerable distortion and\nexhibits poor robustness, severely reducing the security and practicality of\nsteganography. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Robust Fixed\nNeural Network Steganography (RFNNS). In RFNNS, we introduce a texture-aware\nlocalization technique to add perturbations carrying secret image information\nto complex texture areas that are less perceptible to the human eye, thereby\nensuring the quality of the stego image.

Subsequently, the generated robust perturbations are combined with the\nAI-generated cover image to produce the stego image. The receiver only needs to\nshare the secret key and employ the same decoding network structure to\naccurately extract the secret image from the attacked stego image.

To bridge this\ngap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically\nevaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized\nagents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a\nconfigurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local\nsensory input (k x k view) and local communication. We propose metrics for\ncoordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Evaluating\nseveral leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance\nvariations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local\ninformation constraints. While some coordination emerges, results indicate\nlimitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in\nthese decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is\ncrucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems. We\nrelease SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and\nscalable physical system with defined mechanical properties. It provides\nenvironments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental\ndatasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS\ncoordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS.

This is done by introducing a novel Proximity\nAttention mechanism in an encoder-decoder architecture utilizing a Pointer\nNetwork in the decoding process (Proximity Attention Encoder and Pointer\nNetwork decoder: PAPN) to leverage the underlying connections between the\ndifferent visitable pickup positions at each timestep. To this local attention\nprocess is coupled global context computing via a multi-head attention\ntransformer encoder.

Although real-time\nvision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual\nunderstanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness\nin assisting visually impaired individuals. In this work, we conduct the first\nsuch evaluation. First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily),\ncovering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals:\nBasic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks. The results show that\nGPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. Next, we conduct a user study to\nevaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further\nexploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts.\nOne key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving\npotential hazards in dynamic environments.

We find that\nstory-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success\nrates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent.

The effectiveness of such conversations has been\nlinked not only to the exchange of clinical information, but also to a range of\ninterpersonal behaviors; commonly referred to as social signals, which are\noften conveyed through non-verbal cues and shape the quality of the\npatient-provider relationship. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated an increasing ability to infer emotional and social behaviors\neven when analyzing only textual information. As automation increases also in\nclinical settings, such as for transcription of patient-provider conversations,\nthere is growing potential for LLMs to automatically analyze and extract social\nbehaviors from these interactions.

FoodTrack estimates food\nvolume directly, without relying on intake gestures or fixed assumptions about\nbite size, offering a more accurate and adaptable solution for tracking food\nconsumption.

We identify two key\nchallenges: modality discrepancy, where existing large touch-language models\noften treat touch as a mere sub-modality of language, and open-ended tactile\ndata scarcity, where current datasets lack the diversity, open-endness and\ncomplexity needed for reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nSToLa, a Self-Adaptive Touch-Language framework. SToLa utilizes Mixture of\nExperts (MoE) to dynamically process, unify, and manage tactile and language\nmodalities, capturing their unique characteristics. Crucially, we also present\na comprehensive tactile commonsense reasoning dataset and benchmark featuring\nfree-form questions and responses, 8 physical properties, 4 interactive\ncharacteristics, and diverse commonsense knowledge.

Our approach is based on the inverse\nfrequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an agent's behavior is\ninfluenced to a greater degree when presented with improbable examples as\ncompared to more likely ones. The IFE has previously been identified in\npsycholinguistics where humans exhibit the IFE in the context of structural\npriming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have\nencountered recently). In that context, the IFE has been used as evidence that\nhuman structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms.

This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to\neffectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process,\nresulting in high-quality restored images.

Basic forecasting provides no guarantee for these desired structural\nrelationships. Reconciliation addresses this problem, which is crucial for\norganizations requiring coherent predictions across multiple aggregation\nlevels. Current methods like minimum trace (MinT) are mostly limited to tree\nstructures and are computationally expensive. We introduce FlowRec, which\nreformulates hierarchical forecast reconciliation as a network flow\noptimization, enabling forecasting on generalized network structures. While\nreconciliation under the $\\ell_0$ norm is NP-hard, we prove polynomial-time\nsolvability for all $\\ell_{p > 0}$ norms and , for any strictly convex and\ncontinuously differentiable loss function. For sparse networks, FlowRec\nachieves $O(n^2\\log n)$ complexity, significantly improving upon MinT's\n$O(n^3)$. Furthermore, we prove that FlowRec extends MinT to handle general\nnetworks, replacing MinT's error-covariance estimation step with direct network\nstructural information. A key novelty of our approach is its handling of\ndynamic scenarios: while traditional methods recompute both base forecasts and\nreconciliation, FlowRec provides efficient localised updates with optimality\nguarantees. Monotonicity ensures that when forecasts improve incrementally, the\ninitial reconciliation remains optimal. We also establish efficient,\nerror-bounded approximate reconciliation, enabling fast updates in\ntime-critical applications.

To alleviate this issue, we\npropose a novel Features Matrix (FM) regularization approach designed to\nenhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and\nleverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the\nFM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective,\npreserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of\noverfitting. Representative evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the FM is\ncompatible with existing frameworks as a generic and flexible module, and 2)\nthe FM significantly showcases its effectiveness in enhancing target-unspecific\ntasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

In\nthis work, we describe the application of this method to the context of Connect\nFour, in order to study its performance in a different setting, which can lead\nto a better generalization of the technique. We also kept track of a metric\nthat wasn't taken into account in previous work: the average number of\niterations to obtain a flagged action. Since going second is a significant\ndisadvantage in Connect Four, we also had the intent of exploring how this more\ncomplex scenario would impact the performance of our approach. The experiments\ninvolved training and testing classical and quantum RL agents that played\neither going first or going second against a Randomized Negamax opponent. The\nresults showed that both flagged exploration policies were clearly superior to\na simple epsilon-greedy policy. Furthermore, the quantum agents did in fact\nsample flagged actions in less iterations.

These equations play a central role in both plasma physics and\ncosmology. Due to the complexity of the potential involved, analytical\nsolutions are rarely available, necessitating the use of numerical methods such\nas Particle-In-Cell. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on\nHamiltonian-informed Normalizing Flows, specifically a variant of Fixed-Kinetic\nNeural Hamiltonian Flows. Our method transforms an initial Gaussian\ndistribution in phase space into the final distribution using a sequence of\ninvertible, volume-preserving transformations derived from Hamiltonian\ndynamics. The model is trained on a dataset comprising initial and final states\nat a fixed time T, generated via numerical simulations.

The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder\nto extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman\nsubspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the\nMori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields an approximate\nclosure of the dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear\nautoencoder, thereby enhancing the accuracy and stability of the Koopman\noperator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's improved\npredictive capability for flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low\ndimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) with promising\nshort-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By\nbridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical\nfoundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved\nunderstanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics."}

We also prove that for any representation mapping, the\nHSCL and Hard-UCL (HUCL) losses are lower bounded by the corresponding SCL and\nUCL losses. In contrast to existing literature, our theoretical results for SCL\ndo not require class-conditional independence of augmented views and work for a\ngeneral loss function class that includes the widely used InfoNCE loss\nfunction. Moreover, our proofs are simpler, compact, and transparent. Similar\nto existing literature, our theoretical claims also hold for the practical\nscenario where batching is used for optimization. We empirically demonstrate,\nfor the first time, that Adam optimization (with batching) of HSCL and HUCL\nlosses with random initialization and suitable hardness levels can indeed\nconverge to the NC-geometry if we incorporate unit-ball or unit-sphere feature\nnormalization. Without incorporating hard-negatives or feature normalization,\nhowever, the representations learned via Adam suffer from Dimensional-Collapse\n(DC) and fail to attain the NC-geometry.

These systems introduce\nnew attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of\nplanning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during\nexecution.\n  In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as\nwell as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and\ndemonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate\nattacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new\nsecure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security\nguarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples\nplanning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using\nonly trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan\nusing installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system\nsatisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis\non the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and\ncapability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted\naccording to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system\nis secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark\nfor control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks,\nand our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant\nadvancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of\nvarying levels of trustworthiness."}

It is used in applications\nsuch as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several\ntime series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four\ndecades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or\nassociation dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new\ndissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC),\nwhich combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest\nelement-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity.\nIt is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated\nand compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the\nRDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different\nseasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by\nclustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption\ntime series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics."}

Previous work proposed\nthe inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical\nbath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with\nphysics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges\nin scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural\nnetworks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an\nefficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the\n\\textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled\nbath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature\nspace provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the\npresence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the\ninput space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this\ncase), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the\nbroad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how\ncontrol pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space."}

Networks,\nrepresented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper\nextends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted\ngraphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit\nheterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG\nmodel that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products\nof these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights'\ndistribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior\nart, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the\nsame mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical\nguarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the\nworkhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and\nasymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables\nsampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG,\nfacilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using\njudicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the\nmodel's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its\nguarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all\ncomplemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's\neffectiveness in various network analytic applications."}

However, in conventional approaches, prediction\nmodels were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model\nenables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by\ncombining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional\nneural networks (GCN) with features such as molecular descriptors and additive\ninformation.
