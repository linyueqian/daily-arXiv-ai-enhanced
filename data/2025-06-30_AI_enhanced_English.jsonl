To integrate the advances from\nfederated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework,\nFederated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT\nmodels with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner\nwithout losing estimation accuracy.\n  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy\nsimilar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering\ncritical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We\nalso validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends\nIRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,\nwithout sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we\nprovide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the\ntwo-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).", "AI": {"tldr": "FedIRT combines IRT with federated learning for privacy-preserving, distributed ability and item calibration without accuracy loss.", "motivation": "Traditional IRT requires centralized data, raising privacy concerns.

RCO uses a feedback loop where\ncritiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its\nresponses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these\nrefinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By\nfocusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need\nfor direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving\nmeaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,\ndialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,\nand code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional\nmethods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement\noutcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel\nsupervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive\nexperimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM\ncritique-refinement loops.", "AI": {"tldr": "RCO is a framework to train critic models using refinement signals, improving LLM critique-refinement loops by focusing on effective critiques.", "motivation": "Limited research exists on effective critiques for improving LLM responses or generating them.", "method": "RCO uses a feedback loop where critiques guide refinements, with critique utility (CU) as a reward signal.", "result": "RCO outperforms traditional methods in critique quality and refinement across five tasks.", "conclusion": "RCO enhances LLM critique-refinement loops without direct critique preference assessment."}}

These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight\nprimary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual\ndecrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming\nincreasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a\nsignificant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months\nof 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a\nnotable change in readability during 2023 and 2024.

Our system,\nwhich combines convolutional layers with autoregressive Transformers, processes\nan entire music score page and outputs a complete transcription in a music\nencoding format. This is made possible by both the architecture and the\ntraining procedure, which utilizes curriculum learning through incremental\nsynthetic data generation. We evaluate the proposed system using pianoform\ncorpora, which is one of the most complex sources in the OMR literature. This\nevaluation is conducted first in a controlled scenario with synthetic data, and\nsubsequently against two real-world corpora of varying conditions. Our approach\nis compared with leading commercial OMR software.

The\nemergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement,\noffering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by\nleveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a\ncomprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives:\nBayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the\nfundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model\ndesign and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also\nrevisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical\nrelevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future\nresearch.", "AI": {"tldr": "A survey reviewing temporal point processes (TPPs) from Bayesian, deep learning, and large language model (LLM) perspectives, covering fundamentals, model design, applications, and future directions.", "motivation": "To explore the evolution of TPPs from traditional statistical methods to modern neural and LLM-based approaches, highlighting their flexibility and practical relevance.", "method": "Review of TPP fundamentals, model design, and parameter estimation techniques across Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM frameworks, along with classic applications.", "result": "Comprehensive insights into TPP advancements, showcasing the potential of neural and LLM-based methods for complex temporal dynamics.", "conclusion": "TPPs continue to evolve with deep learning and LLMs, offering new opportunities and challenges for future research in event sequence modeling."}}

By analyzing\npatterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human\nactions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall\ndetection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where\neven minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This\nsensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when\napplying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To\naddress this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for\ncross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global\ndistributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its\npopularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to\nmisalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is\nachieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum\nMean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless\nsensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the\ntarget domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains\nwithin each category using MMD.

Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view\nthat PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance\nusing an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still\nstruggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g.,\nmathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the\nperformance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data\nutilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the\nMLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses\nimage condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO\ntraining. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves\ndata utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying\ndifficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating\nthe token prediction logits with image condition in test-time.

In these regimes, multiple users will reside in the\nradiative near-field, and accurate localization becomes essential. Unlike\nconventional far-field systems that rely solely on DOA estimation, near-field\nlocalization exploits spherical wavefront propagation to recover both DOA and\nrange information. While subspace-based methods, such as MUSIC and its\nextensions, offer high resolution and interpretability for near-field\nlocalization, their performance is significantly impacted by model assumptions,\nincluding non-coherent sources, well-calibrated arrays, and a sufficient number\nof snapshots. To address these limitations, this work proposes AI-aided\nsubspace methods for near-field localization that enhance robustness to\nreal-world challenges. Specifically, we introduce NF-SubspaceNet, a deep\nlearning-augmented 2D MUSIC algorithm that learns a surrogate covariance matrix\nto improve localization under challenging conditions, and DCD-MUSIC, a cascaded\nAI-aided approach that decouples angle and range estimation to reduce\ncomputational complexity. We further develop a novel model-order-aware training\nmethod to accurately estimate the number of sources, that is combined with\ncasting of near field subspace methods as AI models for learning.
