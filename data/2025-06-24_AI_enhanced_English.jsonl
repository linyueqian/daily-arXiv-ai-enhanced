We present MISO, a\nvision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil\nmaps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a\ngeospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural\nrepresentations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for\nmultimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random\nForest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping\napplications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost\nZones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better\nto remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is\ncritical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.\nThese findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for\nfine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling\nand infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes.

The accuracy of the group's final decision can be\nsignificantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few\ninfluential agents.\n  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess\nuncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.\nAssume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple\nnon-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the\nFrench-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this\niterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic\nestimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate\ndetermined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every\nagent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state\nof the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights\nallocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents\nmust then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined\nby the available sets of influence weights.

By\nleveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization\nability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,\nintroduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses\ncontextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central\naction of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by\ntraining it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We\nvalidate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on\nEPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement\nin cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the\nmodel achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action\nrecognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes SeqDG, a domain generalization method for Egocentric Action Recognition, improving cross-domain performance by leveraging action sequences and visual-text reconstruction.", "motivation": "Addresses performance drop in Egocentric Action Recognition models in unseen environments due to variability in illumination, viewpoint, and environment.", "method": "Introduces SeqDG with SeqRec (visual-text sequence reconstruction) and SeqMix (training on mixed action sequences from different domains).", "result": "Achieves +2.4% improvement on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and +0.6% Top-1 accuracy on EGTEA over SOTA.", "conclusion": "SeqDG enhances generalization in unseen environments by leveraging action sequences and contextual cues."}}

Through selectively\nreplacing semantic topics within VLM responses with model's own resampled\ncandidates for targeted rewriting, TPR can provide topic-level control over\nfine-grained semantic details. This precise control enables advanced data\ncuration strategies, such as progressively adjusting the difficulty of rejected\nresponses, thereby sculpting an effective reward gap configuration that guides\nthe model to overcome challenging hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate TPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple hallucination\nbenchmarks, outperforming previous methods by an average of 20%.

These\nmeasurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full\n6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive\ncontroller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.\nTo ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online\nfrom a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling\nreal-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate\nNOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest\ntrails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss\nand severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each\nexperiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess\nresilience, showing consistent and reliable performance.

In the SFT stage, we focus on improving\ninstruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and\nhigh-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data\nconstruction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the\nRL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking\nreward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward\nto further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on\nMMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable\nresults to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the\nbest retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results\nvalidate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

Instead of\nenumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract\npolicies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort\nare saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative\noptimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost\ndescent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization\ncan be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods\nconsistently outperform the baselines in most cases.

The problem arises in various research fields, including\nmachine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad\nreal-world applications.\n  This paper presents new $\\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix\ncompletion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and\nany real number $\\varepsilon \\in [ 2^{-O(d)},\\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial\nmatrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive\nsemi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a\npositive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an\nadditive error of at most $\\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to\nexceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon ^2 \\cdot\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon)} )$.

However, these methods typically model\nthe evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear\ninterpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space.\nWe show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and\ninterconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling\nconvergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution\nof the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems\nparameterized by Markov random fields (MRF).
