Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which\nallocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However,\nspeech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result,\nmany tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences.\nTo address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for\ncompressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on\nneural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and\narchitecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and\nMelt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When\nintegrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR\n($\\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to\n46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and\nsimilar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also\nenables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a\nsingle model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently\noutperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank.

Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

These scenarios are designed\nsuch that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet\nunrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then\nevaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of\ncontextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without\nviolating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,\nincluding GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual\nprivacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\\% and 43.6\\% of the\ntime. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in\n59.9\\% and 50.5\\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.\nFurthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\\% of scenarios.\nThese results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both\ncontextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving."}

However, we argue that video depth\nestimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal\nconsistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are\nfundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically\nbackgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all\nframes, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for\ndynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to\nensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.\nBased on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth\nestimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with\nvideo depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic\nareas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth\ndiffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of\nboth.

Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,\nthis work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR."}

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling.

We hypothesize that\ndetecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution\nboundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators\ntrained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form\ndistinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD\ndetection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference,\nbatches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data\ndistribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses\nthe VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples\nto train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the\nboundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening\nthis boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD\ndetection benchmarks.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way.

Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and\nyield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance\nwith conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational\nefficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in\nunder 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond\ncomputational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates\nsophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,\nand applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant\npotential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly\ncharacterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit\napplications."}

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards.

In response, we introduce\nHalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate\nhallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual\nreasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual\ninstance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly\nintroduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually\ncoherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art\nvision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations\nare significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often\npersisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual\nreasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity."}

While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or\nhighly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of\ngrokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language\nmodel (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,\nproviding a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement\non diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely\ndependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,\nenabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and\ntest.

Then, the performance of the\nmodels, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the\ndifference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT\nslightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of\nhydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences\nand why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an\nexplainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables,\nproviding valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a\nconsiderable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible\ndata quality issues.

This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to\nretrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.\nTransformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of\ntheir ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value\narchitecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time.

Existing SF-OSDA methods typically rely on\nthresholding the prediction entropy of a sample to identify it as either a\nknown or unknown class, but fail to explicitly learn discriminative features\nfor the target-private unknown classes. We propose Recall and Refine (RRDA), a\nnovel SF-OSDA framework designed to address these limitations by explicitly\nlearning features for target-private unknown classes. RRDA employs a two-stage\nprocess. First, we enhance the model's capacity to recognize unknown classes by\ntraining a target classifier with an additional decision boundary,guided by\nsynthetic samples generated from target domain features. This enables the\nclassifier to effectively separate known and unknown classes. Second, we adapt\nthe entire model to the target domain, addressing both domain shifts and\ndistinguishability to unknown classes. Any off-the-shelf source-free domain\nadaptation method (e.g. SHOT, AaD) can be seamlessly integrated into our\nframework at this stage. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that RRDA significantly outperforms existing SF-OSDA and OSDA\nmethods."}

To fill this gap, we first examine the\ncurrent 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model\nafter removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in\nSGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard'\ndoes not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness.\nBased on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative\nModel (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects\nthe score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time\nstochastic differential equation process.

Inspired by real-world scenarios, we study a\nclassification paradigm where data symmetries are only partially observed\nduring training: some classes include all transformations of a cyclic group,\nwhile others -- only a subset. In the infinite-width limit, where kernel\nanalogies apply, we derive a neural kernel theory of symmetry learning.

Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, where the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the normative lens of rational\nanalysis, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal adaptation to\ndata given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian\nframework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next-token predictions\nthroughout training -- without assuming access to its weights. Under this\nframework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transitioning from generalization to memorization as task\ndiversity increases. Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive\naccount of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity."}

To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during\npretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and\nperform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training\nmixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this\nphenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data\ndistribution or ordering affect the features that current representation\nlearning methods can learn over time.

Its highly realistic rendering quality and real-time rendering\ncapabilities make it promising for various applications. However, when applied\nto large-scale aerial urban scenes, 3DGS methods suffer from issues such as\nexcessive memory consumption, slow training times, prolonged partitioning\nprocesses, and significant degradation in rendering quality due to the\nincreased data volume. To tackle these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{HUG}, a\nnovel approach that enhances data partitioning and reconstruction quality by\nleveraging a hierarchical neural Gaussian representation. We first propose a\nvisibility-based data partitioning method that is simple yet highly efficient,\nsignificantly outperforming existing methods in speed. Then, we introduce a\nnovel hierarchical weighted training approach, combined with other optimization\nstrategies, to substantially improve reconstruction quality. Our method\nachieves state-of-the-art results on one synthetic dataset and four real-world\ndatasets."}

It\nfollows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting\nvisual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in\nBlender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a\ncoherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative\ncompositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original\n(source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video\nframes with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible\nmodifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,\nfacilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion\nsignificantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing\ntasks."}

A Survey of Utility and Privacy of Synthetic Image Generation", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.CV"], "comment": "Accepted at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security '25).\n  21 pages, plus a 6-page appendix", "summary": "Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image\ngeneration for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field\nlacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation\nmethods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic\nimages for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of\ngeneration-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and\noutputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically\ncategorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations\nalong this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare\ndiverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative\ngenerative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs)\nas a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical\nquestions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which\nrelease strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the\nutility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different\nscenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides\nactionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data\ngeneration methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies\nfor real-world applications."}

A grasping agent\nthat both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the\nuncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act\nunder high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and\nuncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have\nconnected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method\nfor training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an\nimage-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We\ngenerate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real\nimages and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object\nvariability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects\njointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless\ncontribute to the same goal."}
