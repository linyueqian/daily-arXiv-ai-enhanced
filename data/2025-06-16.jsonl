Telecommunications\noperation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications\nindustry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,\nand human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified\nservice control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of\nOS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have\nhindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical\nfield. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications\nOperation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this\nbenchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating\nfour key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket\nhandling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To\nsystematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,\nwe categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling\ninto four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic\nNLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we\nleverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10\nopen-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)\nacross diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source\nLLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting\ntheir significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications\noperation scheduling."}

As retrieval complexity\nincreases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical.

This\nraises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect\nmultimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled\nexperiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe\na consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To\nquantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and\ndevelop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across\ndecoder layers.

Our model\nconsists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region\nfeatures across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network\nmodel, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from\nthousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to\neffectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region\nassociations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain\nnetwork for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study\ndemonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain\ndisease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain\nnetwork analysis research."}

We argue that the quantization error can be effectively\nalleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie\nwithin the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a\nplug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines\nnamed Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space\nprojection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.\nSubsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent\nvector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference\ncondition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and\nbaselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective\nof null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first\nstep to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null\nspace, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced\nquantization methods.

However, existing UDA studies are based on natural\nimages or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse\nconditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design\ncalled Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which\ndynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating\ntraining progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the\nlearning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for\nlearning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a\nunique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which\nstatistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically\nadjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This\nstrategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid\nlabels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object\ndetection under adverse scene conditions.

Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \\emph{limited}\ngeneralizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on\nunseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion\nof covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their\nperformance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.\nWhile TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream\nclassification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in\nforecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs\nforecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle\nin more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These\nfindings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,\nparticularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and\ntemporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and\nscalable solutions for BEM."}

Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the\ntraining loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final\ngeneralization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine\nstability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher\ncomplexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for\noverparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of\nneural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world\ndatasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization\ngap."}

Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes\nlarge language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language\nmodels, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of\nautonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,\nopen-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we\nexamine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and\nanalysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and\nresearch questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

However, in the context of limited and noisy data,\naccurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is\na challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.\nCurrent methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for\nreal-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the\nDelayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,\nby developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)\ntransformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state\n(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From\ndynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than\nindividual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such\nnonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a\nsingle shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical\nstates from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs\ndistinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently\npredicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical\nfoundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of\nTransformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in\nforecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of\nthese two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on\nthe lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the\ncoarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this\npaper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not\nnecessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy\nof ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different\nproperties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form\ndescription or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed\nlifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the\nreduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a\nconstrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been\nlinked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the\nimpact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened\ngraphs."}

As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To\nsupport the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that\nreflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall\nshort -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on\nless capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major\nadvancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes\nboth original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from\nten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and\nnon-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate\nten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four\nrealistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three\ncomplementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the\nstrengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges\nfor future work.

This\nphenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy\ninfluences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop\nthat can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual\ntrajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used\nin policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates\nbut also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action\nvalues relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights\nstate-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking\nspurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors.

Bridging these ideas, this study\nintroduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that\nrealises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples\nthe resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor.

To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric.

SeMo follows an effective\nthree-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the\nAbstraction step, we use a carefully designed Masked Motion Encoder, which\nleverages a self-supervised learning paradigm to compress the subject's motion\nstate into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the\nReasoning step, we efficiently generate motion sequences based on the driving\naudio signal. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as\nconditional information to guide the motion decoder in synthesizing realistic\ntransitions from reference frame to target video. Thanks to the compact and\nexpressive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method achieves efficient\nmotion representation and high-quality video generation. User studies\ndemonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win\nrate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression\ncapability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential."}

Based on this\nobservation, we propose a simple modification to DPO, H-DPO, which allows for\ncontrol over the entropy of the resulting policy, enhancing the distribution's\nsharpness and thereby enabling mode-seeking fitting more effectively. In our\nexperiments, we show that H-DPO outperformed DPO across various tasks,\ndemonstrating superior results in pass@$k$ evaluations for mathematical tasks.\nMoreover, H-DPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to\nthe loss calculation of DPO, which makes it highly practical and promising for\nwide-ranging applications in the training of LLMs."}

By curating a suite of diverse\ntest scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how\nthese models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and\nmaintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an\nextensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision\nencoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law\n(larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model\nplays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the\nperformance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color\nunderstanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning\nimproves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are\nvision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on\nColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks.

First, transformation representations\nare specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar\ntransformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations.\nSecond, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on\nRelations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity\nembeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable\nscore distributions among relations.

Most existing methods require estimating the\nunknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for\nhigh-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which\ncombines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to\nconstruct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown\nlikelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired\nlevel in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control.

Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some\ninput data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.\nYet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations\nrelies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability\ndistribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence\naccount for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have\nbeen previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its\nprobabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical\ndescriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to\nlearn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of\nfaithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this\ntask. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard\nmethods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain\nmeaningful and interpretable.

This is due to the need to: (a) reach statistical\nsteadiness by physically advecting errors in the initial field sufficiently far\ndownstream, and (b) gather a sufficient sample of fluctuating flow data to\nestimate time-averaged quantities of interest. We present a machine\nlearning-based initialization method that aims to reduce the cost of transient\nsolve by providing more accurate initial fields. Through a case study in\nautomotive aerodynamics on a 17M-cell unsteady incompressible RANS simulation,\nwe evaluate three proposed ML-based initialization strategies against existing\nmethods. Here, we demonstrate 50% reductions in time-to-convergence compared to\ntraditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Two ML-based\ninitialization strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a hybrid method\ncombining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) an approach\nintegrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD\nsolvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally-expensive\nsteady RANS initializations, while requiring far less wall-clock time to\ncompute the initialization field. Notably, these improvements are achieved\nusing an ML model trained on a different dataset of diverse automotive\ngeometries, demonstrating generalization capabilities relevant to specific\nindustrial application areas. Because this Hybrid-ML workflow only modifies the\ninputs to an existing CFD solver, rather than modifying the solver itself, it\ncan be applied to existing CFD workflows with relatively minimal changes; this\nprovides a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations using\nexisting ML surrogate models."}

Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 %\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a\nchallenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining\neffort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual\nradio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be\nfine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the\ncost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than\nexisting methods and demonstrates superior generalization."}

Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects\nlearnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow\ninto a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood\ncomputation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training\nstability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants,\nincluding Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very\nfew or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative\nlocomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual\ninput and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained\nan average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged\nlocomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared\nto state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate\nof the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved\nan average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or\neven one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM\npolicies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each\nexposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the\ndifference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the\ncommonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.\nWe introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower\nvariance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the\nestimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and\noffers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit\nsimilarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the\neffectiveness and practicality of the proposed method."}
