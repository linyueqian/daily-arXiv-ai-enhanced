This research investigates the use of\nauthorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a\nmeans to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting\ntransparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior\nwork, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and\nexpansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three\ndatasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of\nMelbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include\nLLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from\n506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology\nto construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture\nmeaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's\neffectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing\nbetween student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against\nLLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the\nenhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and\nmeasure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing\neducators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations.\nThis work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the\ndynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era."}

In this paper, we compare two\nversions of Academical, a choice-based educational interactive narrative game\nabout research ethics.

The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to\nmission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of\nreal-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting.\nApplying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges,\nsuch as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action\nspaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time\ncontrol of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these\nchallenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of\nabstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level\ncommander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission\ntargets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by\nexploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control\nfrom command tasks.

This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation\n(FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function\napproximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from\nmonitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states\nwith unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization\nwith a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally\ndefined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such\nfunction approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to\novergeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors.

QoE of YouTube\nreflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift\nevents. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is\nfrequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts\nensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion\nscore.

To address this, we\npropose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel\nframework inspired by counterfactual reasoning.

Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher\nlogits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the\ncontext prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual\nentrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the\nrelevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the\nsentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of\ncontextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual\nprompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while\ncontextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic\nfactors.\n  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment\nheads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a\nnovel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we\nidentify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,\ni.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is\nsignificantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates\nto what it would produce if no distracting context were provided.

However, established methods for\ncomputing counterfactuals typically focus on one-step decision-making, and are\nnot directly applicable to sequential decision-making tasks. This paper fills\nthis gap by introducing counterfactual strategies for Markov Decision Processes\n(MDPs). During MDP execution, a strategy decides which of the enabled actions\n(with known probabilistic effects) to execute next. Given an initial strategy\nthat reaches an undesired outcome with a probability above some limit, we\nidentify minimal changes to the initial strategy to reduce that probability\nbelow the limit. We encode such counterfactual strategies as solutions to\nnon-linear optimization problems, and further extend our encoding to synthesize\ndiverse counterfactual strategies.

Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial\nintelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the\ndiscovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction,\nand traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article\nintroduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural\nlanguage processing techniques integrated with large language models to extract\nand systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into\nstructured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes\ninformation into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application,\nstructured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data\nusability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not\nonly facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces\nreliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only\nstreamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more\nsophisticated science knowledge graphs."}

The central idea is to represent each method as a\nweighted directed tree, referred to as a computation tree. Leveraging this\nrepresentation, we introduce a general theoretical result that reduces\nconvergence analysis to studying the geometry of these trees. This perspective\nyields a purely graph-based interpretation of optimization dynamics, offering a\nnew and intuitive foundation for method development. Using Birch SGD, we design\neight new methods and analyze them alongside previously known ones, with at\nleast six of the new methods shown to have optimal computational time\ncomplexity. Our research leads to two key insights: (i) all methods share the\nsame \"iteration rate\" of $O\\left(\\frac{(R + 1) L \\Delta}{\\varepsilon} +\n\\frac{\\sigma^2 L \\Delta}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$, where $R$ the maximum \"tree\ndistance\" along the main branch of a tree; and (ii) different methods exhibit\ndifferent trade-offs-for example, some update iterates more frequently,\nimproving practical performance, while others are more communication-efficient\nor focus on other aspects. Birch SGD serves as a unifying framework for\nnavigating these trade-offs.

We propose DRRNet, a\nfour-stage architecture characterized by a \"context-detail-fusion-refinement\"\npipeline to address these issues.

When used with conventional activation\nfunctions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can\nsignificantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random\nLabel and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split\nCIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such\nas class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in\nmitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We\nperform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is\ncrucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network\nthat might be correlated to loss of plasticity."}

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments\nacross four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and\naccelerates policy training by more than 10x."}

Current\nstate-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict\ntorques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e.\nthe joint angles of a predefined skeleton.

However, while these policies\nachieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often\nunderperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on\nnewly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully\ncurated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better\nspecialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream\nperformance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data\nselection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data\nselection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which\ndata points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that\nfilter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual\nsimilarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success,\nallowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that\ndegrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during\nselection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data,\nallowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We\nvalidate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world\nmanipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the\nOpen X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and\nsuperior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the\nimportance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the\npotential of large prior datasets in robotics.

In this paper, we explore two remarkable phenomena\nrelated to the attention mechanism during the fine-tuning of LLMs (where\n$\\mathbf{W}_q$, $\\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\\mathbf{W}_v$ denote the weights of the\nquery, key, and value layers, respectively). The first phenomenon, termed\n\"Unequal Importance of Attention Matrices\", highlights the impact of\nfine-tuning different weight matrices. It shows that optimizing the\n$\\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix yields significantly better performance than optimizing\nthe $\\mathbf{W}_k$ matrix. Fine-tuning only the $\\mathbf{W}_q$ and\n$\\mathbf{W}_v$ matrices is computationally efficient while delivering results\ncomparable to, or even better than fine-tuning all three matrices\n($\\mathbf{W}_q$, $\\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\\mathbf{W}_v$). The second\nphenomenon,\"Attention Matrices with Customized Learning Rate Lead to Better\nConvergence\", emphasizes the importance of assigning distinct learning rates to\nthese matrices. Specifically, a higher learning rate for the $\\mathbf{W}_v$\nmatrix compared to $\\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\\mathbf{W}_k$ accelerates convergence\nand improves performance. Building on these insights, we propose a new strategy\nthat improves fine-tuning efficiency in terms of both storage and time.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of this\napproach, supporting our theoretical findings. Our analysis lays the\ntheoretical groundwork for configuring and improving algorithms in LLMs\nfine-tuning."}

The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces\n(FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on\nthe accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP).\nA generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are\ngenerated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and\nforces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle\nconstraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in\nreproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of\ntheory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the\ndistribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data\nincludes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES.\nHowever, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the\nEQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free\nenergy.

To\nformulate the approach, four ingredients are required: a forward model mapping\nthe unknown parameter to an element of a solution space, often the solution\nspace for a differential equation; an observation operator mapping an element\nof the solution space to the data space; a noise model describing how noise\npollutes the observations; and a prior model describing knowledge about the\nunknown parameter before the data is acquired. This paper is concerned with\nlearning the prior model from data; in particular, learning the prior from\nmultiple realizations of indirect data obtained through the noisy observation\nprocess. The prior is represented, using a generative model, as the pushforward\nof a Gaussian in a latent space; the pushforward map is learned by minimizing\nan appropriate loss function. A metric that is well-defined under empirical\napproximation is used to define the loss function for the pushforward map to\nmake an implementable methodology. Furthermore, an efficient residual-based\nneural operator approximation of the forward model is proposed and it is shown\nthat this may be learned concurrently with the pushforward map, using a bilevel\noptimization formulation of the problem; this use of neural operator\napproximation has the potential to make prior learning from indirect data more\ncomputationally efficient, especially when the observation process is\nexpensive, non-smooth or not known.

SBI addresses this\nlimitation by building an empirical probabilistic model of the data errors\nusing machine learning models, known as neural density estimators, which can\nthen be integrated into the Bayesian inference framework. We apply the SBI\nframework to point-source moment tensor inversions as well as joint moment\ntensor and time-location inversions. We construct a range of synthetic examples\nto explore the quality of the SBI solutions, as well as to compare the SBI\nresults with standard Gaussian likelihood-based Bayesian inversions. We then\ndemonstrate that under real seismic noise, common Gaussian likelihood\nassumptions for treating full-waveform data yield overconfident posterior\ndistributions that underestimate the moment tensor component uncertainties by\nup to a factor of 3. We contrast this with SBI, which produces well-calibrated\nposteriors that generally agree with the true seismic source parameters, and\noffers an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of simulations required to\nperform inference compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques. Finally, we\napply our methodology to a pair of moderate magnitude earthquakes in the North\nAtlantic.
