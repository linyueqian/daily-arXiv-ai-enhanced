While these systems are\ntypically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based\non observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In\naddition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of\nview, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between\nthe categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto\nwhich their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender\ncannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR\ntools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender\nnon-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR\nsystems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender\nexpression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic\nmisgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of\nre-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be\nrecreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output.\nWhile implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing\nthe system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness\nlevels in AGR.

To address this limitation, the paper proposes\nthe Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for\nRPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction\nModule and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning\nperformance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a\nlearned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity\nfor capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper\nintroduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a\nlightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead\nthrough parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental\nevaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior\nperformance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's\nabstract reasoning capabilities."}

The latter results\nfrom the fact that, in TI-DANSE, nodes only have access to the in-network sum\nof all fused signals in the WASN. We address this low convergence speed by\nintroducing an improved TI-DANSE algorithm, referred to as TI-DANSE+, in which\nupdating nodes separately use the partial in-network sums of fused signals\ncoming from each of their neighbors. Nodes can maximize the number of available\ndegrees of freedom in their local optimization problem, leading to faster\nconvergence.

In fully connected WASNs, TI-DANSE+ converges as fast as the original\nDANSE algorithm (the latter only defined for fully connected WASNs) while using\npeer-to-peer data transmission instead of broadcasting and thus saving\ncommunication bandwidth.

In addition, we collect 100\nhigh-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to\ncomprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge\nencoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable\nframework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous\nbenchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and\ncons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I\nbenchmarks.

For this problem, various robust bounded\naggregation (RBA) rules have been proposed at the central server to mitigate\nthe impact of Byzantine attacks. However, current DL methods apply RBA rules\nfor the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information\nfrom Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly\nwhen the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each\nother. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with\nByzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training\nbegins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During\ntraining, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the\nserver computed from the allocated training data, and the server then\naggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices\nusing RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately\nrecovered at the server to update the global model. Compared with current DL\nmethods applying RBA rules, the improvement of CRA-DL is attributed to the fact\nthat the coded gradients sent by the honest devices are closer to each other.\nThis closeness enhances the robustness of the aggregation against Byzantine\nattacks, since Byzantine messages tend to be significantly different from those\nof honest devices in this case. We theoretically analyze the convergence\nperformance of CRA-DL.

The results show that the anechoic room and the\nhearing booth with achievable sound absorption have a difference between the\ntotal sound and the virtual sound below the just-noticeable difference, which\nmeans that the virtual sound is not perceived louder than it should. In\ncontrast, the hearing booth with insufficient sound absorption has a difference\nabove the just-noticeable difference, which means that the virtual sound is\nperceived louder than it should. This study provides a preliminary validation\nof the proposed methodology for assessing the acoustical conditions of\ncustom-made hearing booths in stage acoustics experiments. Future work will\ninclude a more comprehensive analysis of the results, including the effect of\ndifferent sound sources.\n  Supplementary audio files illustrating key simulation results are available\nat https://zenodo.org/records/15579861"}

Since clustering methods are\ntime-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more\npopular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base\ndiscrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we\npropose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary\nbranch devoted to base classification.

In response, the auxiliary\nbranch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a\nvirtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution\nRegularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes.

A widely adopted\nstrategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the\nmodel's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.\nHowever, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely\nreflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As\nbias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from\nthe underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable\nsignal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific\nPrompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing\nperturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These\nrepresentations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful\nview of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically\ngenerates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to\namplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A\ncontrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and\nseparate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic\nbehavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more\nreliable self-assessment.

Interestingly, this is\nachieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of\nmagnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model\nto below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even\nfound to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents\nthe upper bound for speculative decoding."}

However, the very existence of databands and\ntolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We\npropose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a\nhigh-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to\ngenerate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a\nreduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can\ngenerate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second,\nif the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can\nbe updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM\nat whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the\nhigh-fidelity model. We present a single example of this \"point-less\"\narchitecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft\nmodel to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface.

We\nintroduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that\nguarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay\nrate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound\nderived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a\nposterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule\ninvolving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations\nwith Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the\nidentification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate\nthe effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nacross various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The\nresults corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method\noutperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and\nefficiency."}

Detecting such content in Arabic text is particularly complex due to\nlimited labeled data, dialectal variations, and the language's inherent\ncomplexity. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-task\nlearning (MTL) with active learning to enhance offensive speech detection in\nArabic social media text.

Our approach dynamically adjusts\ntask weights during training to balance the contribution of each task and\noptimize performance. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we employ an\nactive learning strategy through several uncertainty sampling techniques to\niteratively select the most informative samples for model training. We also\nintroduce weighted emoji handling to better capture semantic cues.

Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it\nrequires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant\ncode fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target\nvulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4\nstate-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best\ncombination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9%\nreproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing\nhistorical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can\nreveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest\nversions of the software projects."}

Self-supervised\nlearning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised\nstrategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this\napproach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies\nand the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level\nof similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we\npropose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal\nTransport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised\nlearning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies.\nDifferent from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs\nthe optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of\npositive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view\n(central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views\nrepresented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an\noptimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the\nsemantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the\noptimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations,\nforcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the\ngraph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node\nclassification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in\naccuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

One particular setting of interest arises when the target label\nspace is a subset of the source label space, leading to the framework of\npartial domain adaptation (PDA). Typical approaches to PDA involve minimizing a\ndomain alignment term and a weighted empirical loss on the source data, with\nthe aim of transferring knowledge between domains.

This paper presents a systematic empirical study to\ninvestigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our\nstudy involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs,\nnamely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code\ngeneration, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into\nfour types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only,\noutput-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct\ncorresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.\n  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and\ninference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired\ncontamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation.

Apart from the above, other contamination\nscenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the\nconventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance\noverestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of\ncode intelligence models."}

These complexities significantly degrade the performance of\nstate-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific\ndatasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking\nDataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically\ndesigned for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences,\ntotaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object\nclasses: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset\ncaptures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios,\nreflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated\n14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed\nsubstantial performance degradation compared to their performance on\ngeneral-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models\ndemonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of\ndomain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized\ntracking contexts.

Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may\nincrease its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting\ntokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling."}

In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal\nalgorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important\ndimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that\nthe optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal\nstandalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem\nis not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial,\nand illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the\nproperties of the decision-making task even in simple settings.

To answer these questions, we take a construction-based\napproach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from\nsparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a\nsequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and\nnonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs\non a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical\nconcepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are\nunable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE\nrecovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the\nseemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a\nvision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features\nare solely linearly accessible is insufficient.

This complexity not only increases the risk of\nbenchmark misuse and misinterpretation but also demands substantial effort from\nLLM users, seeking the most suitable benchmarks for their specific needs. To\naddress these issues, we introduce \\texttt{BenchmarkCards}, an intuitive and\nvalidated documentation framework that standardizes critical benchmark\nattributes such as objectives, methodologies, data sources, and limitations.\nThrough user studies involving benchmark creators and users, we show that\n\\texttt{BenchmarkCards} can simplify benchmark selection and enhance\ntransparency, facilitating informed decision-making in evaluating LLMs. Data &\nCode: https://github.com/SokolAnn/BenchmarkCards"}

These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs\nin real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing\nthe GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes\nthrough pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by\nrolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two\nchallenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to\n12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results\nhighlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI\nagents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be\nintegrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic\nmemory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error\nrecovery."}

Prior works in\ncomparing LM and human acceptability judgments treat these effects uniformly\nacross models, making a strong assumption that models require the same degree\nof adjustment to control for length and unigram frequency effects. We propose\nMORCELA, a new linking theory between LM scores and acceptability judgments\nwhere the optimal level of adjustment for these effects is estimated from data\nvia learned parameters for length and unigram frequency. We first show that\nMORCELA outperforms a commonly used linking theory for acceptability - SLOR\n(Pauls and Klein, 2012; Lau et al. 2017) - across two families of transformer\nLMs (Pythia and OPT). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the assumed degrees of\nadjustment in SLOR for length and unigram frequency overcorrect for these\nconfounds, and that larger models require a lower relative degree of adjustment\nfor unigram frequency, though a significant amount of adjustment is still\nnecessary for all models. Finally, our subsequent analysis shows that larger\nLMs' lower susceptibility to frequency effects can be explained by an ability\nto better predict rarer words in context."}

This phenomenon, known as performativity,\nintroduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions.\nDespite extensive studies in classification problems across domains,\nperformativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series\nforecasting from a machine-learning perspective.\n  In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS),\naddressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced\ndistribution shifts are possible.

We extend the\nglobal decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual\ncritics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward\nhigh-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the\ncentralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\\lambda$)\nalgorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the\nactor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL,\nmixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This\napproach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely\noff-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of\nSMAC II maps."}

This approach uncovered 2,205 SE PTMs. We find that code\ngeneration is the most common SE task among PTMs, primarily focusing on\nsoftware implementation, while requirements engineering and software design\nactivities receive limited attention. In terms of ML tasks, text generation\ndominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly\nsince 2023 Q2. Our classification provides a solid foundation for future\nautomated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs."}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel method called Similarity Paradigm with Textual\nRegularization (SPTR) for prompt learning without forgetting. SPTR is a\ntwo-pronged design based on hand-crafted prompts that is an inseparable\nframework. 1) To avoid forgetting general textual knowledge, we introduce the\noptimal transport as a textual regularization to finely ensure approximation\nwith hand-crafted features and tuning textual features. 2) In order to\ncontinuously unleash the general ability of multiple hand-crafted prompts, we\npropose a similarity paradigm for natural alignment score and adversarial\nalignment score to improve model robustness for generalization.

This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512\nImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation\nsignificantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion\nmodel and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's\nconditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an\ninvalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with\nsignificantly lower diversity.

This highlights the clear absence of a model capable of processing\n3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data\nto train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as\nthe de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks.\nHowever, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a\ngeneralizable manner remains an open challenge. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene\nunderstanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose\na self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from\nunlabeled scenes. To power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K,\nthe first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising 7916 scenes\nderived from seven established datasets, such as ScanNet and Matterport3D.\nGenerating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 150 GPU\ndays on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning\nfor indoor scenes.

Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this\nrelationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future\ncontexts. We find that a word's prosodic features require an extended past\ncontext (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given\nthat long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate\ncommunication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a\nword's prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with\na short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term\nplanning in language production.

While both\nstrategies have made significant progress, they still face several limitations\nwith histology images. Single-step methods can easily result in under- or\nover-activation due to the limited visual ROI saliency in histology images and\nscarce localization cues.

In this paper, a multi-task\napproach for WSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to\naddress the asynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is\nperformed in the pixel-feature space of an image encoder that is shared with\nclassification.

For instance, on a distance-12 QLDPC\ncode, GraphQEC achieves a logical error rate of $9.55 \\times 10^{-5}$, an\n18-fold improvement over the previous best specialized decoder's $1.74 \\times\n10^{-3}$ under $p=0.005$ physical error rates, while maintaining\n$157\\mu$s/cycle decoding speed. Our approach represents the first universal\nsolution for real-time quantum error correction across arbitrary stabilizer\ncodes."}

While political neutrality-defined as the absence of bias-is often\nseen as an ideal solution for fairness and safety, this position paper argues\nthat true political neutrality is neither feasible nor universally desirable\ndue to its subjective nature and the biases inherent in AI training data,\nalgorithms, and user interactions. However, inspired by Joseph Raz's\nphilosophical insight that \"neutrality [...] can be a matter of degree\" (Raz,\n1986), we argue that striving for some neutrality remains essential for\npromoting balanced AI interactions and mitigating user manipulation. Therefore,\nwe use the term \"approximation\" of political neutrality to shift the focus from\nunattainable absolutes to achievable, practical proxies. We propose eight\ntechniques for approximating neutrality across three levels of conceptualizing\nAI, examining their trade-offs and implementation strategies. In addition, we\nexplore two concrete applications of these approximations to illustrate their\npracticality. Finally, we assess our framework on current large language models\n(LLMs) at the output level, providing a demonstration of how it can be\nevaluated. This work seeks to advance nuanced discussions of political\nneutrality in AI and promote the development of responsible, aligned language\nmodels."}

Training machine learning models to infer\nmissing documentation directly from model weights is challenging, as these\nweights often contain significant variation unrelated to model functionality\n(denoted nuisance). Here, we identify a key property of real-world models: most\npublic models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a\ntree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model).\nImportantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation\nbetween models. Concretely, while learning across Model Trees requires complex\narchitectures, even a linear classifier trained on a single model layer often\nworks within trees. While effective, these linear classifiers are\ncomputationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have\nmany parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a\ntheoretically motivated and lightweight method.

To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA\nthat replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach.\nMETEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is\npreference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using\ndirect preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk\nselection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing\nindividual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance,\nglobal selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context\nexpansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k\nheuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier\nLLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation.\nThe framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using\nrationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation\nacross six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains\nshows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using\napproximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods.

Our contributions are threefold: (1)\nGG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of\ntrained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2)\nDeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight\ndistributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized\ndegradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit\nfloating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash\ntraining, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy.\nExperiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework\nconsistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard\ntraining baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical\nmodeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and\nhardware-aware AI systems.

Our DeepRTE framework demonstrates superior computational\nefficiency for solving the steady-state RTE, surpassing traditional methods and\nexisting neural network approaches. This efficiency is achieved by embedding\nphysical information through derivation of the RTE and mathematically-informed\nnetwork architecture. Concurrently, DeepRTE achieves high accuracy with\nsignificantly fewer parameters, largely due to its incorporation of mechanisms\nsuch as multi-head attention. Furthermore, DeepRTE is a mesh-free neural\noperator framework with inherent zero-shot capability.

However, its performance is highly sensitive to the choice\nof the learning rate. A key limitation of gradient descent is its lack of\nnatural scaling, which often necessitates expensive line searches or heuristic\ntuning to determine an appropriate step size. In this paper, we address this\nlimitation by incorporating Hessian information to scale the gradient\ndirection. By accounting for the curvature of the function along the gradient,\nour adaptive, Hessian-aware scaling method ensures a local unit step size\nguarantee, even in nonconvex settings. Near a local minimum that satisfies the\nsecond-order sufficient conditions, our approach achieves linear convergence\nwith a unit step size. We show that our method converges globally under a\nsignificantly weaker version of the standard Lipschitz gradient smoothness\nassumption.

To address these\nlimits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM),\na new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash\nor risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the\nextent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe\nextreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by\ncontext-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road\nusers. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails\nhigher risk of potential collision.
