Traditional time-series methods\noften reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based\ninformation transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal\nrelationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this\npaper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference\n(ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods,\nACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state\nvariables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic\nevolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of\nquantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an\ninverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward\nfrom observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is\ndetermined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect\nvariables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables.\nACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of\nvariables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over\ntime. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR\nwithout empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional\nproblems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation\ntechniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets.\nNotably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key\nadvantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured.

The linear growth of the KV Cache with\ndialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction\nstrategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early\nconversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting.\nThis paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \\textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism}\nfor KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression\nmethod without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation\nmechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns.\nCompression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs\nof the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of\nolder context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies\nto achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV\ncache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs\neffectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points\nfor input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware\nlimitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show\nthat FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and\nachieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups.
