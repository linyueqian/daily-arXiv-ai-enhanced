This paper addresses the challenge of generating\nclassical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of\ncomposer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive\nCompound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the\nmetrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building\non this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a\nmodel featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the\nComposer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling\nthe role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq\narchitectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual\ninformation and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens\ndecoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE\ngenerates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to\nstate-of-the-art models.

While recent\nadvances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models\nare computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that\ncombines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.\nLike biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast\ncues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel\nDifference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,\nPDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues\nare extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference\nconvolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard\nconvolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.\nAdditionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for\nvideo SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast\ncapture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve\nsignificant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Comprehensive experiments across supervised and\nzero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly\noutperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we\nfurther showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from\nAIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%\nquality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,\nhuman-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2\nand AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS."}

This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse\nActivation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve\nLLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based\npruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input\nactivations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By\nemploying a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve\nconsistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA\nis effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal\nperformance degradation and robust inference acceleration.

To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized.

Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples.

Then we measure how this capability\nrelates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their\ncomprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike.

The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These\ntwo mechanisms have different learning dynamics.\n  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase\ntransitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used\nOLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar\nphenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs\nsecond-task-token performance."}

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nthat the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability\nto learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models\nexhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided\nsolely by the original image.

Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed framework, EIGR, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nin both effectiveness and efficiency."}

Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and\narchitecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search\ndomain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions\nwhere the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of\ninterval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of\nthe nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency,\nthe method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel\nprogramming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a\nvariable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce\ncomputational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method\nis validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable\ndimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy\nfunction, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent\ngrand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global\nminimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not\nbeen reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible\ndomain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10\nbenchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a\nreasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the\nliterature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU\narchitecture."}

However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments."}

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of\ndetailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose\nmapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR\ntools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and\ndosimetric accuracies."}

To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping.

Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven\nmultimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing\nheavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive\nanalysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in\nMLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers\nare responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of\nprecisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety\ntuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by\nthis, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense\nframework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while\nrestoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs\nwhile preserving efficiency.

The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted\nset of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious\ndata samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick\ncommon sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign\nusers during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such\nattacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial\nprocess both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various\naspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's\nutility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive\nexperiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of\nfine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack.\nWe illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment,\nhighlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that\nbias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15)\nto executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive\nstrategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models."}

This work discovers\nthree interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning\nstrategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor\nconvergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second,\nin decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk\nperformance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local\nminima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate\nclassification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local\nminimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In\nother words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and\noptimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower\nexcess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from\nrandom initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The\npaper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and\noptimization error closely.

In reinforcement learning (RL),\nthis translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset,\nfollowed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL\nfine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability\nand performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse\noffline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and in principle, also\nlimit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism\non offline data. In this paper, we show that retaining offline data is\nunnecessary as long as we use a properly-designed online RL approach for\nfine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, we start by\nanalyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. We find\nthat continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a\nsudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by\na distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This\ndivergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of\noffline pre-training. Our approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the\ncatastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple\nidea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very\nsmall number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The\ndata collected during warmup helps ``recalibrate'' the offline Q-function to\nthe online distribution, allowing us to completely discard offline data without\ndestabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. We show that WSRL is able to fine-tune\nwithout retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains\nhigher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they retain\noffline data or not."}

Therefore, this paper aims to\nexplore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with\nimperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three\nrepresentative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate\ncontrol (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how\ninput characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between\nthem make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural\nnetwork-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under\nlimited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the\nthree interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse\nenvironment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating\nimperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL\nagent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping\nand control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,\nachieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively.

A key factor\nis that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking\nmechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a\nsimple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level\nspatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual\nprompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning\ntasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the\nvisual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,\nincluding Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade\nperformance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,\nunderscoring the importance of visual input design over purely\nlinguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual\nstructuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving\ncompositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for\nenhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks."}

However, the high resolution\nand large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying\nDeep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller\npatches with a global label (\\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a\n(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution\nfor WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high\nvariability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15\nAUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL\nmethods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight\ninitialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To\naddress that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL\nmethods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most\nstable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be\napplied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability.

However, they have\nseveral drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant\ncomponents. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning\narchitecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and\nRanging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on\nthe concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex\nand by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,\nthus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used\nto further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention\nNetworks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the\nplant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil.

Whilst convenient, for various MCMC\nalgorithms this results in a synchronization problem -- loosely speaking, at\neach iteration all chains running in parallel must wait until the last chain\nhas finished drawing its sample. In this work, we show how to design\nsingle-chain MCMC algorithms in a way that avoids synchronization overheads\nwhen vectorizing with tools like $\\texttt{vmap}$ by using the framework of\nfinite state machines (FSMs). Using a simplified model, we derive an exact\ntheoretical form of the obtainable speed-ups using our approach, and use it to\nmake principled recommendations for optimal algorithm design. We implement\nseveral popular MCMC algorithms as FSMs, including Elliptical Slice Sampling,\nHMC-NUTS, and Delayed Rejection, demonstrating speed-ups of up to an order of\nmagnitude in experiments."}

To this end, we show that the query complexity of\nbinary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error\nprobability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and\nHolevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely\ncharacterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and\ntwo classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining a tighter\ncharacterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing,\nincluding prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of\nquery complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold.\nWe also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary\nasymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination.\nFor the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\\'enyi and Petz\nR\\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative\nlogarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity.
