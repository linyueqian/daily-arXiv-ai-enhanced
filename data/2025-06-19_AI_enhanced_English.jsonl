This task requires\nMLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding\nnot only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual\nelements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex\ntask often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose\n{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.\nFirst, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To\naccomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of\nstructured instructions: description and difference. The description\ninstruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the\ndifference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference\nchart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual\nfeatures into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent\ncode translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation\npipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,\nenabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show\nthat, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on\nboth the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces ChartIR, an iterative refinement method for improving chart-to-code generation in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by using structured instructions and a two-stage pipeline.", "motivation": "MLLMs struggle with chart-to-code generation due to the need for precise visual understanding and accurate code translation, leading to suboptimal results when directly prompted.", "method": "ChartIR splits the task into visual understanding (using description and difference instructions) and code translation, followed by a two-stage pipeline of initial code generation and iterative refinement.", "result": "The method outperforms others on models like Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.", "conclusion": "ChartIR effectively enhances chart-to-code generation in MLLMs by leveraging structured instructions and iterative refinement."}}

This article contributes\nto this rich body of literature by presenting a new avenue to obtain diffusion\nbridge approximations. Our approach is based on a backward time representation\nof a diffusion bridge, which may be simulated if one can time-reverse the\nunconditioned diffusion. We introduce a variational formulation to learn this\ntime-reversal with function approximation and rely on a score matching method\nto circumvent intractability. Another iteration of our proposed methodology\napproximates the Doob's $h$-transform defining the forward time representation\nof a diffusion bridge.

Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to\nlearn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of\nfaithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this\ntask. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard\nmethods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain\nmeaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom\narrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to\nprior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,\nhighlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the\nstudy of quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "VAEs are adapted for quantum data by incorporating a probabilistic decoder and loss, enabling interpretable latent representations without supervision.", "motivation": "Existing VAEs neglect the probabilistic nature of quantum data, limiting their ability to extract meaningful physical features.", "method": "Two key modifications: a quantum-state-faithful decoder and a probabilistic loss function.", "result": "The modified VAEs successfully learn interpretable latent representations, outperforming standard methods in benchmark quantum spin models and experimental Rydberg atom arrays.", "conclusion": "The approach offers a powerful unsupervised tool for studying quantum systems, autonomously uncovering phase structures without prior knowledge."}}
