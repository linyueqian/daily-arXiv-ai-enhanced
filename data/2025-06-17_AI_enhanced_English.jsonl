D. Dissertation in English(KAIST)", "summary": "Recent research in deep learning-based Sound Event Detection (SED) has\nprimarily focused on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) and\nTransformer models. However, conventional 2D convolution-based models assume\nshift invariance along both the temporal and frequency axes, leadin to\ninconsistencies when dealing with frequency-dependent characteristics of\nacoustic signals. To address this issue, this study proposes Frequency Dynamic\nConvolution (FDY conv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels based\non the frequency composition of the input signal to enhance SED performance.\nFDY conv constructs an optimal frequency response by adaptively weighting\nmultiple basis kernels based on frequency-specific attention weights.\nExperimental results show that applying FDY conv to CRNNs improves performance\non the DESED dataset by 7.56% compared to the baseline CRNN. However, FDY conv\nhas limitations in that it combines basis kernels of the same shape across all\nfrequencies, restricting its ability to capture diverse frequency-specific\ncharacteristics. Additionally, the $3\\times3$ basis kernel size is insufficient\nto capture a broader frequency range. To overcome these limitations, this study\nintroduces an extended family of FDY conv models. Dilated FDY conv (DFD conv)\napplies convolutional kernels with various dilation rates to expand the\nreceptive field along the frequency axis and enhance frequency-specific feature\nrepresentation. Experimental results show that DFD conv improves performance by\n9.27% over the baseline. Partial FDY conv (PFD conv) addresses the high\ncomputational cost of FDY conv, which results from performing all convolution\noperations with dynamic kernels. Since FDY conv may introduce unnecessary\nadaptivity for quasi-stationary sound events, PFD conv integrates standard 2D\nconvolutions with frequency-adaptive kernels to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PFD conv\nimproves performance by 7.80% over the baseline while reducing the number of\nparameters by 54.4% compared to FDY conv. Multi-Dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv)\nextends DFD conv by addressing its structural limitation of applying the same\ndilation across all frequencies. By utilizing multiple convolutional kernels\nwith different dilation rates, MDFD conv effectively captures diverse\nfrequency-dependent patterns. Experimental results indicate that MDFD conv\nachieves the highest performance, improving the baseline CRNN performance by\n10.98%. Furthermore, standard FDY conv employs Temporal Average Pooling, which\nassigns equal weight to all frames along the time axis, limiting its ability to\neffectively capture transient events. To overcome this, this study proposes\nTAP-FDY conv (TFD conv), which integrates Temporal Attention Pooling (TA) that\nfocuses on salient features, Velocity Attention Pooling (VA) that emphasizes\ntransient characteristics, and Average Pooling (AP) that captures stationary\nproperties. TAP-FDY conv achieves the same performance as MDFD conv but reduces\nthe number of parameters by approximately 30.01% (12.703M vs. 18.157M),\nachieving equivalent accuracy with lower computational complexity. Class-wise\nperformance analysis reveals that FDY conv improves detection of non-stationary\nevents, DFD conv is particularly effective for events with broad spectral\nfeatures, and PFD conv enhances the detection of quasi-stationary events.\nAdditionally, TFD conv (TFD-CRNN) demonstrates strong performance in detecting\ntransient events. In the case studies, PFD conv effectively captures stable\nsignal patterns in tank powertrain fault recognition, DFD conv recognizes wide\nharmonic spectral patterns on speed-varying motor fault recognition, while TFD\nconv outperforms other models in detecting transient signals in offshore arc\ndetection.

To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we \"use a\nneural network to prune neural networks\".

In this paper, we first establish a bijective\nmapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural\nnetwork as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning\nstrategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into\nanother network that is much easier to prune.

These representations are adapted\nfor transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process,\npreserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases. We also introduce a\nscale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and\ninter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by\nenhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we\nrefer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly\noutperforms baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating\nits efficiency in bridging the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nand Vision Transformers (ViTs). The components are designed as plug-and-play\nfor different CNN architectures and can be adapted for multiple applications.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/xiaoyatang/DuoFormer.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "A hierarchical transformer model combining CNNs and ViTs for medical diagnosis, outperforming baselines with multi-scale learning and attention mechanisms.", "motivation": "To address the limited exploration of multi-scale learning in transformers for medical applications and the lack of inductive biases in ViTs.", "method": "Uses a CNN backbone for hierarchical visual representations, patch tokenization, and introduces scale-wise attention for intra- and inter-scale associations.", "result": "Significantly outperforms baseline models in classification accuracy, bridging the gap between CNNs and ViTs.", "conclusion": "The model is efficient, adaptable, and plug-and-play for various CNN architectures and applications."}}

Current methods neglect patents'\nhierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International\nClassification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., \"furnishing\")\ninto subclasses (e.g., \"seats\" and \"beds\") and further into specific patent\ndesigns. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive\nloss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the\nretrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent\nimage within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical\ntaxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models\non the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the\nretrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,\nwhich require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments\nwith limited hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "A hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss method is introduced for patent image retrieval, leveraging the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system to improve relevance and efficiency, especially for low-parameter models.", "motivation": "Patent images are complex and current retrieval systems ignore hierarchical relationships like those in the LIC system, limiting their effectiveness.", "method": "Proposes a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that uses LIC's taxonomy to assign multiple positive pairs with varying similarity scores.", "result": "The method improves retrieval results on the DeepPatent2 dataset and works well with low-parameter models, reducing computational needs.", "conclusion": "The approach effectively addresses patent image retrieval challenges by incorporating hierarchical relationships, offering a resource-efficient solution."}}

SemanticST builds multiple\ncontext-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression\nsimilarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for\neach. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,\nbiologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves\nrobustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.\nSemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural\nnetwork scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).\nBenchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and\nmultiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,\nNMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of\nbreast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant\nniches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct\nDCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,\nsuggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus\nprovides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for\nspatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types\nand diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and\nnext-generation precision medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticST is a graph-based deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics, improving data analysis by modeling cellular contexts and scaling to large datasets.", "motivation": "Current spatial transcriptomics methods struggle with noise, scalability, and modeling complex cellular relationships.", "method": "SemanticST constructs multi-semantic graphs (spatial proximity, gene expression, tissue structure) and fuses embeddings using attention.
