It aims to estimate individual causal effect\n(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due\nto the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal\ninference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is\nfundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural\nlearning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries\nare all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can\nencode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized\npopulation per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we\npropose ICI with SCM as a \"rung 3\" causal inference, because it involves\n\"imagining\" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on\nan individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.\nSpecifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent\nthe population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y\n| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI\nwith SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual\ncounterfactuals (non-actual)."}

Previous studies\nhave assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.\nHowever, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards\nare at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes).

In contrast, multiband infrared imagery\nprovides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details\nand enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative\nadversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral\ninformation to enhance the colorization of infrared images.

Unlike\nexisting RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a\nnovel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a\nstructured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent\nsystem orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy\ncreation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for\narticle generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with\nresolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -\nreducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving\nquality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG\nsystems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.\n38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.\nBy automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in\nexperts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:\nreducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating\nself-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future\nsupply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management\nby transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge\nthrough intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime\narchitectures."}

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%\nrecall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a\ncase study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports\ndownstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing\nthe practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing\ninterpretation."}

In\nthis work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a\nstate-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture\nnuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we\nincorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector\n(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant\nbilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable\nimprovements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging\nhigh-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time\npoints (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early\nbreast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/Mortal-Suen/VMRA-MaR.git."}

While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show\npromising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.\nFine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current\nfine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to\nreproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action\nSemantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning\nobjective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,\ninspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for\nApp agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.\nWith this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a\nsemantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the\nsemantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To\nsupport the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior\nrobustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax\nlearning paradigm.

Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess.

The ONH of one eye was imaged\nunder two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated\nto ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects\ninto four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:\n(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full\nsuperior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).\nAutomatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to\ncompute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.\nBiomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning\nmodel. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal\nstep, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For\neach task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area\nunder the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques\nwere employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each\nclassification.\n  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain\nimproved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and\ninferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,\ncontributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive\nexpansion with increasing disease severity.\n  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF\nloss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical\nregion contributing to model predictions."}

In this work we propose a\nphysics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed\nmulti-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the\navailable information to each robot. Our approach has three key\ncharacteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy\nrepresentation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot\nsystems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses\nself-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle\ntime-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we\npresent a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by\nour self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the\ncorrelation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value\nfunction factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot\nscenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous\nmulti-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving\nsimilar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2\ngreater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of\nrobots at training time).

However, it remains unclear\nwhether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.\nTherefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which\naims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the\ngoal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework\nthat learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise\ncan trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level\nperturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic\nembedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To\nimprove stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes\nthe difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring\nthe attack is semantically unnoticeable.

Such tacit collusion is realized by the same\nmechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where\nmutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both\nprisoners in one-shot game.

Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output\nbounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are\nmade, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object\nproposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the\nsubsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D\nbounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training\npipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D\npoint-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on\nmultiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These\nresults show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D\nvideo alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D\nscene understanding."}

Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable\nlimitations.

Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding\nbenchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark."}

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate.

Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs.

We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content.

We employ a structured\nattack framework with three core components: (1) an adversarial prompt\ngeneration strategy leveraging step-by-step reasoning built from LLM-generated\nqueries, (2) an attack mechanism that successfully recalls erased content, and\nexposes unfair suppression of knowledge intended for retention and (3) a\ncategorization of prompts as direct, indirect, and implied, to identify which\nquery types most effectively exploit unlearning weaknesses. Through extensive\nevaluations on four state-of-the-art unlearning techniques and two widely used\nLLMs, we show that existing approaches fail to ensure reliable knowledge\nremoval. Of the generated adversarial prompts, 62.5% successfully retrieved\nforgotten Harry Potter facts from WHP-unlearned Llama, while 50% exposed unfair\nsuppression of retained knowledge. Our work highlights the persistent risks of\ninformation leakage, emphasizing the need for more robust unlearning strategies\nfor erasure."}

The majority of existing backdoor attacks\nfocus on targeted backdoor attacks, where trigger is strongly associated to\nspecific malicious behavior. Various backdoor detection methods depend on this\ninherent property and shows effective results in identifying and mitigating\nsuch targeted attacks. However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor\nscenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what\nmakes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel\nConstrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility\nof untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks. The\ncompromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into\nrandom classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the\nattacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the\nproposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor\ndefense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled\nflexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with\nflipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the\ncompromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target\nclasses, resulting in controlled untargeted attack.

In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best.

To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively.

While prior work has improved the timeliness and\naccuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into\nactionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the\ndecoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can\nsignificantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency\nresponse, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not\njust incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive\nSpatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting\nparadigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework\nensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby\nmaximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new\nResource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively\ncaptures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,\nproducing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate\nactionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent\n(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms\npredictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving\noptimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.\nExperimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction\naccuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics."}

This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium\nto communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that\nleverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.\nImage Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their\nbias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models.

In this study, we propose a point cloud\ncompletion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to\nsilique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation\nframework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation\nmethod and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset\nby distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point\ncloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic\ngraph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict\noccluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph\nconvolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural\nvariations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud\ncompletion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators\nfrom complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated\nthat RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,\nand 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,\nrespectively.

However, acquiring\nlarge-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and\ndifficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for\npersonalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual\nrecognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently\noutperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging\nmulti-concept image captioning task."}

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference.

Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the\nstudent model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed\nand is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from\nthe teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the\ngenerated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and\naugmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence.

To\nalleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating\ntranslation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing\nmaintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention\nbeing a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of\ntranslation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building\ncomplex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these\nstrategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high\ncomputational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated\nwith sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding\nindexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which\nare then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs.

These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting\nwith rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of\ndecomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.\nparallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic\nfidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully\nparsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks\nlike translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality\ndegradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation\nsuite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware\nexecution in LLM serving pipelines."}

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process.

Despite their significant benefits,\nthe tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe\nconsequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare,\nretail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability\nand accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black box behind\nthe LLM and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there\nis little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help\nsolve numerical downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by\nunderstanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted\nto numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy\nin the contextual embedding space. Specifically, a log-linear model for LLMs is\nconsidered in which numerical data can be predicted from its context through a\nnetwork with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in\nself-attention). For this model, it is demonstrated that, in order to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations\nof the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the\nshift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure\nof self-attention in pre-trained models, it is shown how the isotropic property\nof LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying\nstructure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem\nand providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different\ncharacteristics of numerical data and model architectures have different\nimpacts on isotropy, and this variability directly affects the performances."}

To explore this gap, we introduce Bongard-RWR, a\ndataset representing synthetic BP concepts using real-world images. Our\nfindings suggest that weak MLLM performance on classical BPs is not due to the\ndomain specificity, but rather comes from their general AVR limitations.

We provide experiment results to show that\nthe optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model\npretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying\nsolely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to\nguide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical\nanalysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts\nsuboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency\nand effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show\nthe robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such\nas different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler\nchoices."}

We present a\nholistic view of the architecture of LLM-powered malicious traffic detection,\nincluding the procedures of Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Detection.\nEspecially, by exploring the knowledge and capabilities of LLM, we identify\nthree distinct roles LLM can act in traffic classification: Classifier,\nEncoder, and Predictor. For each of them, the modeling paradigm, opportunities\nand challenges are elaborated. Finally, we present our design on LLM-powered\nDDoS detection as a case study. The proposed framework attains accurate\ndetection on carpet bombing DDoS by exploiting LLMs' capabilities in contextual\nmining. The evaluation shows its efficacy, exhibiting a nearly 35% improvement\ncompared to existing systems."}

Existing early-exit\nmethods typically adopt either a joint training approach, where the backbone\nand exit heads are trained simultaneously, or a disjoint approach, where the\nheads are trained separately. However, the implications of this choice are\noften overlooked, with studies typically adopting one approach without adequate\njustification. This choice influences training dynamics and its impact remains\nlargely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a set of metrics to analyze\nearly-exit training dynamics and guide the choice of training strategy.

However, existing methods stabilize training\nand enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random\nlatent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency,\nas we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head\nwith each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint\nyields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor\nperformance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes\nGAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework\nthat enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human\nheads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we\nintroduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator\nconvergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the\nconditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a\ngenerator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also\nfacilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output\nresolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate\na new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions,\nfocuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts\nfor improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by\nhands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering\nquality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D\nscene generation.

This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects.

We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and\ndemonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer\ntypes: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and\ncomputed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients,\nidentifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly\ndifferent survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses\nuncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which\nalign well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the\nmethods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable\nadvancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel\nprognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable\nresults that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical\ndecision-making in oncology and beyond."}

This method works well in\npractice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has\nproven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a\ngeneralization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that\nenables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to\nactivation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such\nactivation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address\nthis problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate\nderivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the\nexisting key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we\nillustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically\ncompare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to\nkernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the\nsurrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL."}

This emotion-cognition cycle minimizes joint\nuncertainty by aligning emotionally weighted priors with context-sensitive\ncognitive appraisals. Subjective experience thus arises as the informational\nfootprint of temporally extended, affect-modulated simulation. We introduce the\nExchangeable Integration Theory of Consciousness (EITC), modeling conscious\nepisodes as conditionally exchangeable samples drawn from a latent affective\nself-model. This latent variable supports integration, via a unified\ncause-effect structure with nonzero irreducibility, and differentiation, by\npreserving contextual specificity across episodes. We connect this architecture\nto the Bayesian theory of consciousness through Rao-Blackwellized inference,\nwhich stabilizes inference by marginalizing latent self-structure while\nenabling adaptive updates. This mechanism ensures coherence, prevents inference\ncollapse, and supports goal-directed simulation. The formal framework builds on\nDe Finetti's exchangeability theorem, integrated information theory, and\nKL-regularized optimal transport.

We also provide detailed insight into the construction of\nparameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output.\nThis agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative\nto a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency\nanalysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training\nprocedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend."}

Existing\napproaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task,\nomitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete\nand explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of\nrobustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework\nthat makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ\na language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules\nfrom the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be\nmanifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in\nprompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in\nrobustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical\nsoftware engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes."}

The RF\nsignals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency\ndomain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected\nwith transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable\ncorrelation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of\nbounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences\nand frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under\nlow signal-to noise ratio situations. Besides, a segmented energy refinement\nmethod is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference signals with\nhigh energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain detection\nparameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the detection\nspeed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames termed as small\ntargets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and speed versus\nsampling duration is established, which helps to meet different drone\nregulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm improves the evaluation metrics by 2.27\\% compared to existing\nalgorithms. The proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under\nvarying flight distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different\nflight visual environment.

We present latent diffusion for full\nprotein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom\nprotein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from\nmolecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural\nnetwork (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein\nconformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,\nsequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent\nrepresentations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by\ndihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a\n2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor\nin a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy\nreproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT\nof approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone\nand side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of\nless than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route\nto system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing\na promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic\ntargets.
