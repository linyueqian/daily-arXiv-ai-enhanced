Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff\nprediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)\nguidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet\ndynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein\nsemantic conditions.

To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector\nQuantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two\nkey modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors\ninto their polar coordinate representations and perform independent\nquantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned\nCodebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude\ncodebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show\nthat PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\\%\nzero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly\ncompressed LLMs."}

These methods, however,\nare usually designed only for a particular process in the AI development\npipeline and do not efficiently use the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This\npaper proposes AutoML-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework tailored for\nfull-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from data retrieval to model deployment.\nAutoML-Agent takes user's task descriptions, facilitates collaboration between\nspecialized LLM agents, and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike existing\nwork, instead of devising a single plan, we introduce a retrieval-augmented\nplanning strategy to enhance exploration to search for more optimal plans. We\nalso decompose each plan into sub-tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural\nnetwork design) each of which is solved by a specialized agent we build via\nprompting executing in parallel, making the search process more efficient.\nMoreover, we propose a multi-stage verification to verify executed results and\nguide the code generation LLM in implementing successful solutions. Extensive\nexperiments on seven downstream tasks using fourteen datasets show that\nAutoML-Agent achieves a higher success rate in automating the full AutoML\nprocess, yielding systems with good performance throughout the diverse domains."}

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning\nframework inspired by the strength training principle of \"progressive overload\"\n(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD\napproaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two\ncore components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training\nsamples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally\nintroduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while\napplying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting\nwith the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the\napproach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning.

We implement the\nmethod using a recently proposed $\\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,\nGP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which\nenables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the\ncontextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further\nintegrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard\nmolecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular\nrediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,\nGP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing\ntraining-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings\nin this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative\nmechanisms of CLMs."}

This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion).

We address this issue through test-time\nrefinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing\nthe data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the\nrefinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that\nsurpass the 2D baseline by a large margin.

This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical\ndistribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental\nresults across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA\noutperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly\nunder limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers\nthe potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but\nalso provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder\nmodels. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks\nassociated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the\nimportance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy.

Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out.

MATP-BENCH consists of 1056\nmultimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level\nmathematics.

Moreover,\nMIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to\n37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive\nmap of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to\nvisually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to\nunlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information\nretrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,\nwhich ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare."}

In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that\nnot only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and\nright-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this\nby fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as\nconditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a\nresult, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo\nvideo datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both\nstereo video generation and restoration.

Moreover, we complement this\nframework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that\nalleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide\ncomprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs\nand 9 adaptation tasks.

Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first\nbenchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs\nbased on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target\noff-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint\nand focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk\nassessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert\nVLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or\nLiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle\nactions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial\ncapability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios\nspanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified\nmultiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings\nin existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in\ncomplex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for\narchitectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning.

In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the\nmultitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would\nhinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge\narises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different\nmagnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to\ninterfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient\nsurgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting\ngradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a\nnovel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery\n(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient\nmagnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS\nsurgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order\nmomentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS\non synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks.

This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind\nbenchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test\ntheory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like\nqualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent\nreasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known\nto not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only\nmeasure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the\nbehavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when\nagents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of\nfunctional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following\na rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are\ncapable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to\nstruggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner\npolicies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not\nnecessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa.\nAchieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction\nhorizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role\nin any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation."}

Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:\n  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree\nwith $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).\n  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree\nwith $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang\n[NeurIPS'17]).\n  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time\nalgorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or\n$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.\nAs such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms\nto outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.\nFurthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new\nstreaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees."}

We\nuse only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific\nsupervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using\nReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts\nbut also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also\nanalyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their\nlength influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings\nhighlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective,\nfairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by\nreasoning flaws."}

To address these problems, we propose a CTDG\nrepresentation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular\nMamba state space model (SSM).

We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory.

Processing individual updates to manage adversarial behavior, while\npreserving the privacy of the data against colluding nodes, requires some sort\nof secure secret sharing. However, the communication load for secret sharing of\nlong vectors of updates can be very high. In federated settings, where users\nare often edge devices with potential bandwidth constraints, excessive\ncommunication overhead is undesirable. ByzSecAgg solves this problem by\npartitioning local updates into smaller sub-vectors and sharing them using ramp\nsecret sharing. However, this sharing method does not admit bilinear\ncomputations, such as pairwise distances calculations, which are needed for\ndistance-based outlier-detection algorithms, and effective methods for\nmitigating Byzantine attacks. To overcome this issue, each user runs another\nround of ramp sharing, with a different embedding of the data in the sharing\npolynomial. This technique, motivated by ideas from coded computing, enables\nsecure computation of pairwise distance. In addition, to maintain the integrity\nand privacy of the local update, ByzSecAgg also uses a vector commitment\nmethod, in which the commitment size remains constant (i.e., does not increase\nwith the length of the local update), while simultaneously allowing\nverification of the secret sharing process. In terms of communication load,\nByzSecAgg significantly outperforms the related baseline scheme, known as BREA."}

However,\nthis has substantial cost implications: larger backbones require more expensive\nhardware (e.g. GPUs with more memory) and lead to higher indexing and querying\ncosts (latency, energy consumption). In this paper, we challenge this paradigm\nby introducing PromptPRF, a feature-based pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF)\nframework that enables small LLM-based dense retrievers to achieve\neffectiveness comparable to much larger models.\n  PromptPRF uses LLMs to extract query-independent, structured and unstructured\nfeatures (e.g., entities, summaries, chain-of-thought keywords, essay) from\ntop-ranked documents. These features are generated offline and integrated into\ndense query representations via prompting, enabling efficient retrieval without\nadditional training. Unlike prior methods such as GRF, which rely on online,\nquery-specific generation and sparse retrieval, PromptPRF decouples feedback\ngeneration from query processing and supports dense retrievers in a fully\nzero-shot setting.\n  Experiments on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks demonstrate that PromptPRF\nconsistently improves retrieval effectiveness and offers favourable\ncost-effectiveness trade-offs. We further present ablation studies to\nunderstand the role of positional feedback and analyse the interplay between\nfeature extractor size, PRF depth, and model performance. Our findings\ndemonstrate that with effective PRF design, scaling the retriever is not always\nnecessary, narrowing the gap between small and large models while reducing\ninference cost."}

We introduce a novel framework, based on Malliavin calculus and\ncentred around a generalisation of the Tweedie score formula to nonlinear\nstochastic differential equations, that enables the development of methods\nrobust to such singularities.

Similarly, Neural Delay Differential\nEquations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of\nDensely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to\ntraditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that\nallow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections\nintroduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern\narchitectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs\ninfluences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying\nthe memory capacity is the product $K \\tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the\ndelay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network\nwidth is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and\nclassical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation\nproperty. We show that if the memory capacity $K\\tau$ is sufficiently small,\nthe dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.\nConsequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack\nthe universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity\n$K\\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation\nproperty of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE\narchitecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which\nuniversal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by\nincreasing the memory capacity $K\\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of\nDDEs with positive delay $\\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump\ntransition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory\nthreshold, universal approximation holds."}
