For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation\nof current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which\nmay be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and\nillustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets."}

Using the Rabbit-Duck illusion, we illustrate how\nperspective-dependent readings of agent behavior can create epistemic\ninstability.

The Mosaic\nenables researchers to examine how misalignment arises not only through policy\nor reward structures but also through language, framing, and design\nassumptions. While this paper focuses on the specific ambiguity between\ncoordination and cooperation, the Mosaic generalizes to other overloaded\nconcepts in MAS, such as alignment, autonomy, and trust. Rather than define\ncooperation once and for all, we offer a framework to diagnose meaning itself\nas a source of misalignment."}

Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by\ncontinually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or\nsimilarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions\nhave typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow\nsettings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind\nlistening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal\nloss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on\nthe synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose\ndifferentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the\navailable literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design\nwith modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss\nfunction performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel\nand established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with\ndifferentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by\n31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,\ncompared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting\nresults."}

Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic\nquestions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user\ncombinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP\nfrom 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive\ncomputational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting\nstrategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%\nrefusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our\nsubmitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness\nand 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question\ncategories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents\nwas the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with\ndocument-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762."}

In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that\nFGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from\nscratch.

In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess.

We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent).

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase\nthat MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency.

In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions.

Second, we\npropose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction\noptimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware\nconstraints.

We validate our method\non two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\\% AUROC\nimprovement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\\% C-index gain in\na UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable\nslide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing\nboth computational and annotation costs."}

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers.

As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously\nimproves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,\ncreating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we\ninvestigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware\ntraining to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the\nscalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that\nTriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model\nparameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite\nof TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained\nperformance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we\npropose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which\ndemonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,\nbuilding on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that\naccelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to\nfloating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of\nTriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.\nOverall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient\nLLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community."}

Traditional\nquanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely\nbeen static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our\nresearch overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,\nsignificantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the\nintroduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities\nin gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing\ngradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel\narchitecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging\nthe concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by\nadding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between\nquanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the\nnetwork, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide\nempirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within\nQuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient\nconfiguration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers\nin the network that eventually results in efficient training.

Next, we introduce the\nAttribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages\ntextual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute\nfeatures from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that\ntextual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate\na Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes\nwithin the same region to share consistent attention maps.

Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code\nwill be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-Guard"}

This study seeks to establish the\ngroundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized\nsearch heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel\nin treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by\napplying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while\npersistently using the $\\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay\nfoundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\\ell_1$-norm, accounting for\nthe suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify\ncorrelations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for\nunbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate\ndiscrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which\nwe show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down\nto the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We\nexplore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose\na procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our\ninvestigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which\nconsistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for\nunbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical\nevidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other\nstrategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the\nreplacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified\nand practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the\n$\\ell_1$-norm over the $\\ell_2$-norm."}

Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable\nsample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based\nmethods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between\nvariables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously\ncharacterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of\nunmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate\nconsistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted\nsettings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings."}

However, the widely adopted\ntwo-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency\ntoward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of\nthe combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm\nthat Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via\nRLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes\nto the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that\nDyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial\nperformance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and\neffective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.\nGitHub: https://github.com/HKUST-LongGroup/DyME"}

First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students.

Traditionally, these models use\nsurface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with\nother geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as\nmeshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has\nexplored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are\neither insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high\ncomputational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we\nintroduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural\nBlend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike\nprior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of\nlearned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,\nsignificantly improving computational efficiency while preserving\nexpressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model\nCOAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,\nand a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact\nmodeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging\ntasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,\n(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)\nscene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections.

To address\nthis, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed\nto effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a\ndual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the\nmodel to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic\nrepresentation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism\nthat enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace\nthe conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate\ninformation loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone\nVehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV\nobject detection tasks."}

This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In crowded\nenvironments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to\nkeep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification\nand action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network\narchitecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust\nits speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume\nescorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong\nbaselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,\nshowcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in\ncomplex, real-world scenarios."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS).

First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,\nPoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D\nspatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human\njudgment.

Furthermore, previous work did not measure humans' performance on\nthe same task as that solved by the PLMs. This means that at this point in\ntime, there is only an incomplete view of models' semantic relation knowledge.\nTo address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework covering\nfive relations beyond hypernymy, namely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy,\nand synonymy.

Adding positive friction, such as explanations or getting user\nconfirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported\ndecision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for\nLLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via\nfriction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with\ndialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM\nwith an additional accountability head that functions as a binary classifier to\npredict the relevant slots of the dialogue state mentioned in the conversation.\nWe perform our experiments with multiple backbone LLMs on two established\nbenchmarks (MultiWOZ and Snips). Our empirical findings demonstrate that the\nproposed approach not only enables reliable estimation of AI agent errors but\nalso guides the decoder in generating more accurate actions. We observe around\n3% absolute improvement in joint goal accuracy (JGA) of DST output by\nincorporating accountability heads into modern LLMs. Self-correcting the\ndetected errors further increases the JGA from 67.13 to 70.51, achieving\nstate-of-the-art DST performance. Finally, we show that error correction\nthrough user confirmations (friction turn) achieves a similar performance gain,\nhighlighting its potential to reduce user overreliance."}

Our review suggests that while the latest AI models are largely\ncapable of producing linguistically and artistically creative outputs such as\npoems, images, and musical pieces, they struggle with tasks that require\ncreative problem-solving, abstract thinking and compositionality and their\ngenerations suffer from a lack of diversity, originality, long-range\nincoherence and hallucinations. We also discuss key questions concerning\ncopyright and authorship issues with generative models. Furthermore, we\nhighlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation of creativity that is\nprocess-driven and considers several dimensions of creativity. Finally, we\npropose future research directions to improve the creativity of AI outputs,\ndrawing inspiration from cognitive science and psychology."}

However, previous work has shown that\nusers' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,\nallocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual\nor image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect\nattention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when\nscrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that\neven simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance\nimprovements over fixed-length models.

To address this challenge, we propose\nTyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions\nas auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time\nstep, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual\ndescriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic\nhurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological\nsemantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the\nnumerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential\ninformation within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model\nto leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical\nfeatures alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,\nresults show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear\npath shifts and limited historical observations."}

For instance, it is well known that the distributed\nversion of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\\frac{h \\sigma^2 L\n\\Delta}{n \\varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where\n$\\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \\in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,\nusing unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the\nvariance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term. However,\nonce we account for the communication from the server to the workers\n$\\tau_{s}$, we prove that it becomes infeasible to design a method using\nunbiased random sparsification compressors that scales both the server-side\ncommunication runtime term $\\tau_{s} d \\frac{L \\Delta}{\\varepsilon}$ and the\nvariance-dependent runtime term $\\frac{h \\sigma^2 L \\Delta}{\\varepsilon^2},$\nbetter than poly-logarithmically in $n$, even in the homogeneous (i.i.d.) case,\nwhere all workers access the same distribution. To establish this result, we\nconstruct a new \"worst-case\" function and develop a new lower bound framework\nthat reduces the analysis to the concentration of a random sum, for which we\nprove a concentration bound. These results reveal fundamental limitations in\nscaling distributed optimization, even under the homogeneous assumption."}

Our benchmark uniquely operates on evolving\nreal-world websites, ensuring a high degree of realism and applicability to\nnatural user tasks. Our data includes 1,050 human-written tasks covering\nvarious domains such as shopping and travel, with each task requiring the agent\nto extract multimodal information from web pages as observations autonomously;\n2) Multihop web browsing. Our dataset features naturally compositional tasks\nthat require information from or actions on multiple websites to solve, to\nassess long-range reasoning capabilities on web tasks; 3) Holistic evaluation.\nWe propose a novel protocol for evaluating an agent's progress in completing\nmultihop tasks. We experiment with both standalone (multimodal) language models\nand heuristic-based web agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while\nlong-chain multihop web tasks are easy for humans, they remain challenging for\nstate-of-the-art web agents.

The activation ratio\n(i.e., $1-\\mathrm{sparsity\\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing\npower-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data\nfor SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate\nthat ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can\nleverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the\nactivation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain\nbottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture\nat a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we\nsurprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly\nwith the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are\ninsensitive to the parameter scale.

Our goal is to achieve\nbackward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such\nas CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we\npropose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's\nembeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text\ndata, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT\nlearning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during\ntraining.

Tempered or generalized posterior distributions are\nfrequently employed as direct and effective solutions. Nonetheless, the\nunderlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of generalized posteriors remain\nactive research topics. In this work, we interpret posterior tempering as a\ncorrection for model misspecification via adjustments to the joint probability,\nand as a recalibration of priors by reducing aleatoric uncertainty. We also\nidentify a unique property of the Laplace approximation: the generalized\nnormalizing constant remains invariant, in contrast to general Bayesian\nlearning, where this constant typically depends on model parameters after\ngeneralization. Leveraging this property, we introduce the generalized Laplace\napproximation, which requires only a simple modification to the Hessian\ncalculation of the regularized loss. This approach provides a flexible and\nscalable framework for high-quality posterior inference.

To support\nscalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894\nlive-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant\nthrough multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated\nInternet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic\ntimestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level\naggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS\nmetric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from\nplatform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in\nthe absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation\nconfirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions\nthrough comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its\nown subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling\nreal-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with\nobjective network-based QoE estimates."}

However, DRO requires\napproximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high\noff-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of\nabsolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning\nOptimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing\nthe need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards\nusing a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a\nstraightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary\nmodels and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on\nthe policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO\non scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder\nmodels. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory\nbaselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings\nconfirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for\nsingle-trajectory policy optimization."}

Accurate segmentation is crucial in\nradiology, as it aids in the precise localization of abnormalities such as\ntumors, thereby enabling effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and\nmonitoring of disease progression. Specifically, the size, shape, and location\nof tumors can significantly influence clinical decision-making and therapeutic\nstrategies, making accurate segmentation a key component of radiological\nworkflows. However, challenges posed by variations in MRI modalities, image\nartifacts, and the scarcity of labeled data complicate the segmentation task\nand impact the performance of traditional models. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel self-supervised learning Multi-encoder nnU-Net\narchitecture designed to process multiple MRI modalities independently through\nseparate encoders. This approach allows the model to capture modality-specific\nfeatures before fusing them for the final segmentation, thus improving\naccuracy. Our Multi-encoder nnU-Net demonstrates exceptional performance,\nachieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 93.72%, which surpasses that\nof other models such as vanilla nnU-Net, SegResNet, and Swin UNETR.

Based on the predicted importance\nscores, the reweighted multi-view features are subsequently fused and input\ninto the end-to-end policy network, enabling seamless integration. Notably, our\nmethod demonstrates outstanding performance in fine-grained manipulations.\nExperimental results show that our approach outperforms multiple baselines by\n22-46% success rate on different tasks. Our work provides new insights and\ninspiration for tackling key challenges in fine-grained manipulations."}

Such environments\nsignificantly increase the risk of collisions, especially for tow trucks and\nsnowplows that must remain operational in challenging conditions. Conventional\ndriver assistance systems often struggle under these conditions due to limited\nvisibility. In contrast, IR cameras, which detect the thermal signatures of\nobstacles, offer a promising alternative. The evaluation combines controlled\nlaboratory experiments, real-world field tests, and surveys of emergency\nvehicle operators. In addition to assessing detection performance, the study\nexamines the feasibility of retrofitting existing Department of Transportation\n(DoT) fleets with cost-effective IR-based driver assistance systems. Results\nunderscore the utility of IR technology in enhancing driver awareness and\nprovide data-driven recommendations for scalable deployment across legacy\nemergency vehicle fleets."}

Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined\nviewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.\nWe introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to\nmulti-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360\nenables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring\nstructural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for\n2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To\nachieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation\nmechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within\nthe latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited\nmulti-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,\nenabling customizable 3D content creation."}
