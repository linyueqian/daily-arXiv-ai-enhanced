It is proposed that affect be\ninterwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags\nalongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations\nresemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the\ncurrent context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven\nemotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in\nthe present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential\ninertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that\nemotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting\nthe theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral\nstatus of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined.

We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a\nnew transformer-based edge-compute-free image coding framework called Easz.\nEasz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the\nheavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a\npatch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional\nuniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side\nthrough a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational\noverhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based\nreconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver\nside.

Corresponding authors: Wonhyuk Ahn and Namhyuk Ahn", "summary": "Multi-bit watermarking (MW) has been designed to enhance resistance against\nwatermarking attacks, such as signal processing operations and geometric\ndistortions. Various benchmark tools exist to assess this robustness through\nsimulated attacks on watermarked images. However, these tools often fail to\ncapitalize on the unique attributes of the targeted MW and typically neglect\nthe aspect of visual quality, a critical factor in practical applications. To\novercome these shortcomings, we introduce a watermarking attack network (WAN),\na fully trainable watermarking benchmark tool designed to exploit\nvulnerabilities within MW systems and induce watermark bit inversions,\nsignificantly diminishing watermark extractability. The proposed WAN employs an\narchitecture based on residual dense blocks, which is adept at both local and\nglobal feature learning, thereby maintaining high visual quality while\nobstructing the extraction of embedded information. Our empirical results\ndemonstrate that the WAN effectively undermines various block-based MW systems\nwhile minimizing visual degradation caused by attacks.

The WAN functions not only as a benchmarking tool but also as an\nadd-on watermarking (AoW) mechanism, augmenting established universal\nwatermarking schemes by enhancing robustness or imperceptibility without\nrequiring detailed method context and adapting to dynamic watermarking\nrequirements.

Traditional control methods, such as reachability and\ncontrol barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when\ninteractions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts\nbetween the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe\nmulti-agent coordination.\n  To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple\nlayers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to\nlearn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple\nindicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to\nresult in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for\nagents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the\nmost urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides\ntactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design\ndecisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability\nanalysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism.\n  We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using\nCrazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation\nscenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding\ncollisions.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance.\n  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,\n\\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and\nmulti-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system\nself-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs\nwith intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic\ntraining data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,\nwhich are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and\nunsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information\nsufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG\nsystem has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval\ndecisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context\nreinforcement learning.\n  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an\neffective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is\nsystem-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring\nmodifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,\neliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process\nsupervision data."}

However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize\ninformation from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and\nits inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper,\nwe introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution\n(SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the\nissues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous\napproaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images\nmore accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a\nTwo-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image\nalignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more\naccurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged\ntextures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and\nfusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we\npropose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the\nfeature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature\nAggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture\naggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively\ngenerating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise\nattention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra\ninteractions.

Our method applies a\nlayer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and\nasymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to\noptimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless\ncompression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth\nrequirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which\nenables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring\nminimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including\nsmolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct,\ndemonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30%$ storage reduction compared to\nuint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while\npreserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further\nshow that our method enables $31.9%$ - $146.6%$ faster inference throughput on\nmemory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing\nthe required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional\nre-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization\nmethods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs."}

However, the attention\nweights, which capture dependencies between pixels or keypoints, are often\nlearned from scratch. This approach can introduce redundancy and noisy\ninteractions from irrelevant regions, as it treats all pixels or keypoints\nequally. Drawing inspiration from keypoint selection processes, we propose to\nfirst classify all pixels into two categories: matchable and non-matchable.\nMatchable pixels are expected to receive higher attention weights, while\nnon-matchable ones are down-weighted. In this work, we propose a novel\nattention reweighting mechanism that simultaneously incorporates a learnable\nbias term into the attention logits and applies a matchability-informed\nrescaling to the input value features. The bias term, injected prior to the\nsoftmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence\nof query-key interactions.

This paper\ndefines an aggregation query on subspace defined by a range on the partial\norder on coordinate tree at each dimension, where each point contains resources\naggregated along the paths of partial order relations on the points so that\naggregated resources at each point within the subspace can be measured, ranked\nand selected. To efficiently locate non-empty points in a large subspace, an\napproach to generating graph index is proposed to build inclusion links with\npartial order relations on coordinates of dimensions to enable a subspace query\nto reach non-empty points by following indexing links and aggregate resources\nalong indexing paths back to their super points. Generating such an index is\ncostly as the number of children of an index node can be very large so that the\ntotal number of indexing nodes is unbounded. The proposed approach adopts the\nfollowing strategies to reduce the cost: (1) adding intersection links between\ntwo indexing nodes, which can better reduce query processing costs while\ncontrolling the number of nodes of the graph index; (2) intersection links are\nadded between two nodes according to the probabilistic distribution calculated\nfor estimating the costs of adding intersection between two nodes; (3)\ncoordinates at one dimension having more resources are split by coordinates at\nanother dimension to balance the number of resources hold by indexing nodes;\nand, (4) short-cut links are added between sibling coordinates of coordinate\ntrees to make an efficient query on linear order coordinates.

As\nthis iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,\nlayer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often\nresults in memory overload or high inference latency.

It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data\ndistribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples\nfrom the data distribution. However, when the empirical data distribution\nconsists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will\nnecessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to\nas the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine\nlearning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the\nmemorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end\nof the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model\nrequires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not\nrequire any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model\nsample distribution is an $O\\left(n^{-\\frac{2}{d+4}}\\right)$ Wasserstein-1\napproximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension\n$d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance\nbetween population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the\ninertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper\nbound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no\ntraining involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion\nmodel samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density\nestimator on the manifold.

The\nbit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA\nneural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across\ndifferent signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that\nDAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing\nneural receiver models. The computational efficiency of the proposed neural\nreceivers supports their feasibility for next generation communication systems."}

Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained\nconsiderable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most\nexisting methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models,\noverlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they\nrely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect\nlong-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases\ninherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and\ndata imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a\nmore critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing\nre-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be\neffectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the\nlogits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances\nsimultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete\nsemantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between\ninput samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a\nnovel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between\ninput samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the\ndata.

In this paper, we\nadopt the recently introduced structure-agnostic framework of statistical lower\nbounds, which poses no structural properties on the nuisance functions other\nthan access to black-box estimators that achieve some statistical estimation\nrate. This framework is particularly appealing when one is only willing to\nconsider estimation strategies that use non-parametric regression and\nclassification oracles as black-box sub-processes.

Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge\nof problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence.

SE Arena provides a transparent,\nopen-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and\nenables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics,\nincluding model consistency score that measures the consistency of model\noutputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that\nevaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction\nrounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new\nfeature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context\n(e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning\nevaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the\ndesign and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the\nevaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering."}

In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways\nmounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end\ndevices and transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to\nmaximize the global system energy efficiency of wireless LoRa networks by joint\noptimization of transmission power, spreading factor, bandwidth, and user\nassociation. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as a\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa GW\nacts as a learning agent using a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MARL).

Traditional approaches\noften treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning.\nWhile recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in\nmulti-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for\nhigh-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model\nto build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and\nsurrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained\non real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates\nhigher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion\nmodels, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple\nplanning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online\nguided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset\n(WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and\nalso demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and\nsatisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget."}

Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with\ncarefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the\nreasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic\ncorrectness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose\na reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively\nbalances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of\nunconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and\nbenchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art\nconstrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up\nto 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic\nreasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO."}

Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in\nimproved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability,\nwhich is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and\nimprove upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact\nfunctions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a\nneural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale\nevent sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than\ntraditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches,\nand allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding\ntransformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings.\nResults show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in\nsimulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset,\nand gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children\ndiagnosis dataset even without transformer layers.
