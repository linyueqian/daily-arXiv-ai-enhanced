*Yanyan Wang, Yingying Wang, Junli Liang, Yin Xu, Yunlong Liu, Yiming Xu, Zhengwang Jiang, Zhehe Li, Fei Li, Long Zhao, Kuang Xu, Qi Song, Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleEval-OS, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling, covering 15 datasets and 13 subtasks. It assesses 14 LLMs, showing open-source models can outperform closed-source ones in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and lack of benchmarks for LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling motivated the creation of TeleEval-OS to evaluate their potential.

Method: TeleEval-OS includes 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, simulating four operational stages. It uses zero-shot and few-shot methods to evaluate 14 LLMs (10 open-source, 4 closed-source).

Result: Open-source LLMs outperformed closed-source ones in specific scenarios, demonstrating their potential in telecommunications operation scheduling.

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS fills a critical gap, showing LLMs' value in telecommunications operation scheduling, with open-source models excelling in some cases.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

### [2] [Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11063)
*Jiayu Yao, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Baolong Bi, Yuyao Ge, Zhecheng Li, Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates position bias in multimodal RAG systems, revealing a U-shaped accuracy curve and introducing metrics like PSI_p to quantify and visualize bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG models are sensitive to evidence order, leading to unstable performance and bias, especially with increasing retrieval complexity or modality diversity.

Method: Controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, introducing PSI_p and a visualization framework for attention patterns.

Result: Multimodal interactions intensify position bias, which increases logarithmically with retrieval range.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for position-aware strategies like evidence reordering or debiasing to improve RAG system reliability and fairness.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

*Alexey Tikhonov, Sergei Shteiner, Anna Bykova, Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of Russenorsk lexicon using LLMs, constructing a dictionary and testing hypotheses on word formation and grammar, with a translation agent for reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unique linguistic phenomenon of Russenorsk and leverage modern LLMs for analysis and reconstruction.

Method: Construct a structured dictionary from literary sources, test hypotheses using LLMs, and develop a translation agent.

Result: Hypotheses from LLMs align with academic literature; a Russenorsk translation agent is created.

Conclusion: LLMs effectively aid in analyzing and reconstructing Russenorsk, validating historical linguistic hypotheses.

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A cost-effective LLM-based pipeline for extracting ROS entities from clinical notes, comparing open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT, with ChatGPT showing the lowest error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the burden of ROS documentation in healthcare by automating entity extraction from clinical notes.

Method: Uses SecTag for ROS section extraction and few-shot LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma, ChatGPT) for identifying ROS entity spans, status, and body systems. Evaluated on 36 notes with 341 annotated entities.

Result: ChatGPT achieved the lowest error rates (28.2% for spans, 14.5% for status/systems). Open-source LLMs showed promising performance (30.5-36.7% for spans, 24.3-27.3% for status/systems).

Conclusion: The pipeline is scalable and locally deployable, with open-source LLMs being a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [5] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park, Jinsil Lee, Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show a bias (Deontological Keyword Bias) where they interpret non-obligatory scenarios as obligations when prompts include modal expressions like 'must' or 'ought to'. A mitigation strategy using few-shot examples and reasoning prompts is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs handle moral and ethical reasoning, specifically their tendency to misjudge non-obligatory contexts as obligations due to linguistic framing.

Method: Analyzed LLM responses to commonsense scenarios with and without modal expressions, proposing a mitigation strategy combining few-shot examples and reasoning prompts.

Result: LLMs judged over 90% of scenarios as obligations when modal expressions were present, showing consistency across models and question types.

Conclusion: Modal expressions significantly bias LLM judgments, highlighting the need for strategies like few-shot reasoning to align judgments with human norms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

### [6] [Targeted control of fast prototyping through domain-specific interface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11070)
*Yu-Zhe Shi, Mingchen Liu, Hanlu Ma, Qiao Xu, Huamin Qu, Kun He, Lecheng Ruan, Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an interface architecture to bridge the gap between natural language instructions and modeling languages for precise control of prototype models using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial designers need intuitive, language-based control of prototype models without complex commands, but current LLMs underutilize this potential due to language gaps.

Method: Develops an interface architecture with an operational mechanism and algorithm for automated domain specification, grounded in fast prototyping design principles.

Result: Machine and human evaluations show the interface enables precise and effective control of prototype models across design domains.

Conclusion: The interface serves as an auxiliary module for LLMs, bridging language gaps for targeted model control.

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [7] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye, Qiming Li, Xiaocheng Feng, Libo Qin, Yichong Huang, Baohang Li, Kui Jiang, Yang Xiang, Zhirui Zhang, Yunfei Lu, Duyu Tang, Dandan Tu, Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM is a near training-free method to reduce multilingual object hallucination in LVLMs by aligning cross-lingual attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit higher object hallucination in non-English queries due to disparities in cross-modal attention patterns.

Method: CLAIM identifies language-specific attention heads, estimates shift vectors, and intervenes during inference to align attention.

Result: CLAIM improves performance by 13.56% on POPE and 21.75% on MME benchmarks, with up to 30% gains in Spanish.

Conclusion: Multilingual attention divergence is prominent in intermediate layers, emphasizing their importance in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

### [8] [CyclicReflex: Improving Large Reasoning Models via Cyclical Reflection Token Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11077)
*Chongyu Fan, Yihua Zhang, Jinghan Jia, Alfred Hero, Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyclicReflex, a method to dynamically regulate reflection tokens in large reasoning models (LRMs) to optimize performance, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessive or insufficient use of reflection tokens (over-reflection or under-reflection) degrades LRM performance, necessitating a balanced allocation strategy.

Method: Proposes CyclicReflex, a decoding strategy using a position-dependent triangular waveform to modulate reflection token logits dynamically.

Result: CyclicReflex improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B) on benchmarks like MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023, surpassing standard decoding and recent methods.

Conclusion: CyclicReflex effectively manages reflection token allocation, enhancing LRM performance, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

*Yuzhou Yang, Yangming Zhou, Zhiying Zhu, Zhenxing Qian, Xinpeng Zhang, Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoE-FND is a framework for Fake News Detection (FND) that combines LLMs with experiential learning, addressing noise, generalization, and bias issues through logical deduction and case-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FND methods suffer from noisy evidence, poor generalization, and unclear decision-making. LLMs introduce new challenges like hallucinated rationales and bias.

Method: RoE-FND uses two stages: self-reflective knowledge building (analyzing past errors) and dynamic criterion retrieval (synthesizing reasoning guidelines). It includes a dual-channel rationale cross-check.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization and effectiveness across three datasets, without requiring training.

Conclusion: RoE-FND effectively addresses FND challenges by leveraging experiential learning and logical deduction, offering a robust, adaptable solution.

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

*Han Zhou, Qitong Xu, Yiheng Dong, Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MANBench is a bilingual benchmark evaluating MLLMs against human performance in multimodal tasks, revealing gaps in cross-modal reasoning and complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if MLLMs can surpass human performance in multimodal tasks and identify their limitations.

Method: Developed MANBench with 1,314 questions across nine tasks, comparing human and MLLM performance through experiments.

Result: MLLMs excel in knowledge-based tasks but struggle with cross-modal reasoning and complex tasks like puzzles.

Conclusion: MANBench underscores MLLMs' limitations and aims to inspire improvements to bridge the gap with human capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

*Aditi, Hyunwoo Park, Sicheol Sung, Yo-Sub Han, Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE uses LLMs and reinforcement learning to generate valid and general CCFGs from natural language specs, outperforming 17 LLMs in grammar quality and test effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating valid and general grammars from natural language specs is challenging, especially with limited supervision.

Method: Fine-tunes an open-source LLM for spec-to-grammar translation, applies GRPO for validity/generality, and uses iterative feedback for error correction.

Result: SAGE improves grammar validity by 15.92%p and test effectiveness by 12.34%p over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates strong generalization and outperforms existing LLMs in grammar generation and testing.

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

*Lionel Levine, John Santerre, Alex S. Young, T. Barry Levine, Francis Campion, Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a transformer-based model for sequential clinical decision-making, predicting next steps in patient diagnostics with improved accuracy over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of isolated diagnostic classification by modeling clinical trajectories as sequences of events for better predictive reasoning.

Method: Uses a transformer architecture with a custom clinical vocabulary and autoregressive training to predict next steps in patient diagnostic journeys.

Result: Shows significant improvements in next-token prediction, generating realistic diagnostic pathways and clinician behaviors.

Conclusion: PRISM successfully applies generative language modeling to medical data, paving the way for clinical decision support and education.

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

*Ali Asad, Stephen Obadinma, Radin Shayanfar, Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate is a multi-agent debate framework using adversarial argumentation among LLMs to identify and mitigate unsafe behaviors, achieving up to 23.5% reduction in unsafe behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety methods rely on costly human evaluations or single-model assessments, which are not scalable or robust.

Method: Uses multi-agent debates and red-teaming to uncover unsafe behaviors, integrating long-term memory to retain safety insights.

Result: Debate alone reduces unsafe behaviors by 17.7%, and with memory modules, reductions exceed 23.5%.

Conclusion: RedDebate is the first fully automated framework combining multi-agent debates and red-teaming to enhance AI safety without human intervention.

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

*Pengbo Wang, Chaozhuo Li, Chenxu Wang, Liwen Zheng, Litian Zhang, Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPACE is a unified framework that jointly improves factuality and faithfulness in LLMs by editing shared activation subspaces, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from factuality and faithfulness hallucinations, and current methods addressing these issues independently create performance trade-offs.

Method: SPACE uses dual-task feature modeling to identify shared subspaces and edits them via spectral clustering and attention head saliency scoring.

Result: Experiments show SPACE outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPACE provides a unified solution to mitigate both hallucination types in LLMs effectively.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

*Shaoshi Ling, Guoli Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach improves ASR performance on rare named entities by using LLM feedback for domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with rare named entities and domain mismatches, while LLMs excel across domains. This work aims to bridge the gap by leveraging LLMs for ASR improvement.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with LLM feedback to fine-tune ASR models, scoring hypotheses for reward signals.

Result: Achieves a 21% improvement in entity word error rate over self-training methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances ASR performance for domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

TL;DR: DCT extends RAG for dynamic domains by enabling multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without retraining, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are static and single-turn, making them unsuitable for dynamic domains like healthcare and smart homes where context evolves.

Method: DCT uses an attention-based context cache, LoRA-based retrieval, and efficient context compression to adapt dynamically.

Result: DCT improves plan accuracy by 14%, reduces hallucinations by 37%, and matches GPT-4 performance at lower cost.

Conclusion: DCT is scalable and adaptable, generalizing to unseen tools, making it suitable for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

*Songyang Liu, Chaozhuo Li, Jiameng Qiu, Xi Zhang, Feiran Huang, Litian Zhang, Yiming Hei, Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews advancements in LLM safety evaluation, covering motivations, tasks, metrics, methods, and challenges, emphasizing the need for safe deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid deployment of LLMs has raised safety concerns (e.g., toxicity, bias), but lacks systematic reviews of evaluation efforts.

Method: The survey categorizes safety evaluation into four aspects: why, what, where, and how to evaluate, including tasks, metrics, datasets, and methods.

Result: It identifies key safety dimensions (toxicity, robustness, ethics, etc.) and reviews evaluation tools and methods.

Conclusion: Challenges and future research directions are highlighted, stressing the importance of safety evaluation for real-world LLM deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

### [18] [Benchmarking Foundation Speech and Language Models for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Detection from Spontaneous Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11119)
*Jingyu Li, Lingchao Mao, Hairong Wang, Zhendong Wang, Xi Mao, Xuelei Sherry Ni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks foundation models for early ADRD detection using speech and language features, finding ASR-derived embeddings most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of ADRD is crucial, and speech markers offer non-invasive biomarkers. Foundation models provide high-dimensional embeddings for this purpose.

Method: Used the PREPARE Challenge dataset (1,600+ participants) to benchmark speech and language models for classifying cognitive status (HC, MCI, AD).

Result: Whisper-medium (speech) and BERT with pause annotation (language) performed best. ASR-derived embeddings outperformed others, with pause patterns improving text-based classification.

Conclusion: ASR-derived embeddings show promise for scalable, non-invasive ADRD detection, supported by a benchmarking framework.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

*Manuel D. S. Hopp, Vincent Labatut, Arthur Amalvy, Richard Dufour, Hannah Stone, Hayley Jach, Kou Murayama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to model reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps in text, using BERTopic and persistent homology, and validates it with empirical data from 'The Hunger Games'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reader curiosity is key for engagement but underexplored in NLP. The study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging Information Gap Theory.

Method: Uses BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze semantic network topology (connected components, cycles, voids) as proxies for information gaps.

Result: Topological features significantly improve curiosity prediction (73% vs. 30% explained deviance) compared to a baseline.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a novel computational method for analyzing text structure's impact on reader engagement.

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

*Wei-Ping Huang, Guan-Ting Lin, Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUTA-LM combines TTA with language model rescoring to address domain mismatches in ASR, achieving robust performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world domain mismatches in ASR degrade performance, and TTA with language model rescoring is not straightforward due to interference.

Method: SUTA-LM extends SUTA with controlled adaptation (using acoustic and linguistic info) followed by language model rescoring.

Result: Experiments on 18 ASR datasets show SUTA-LM's robustness across domains.

Conclusion: SUTA-LM effectively combines TTA and language model rescoring, mitigating domain mismatch issues.

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

### [21] [C-SEO Bench: Does Conversational SEO Work?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11097)
*Haritz Puerto, Martin Gubri, Tommaso Green, Seong Joon Oh, Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-SEO Bench, a benchmark to evaluate Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO) methods across tasks, domains, and actor adoption rates, revealing current methods' ineffectiveness compared to traditional SEO strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about the effectiveness of C-SEO methods across diverse domains and multi-actor competitive scenarios.

Method: Developed C-SEO Bench, evaluating C-SEO methods on tasks like question answering and product recommendation across three domains, with varying adoption rates.

Result: Current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective; traditional SEO strategies outperform them. Gains diminish as more actors adopt C-SEO, indicating a zero-sum problem.

Conclusion: C-SEO Bench highlights the limitations of current C-SEO methods and the superiority of traditional SEO, emphasizing the need for better approaches in multi-actor scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

### [22] [A Self-Refining Framework for Enhancing ASR Using TTS-Synthesized Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11130)
*Cheng Kang Chou, Chan-Jan Hsu, Ho-Lam Chung, Liang-Hsuan Tseng, Hsi-Chun Cheng, Yu-Kuan Fu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung-Yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-refining framework improves ASR performance using unlabeled data by generating pseudo-labels, training a TTS system, and bootstrapping synthetic data back into ASR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings without requiring labeled datasets.

Method: Uses pseudo-labels from an existing ASR model to train a TTS system, then bootstraps synthesized speech-text pairs back into ASR.

Result: Twister, a specialized model, reduces error rates by 20% on Mandarin and 50% on code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper.

Conclusion: The framework is a practical alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation for improving ASR in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

*Jiachen Zhu, Menghui Zhu, Renting Rui, Rong Shan, Congmin Zheng, Bo Chen, Yunjia Xi, Jianghao Lin, Weiwen Liu, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to differentiate AI agents from LLM chatbots and categorizes evaluation benchmarks, offering guidance for researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks confuse distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, necessitating a clear analytical framework.

Method: A systematic analysis of evaluation approaches, differentiating AI agents from chatbots along five key aspects and categorizing benchmarks.

Result: A detailed framework and reference tables for evaluation attributes, synthesized trends, and future methodologies.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidance for researchers to select benchmarks, advancing AI agent evaluation.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

### [24] [You Only Fine-tune Once: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-Tuning for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11103)
*Wenchong He, Liqian Peng, Zhe Jiang, Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL), a method that improves in-context learning (ICL) by treating many-shot examples as training targets, narrowing the performance gap with dedicated fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current few-shot ICL methods lag behind dedicated fine-tuning. The goal is to enhance ICL performance by leveraging many-shot examples more effectively.

Method: Proposes ManyICL, where many-shot examples are used as supervised training targets for autoregressive learning, improving efficiency and performance.

Result: ManyICL outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning, approaches dedicated fine-tuning performance, and reduces catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: ManyICL is a promising approach for enhancing ICL, offering performance close to dedicated fine-tuning while mitigating key limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

*Hanzhi Zhang, Heng Fan, Kewei Sha, Yan Huang, Yunhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A dynamic sparse attention mechanism (DAM) is introduced to improve efficiency and adaptability in long-context NLP tasks by learning context-aware attention structures, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face inefficiency in long-context tasks due to quadratic self-attention complexity. Sparse attention methods with static masks fail to capture diverse patterns, limiting adaptability and accuracy.

Method: DAM dynamically assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads without predefined structures or fine-tuning.

Result: The method aligns closely with full-attention models, minimizing performance loss while reducing memory and compute costs, enabling scalable deployment of large LLMs.

Conclusion: DAM offers a practical, efficient alternative to full attention for long-context NLP tasks, balancing performance and computational demands.

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel medical assistant system compresses LLMs for edge devices via neuron pruning and quantization, achieving real-time inference on low-power hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are too large for real-time, resource-constrained healthcare environments like edge devices.

Method: Neuron saliency-based pruning and post-training quantization to reduce model size while preserving performance.

Result: 50% compressed Gemma and 67% compressed LLaMA3 models run efficiently on Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5.

Conclusion: The framework enables energy-efficient, real-time LLM deployment in specialized domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

*Ningyuan Li, Junrui Liu, Yi Shan, Minghui Huang, Tong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PankRAG improves RAG methods by addressing entity-level extraction limitations with a hierarchical query-resolution strategy and dependency-aware reranking, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods rely on entity extraction, risking misinterpretation or omission of critical information, leading to irrelevant or contradictory results.

Method: PankRAG uses a multi-level resolution path for structured reasoning and a dependency-aware reranker to validate retrieval results.

Result: Empirical evaluations show PankRAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks.

Conclusion: PankRAG enhances retrieval fidelity and reduces hallucination risks, proving robust and generalizable.

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

TL;DR: The study explores how varying frame rates in speech tokenizers affect Mandarin and English, revealing language-specific impacts on semantic tokens and suggesting optimization insights for speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underexplored impact of frame rates on speech tokenization, especially in typologically distinct languages like Mandarin and English.

Method: Encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in speech recognition tasks for Mandarin and English.

Result: Frame rate variations differently influence speech tokenization for each language, affected by phonetic density and language-specific acoustic features.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for optimizing frame rate selection in speech tokenizers, benefiting applications like automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech.

Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally
serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While
low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of
frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we
investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining
Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at
different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech
recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence
speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay
between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features.
The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech
tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech,
and other speech-related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the original single-turn CAGSR framework for handling multi-turn dialogues and chain-of-thought reasoning efficiently.

Method: Implemented on vLLM runtime with asynchronous capture of cross-attention weights, generalized reward function for conversation histories, and entropy-based clamping.

Result: Improved handling of multi-turn dialogues and chain-of-thought reasoning with attention-based rewards.

Conclusion: Future directions include multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning, with practical trade-offs addressed.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

### [30] [Enhancing Large Language Models for Mobility Analytics with Semantic Location Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11109)
*Yile Chen, Yicheng Tao, Yue Jiang, Shuai Liu, Han Yu, Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QT-Mob enhances LLMs for mobility analytics by introducing semantic location tokens and complementary fine-tuning objectives, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based mobility analytics methods lack semantic location representation and effective modeling of mobility signals.

Method: QT-Mob uses a location tokenization module for semantic location tokens and complementary fine-tuning objectives to align with LLMs.

Result: Superior performance in next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: QT-Mob improves LLMs' mobility data interpretation and offers a generalizable approach for mobility analytics.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

*Jaeho Lee, Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench evaluates LLMs' consistency in truth evaluation when faced with directional framing of facts, aiming to measure their ability to resist user influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how LLMs handle contradictory user assertions about factually true statements.

Method: Sampling evidence-backed facts from FEVEROUS, constructing opposing framing prompts, and recording model agreement and reasoning.

Result: The benchmark isolates framing-induced variability from factual knowledge, assessing LLMs' consistency in truth evaluation.

Conclusion: AssertBench measures LLMs' ability to maintain factual consistency despite contradictory user assertions.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

### [32] [Evaluating and Improving Robustness in Large Language Models: A Survey and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11111)
*Kun Zhang, Le Wu, Kui Yu, Guangyi Lv, Dacao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey on the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, evaluation methods, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for robust LLMs in diverse applications by providing a comprehensive review of concepts, methods, and tools.

Method: The survey defines LLM robustness, categorizes perturbations (adversarial and OOD), and reviews evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools.

Result: Organized a thorough review of LLM robustness, including a GitHub repository for community access.

Conclusion: Highlights future opportunities and research directions, emphasizing the importance of robust LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of LLMs as automated peer reviewers, highlighting vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and proposing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of academic submissions burdens human reviewers, prompting exploration of LLMs for assistance, but their susceptibility to adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs' review generation effectiveness, adversarial attack impact, and mitigation strategies through comprehensive analysis.

Result: LLMs show significant vulnerabilities to adversarial text manipulations, which can distort their review assessments.

Conclusion: Addressing adversarial risks is crucial to ensure AI enhances, rather than undermines, scholarly communication integrity.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

*Junyu Liu, Kaiqi Yan, Tianyang Wang, Qian Niu, Momoko Nagai-Tanima, Tomoki Aoyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KokushiMD-10 is a multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in healthcare, based on Japanese licensing exams, covering diverse fields and incorporating clinical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited—text-based, English-centric, and medicine-focused—highlighting the need for broader, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation in healthcare.

Method: KokushiMD-10 includes 11,588 real exam questions from ten Japanese healthcare licensing exams, featuring clinical images and expert rationales to assess textual and visual reasoning.

Result: Over 30 LLMs were tested, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, but none consistently passed across all domains, revealing gaps in medical AI.

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10 addresses benchmarking gaps, offering a resource to advance multilingual, multimodal medical AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

*Yerim Oh, Jun-Hyung Park, Junho Kim, SungHo Kim, SangKeun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATTER is a novel tokenization method for materials science that integrates domain knowledge to prevent fragmentation and semantic loss, outperforming existing methods by 4% in generation and 2% in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods for language models in materials science cause excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, compromising structural and semantic integrity.

Method: MATTER combines a MatDetector trained on a materials knowledge base with a re-ranking method to prioritize material concepts during token merging.

Result: MATTER achieves a 4% performance gain in generation tasks and 2% in classification tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Domain-specific knowledge is crucial for effective tokenization in scientific text processing, as demonstrated by MATTER's success.

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct is a high-quality instruction dataset designed to improve LLMs' foundational and chat capabilities, outperforming proprietary models like GPT-4 in some tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source instruction datasets are narrow in scope, limiting LLM generalization and widening the gap with proprietary models.

Method: A two-phase pipeline: Phase 1 curates 7.4M foundational instructions; Phase 2 synthesizes 1.5M chat instructions through selection, evolution, and filtering.

Result: Fine-tuned models (e.g., InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B) outperform GPT-4-0314 by 8.6% in instruction tasks and match foundational performance.

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct bridges the gap with proprietary models, demonstrating the synergy between foundational and chat training for holistic LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

*Junyong Lin, Lu Dai, Ruiqian Han, Yijie Sui, Ruilin Wang, Xingliang Sun, Qinglin Wu, Min Feng, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScIRGen is a framework for generating realistic scientific QA & retrieval datasets, addressing the gap between existing datasets and real-world research needs. It includes a 61k QA dataset (ScIRGen-Geo) and benchmarks current methods, revealing limitations in handling complex questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific QA datasets lack realism and fail to match the complexity of real-world research inquiries, limiting their utility for professional researchers.

Method: Developed ScIRGen, a framework with dataset-oriented information extraction, cognitive taxonomy-based question generation, and LLM perplexity-based answer filtering.

Result: Created ScIRGen-Geo, a 61k QA dataset. Benchmarked methods showed struggles with complex reasoning.

Conclusion: ScIRGen advances tools for scientific research by better aligning datasets with real-world information needs, though challenges remain in handling complex questions.

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

### [39] [SDMPrune: Self-Distillation MLP Pruning for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11120)
*Hourun Zhu, Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for compressing LLMs using self-distillation loss during pruning, focusing on MLP modules to reduce costs without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High deployment costs of LLMs and the need for efficient compression methods that retain generative capability.

Method: Introduces self-distillation loss during pruning to leverage original model predictions and focuses on pruning MLP modules for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing pruning methods on zero-shot benchmarks and achieves competitive performance among 1B-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively compresses LLMs while maintaining performance, with open-source code and weights available.

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

*Freddie Grabovski, Gilad Gressel, Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASRJam and EchoGuard are introduced as defenses against LLM-powered vishing scams by disrupting ASR transcription while preserving human call quality. EchoGuard, using natural distortions, outperforms other methods in usability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs, TTS, and ASR in scalable vishing scams poses a security threat, necessitating proactive defenses.

Method: ASRJam injects adversarial perturbations into audio to disrupt ASR, while EchoGuard leverages natural distortions like echo and reverberation.

Result: A 39-person study showed EchoGuard achieved the highest utility, balancing ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Conclusion: EchoGuard is an effective and practical defense against vishing scams, outperforming existing adversarial techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUIRoboTron-Speech is an end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that uses speech instructions and screenshots to predict actions, addressing limitations of text-based GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based GUI agents limit accessibility and convenience, especially in hands-free scenarios. Speech-based interaction is proposed as a solution.

Method: The system uses a TTS model to generate speech instructions from text, followed by progressive grounding and planning training stages. A heuristic mixed-instruction strategy addresses modality imbalance.

Result: Experiments show robust and superior performance, validating speech as an effective instruction modality for GUI agents.

Conclusion: GUIRoboTron-Speech demonstrates the potential of speech for GUI agents, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

### [42] [Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11128)
*Andrew Keenan Richardson, Ryan Othniel Kearns, Sean Moss, Vincent Wang-Mascianica, Philipp Koralus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: As language models improve, their reasoning errors increasingly mirror human fallacies, challenging the idea that scaling leads to normative rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns, including predictable fallacies, as they advance in capability.

Method: Applied the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) framework using PyETR to generate tasks where humans err predictably. Evaluated 38 models across 383 reasoning tasks.

Result: Advanced models showed more errors aligning with human fallacies (ρ = 0.360, p = 0.0265), independent of error rate.

Conclusion: Language models may converge toward human-like cognition, including biases, rather than achieving normative rationality.

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CHECK, a continuous-learning framework, reduces LLM hallucinations in healthcare from 31% to 0.3%, achieving state-of-the-art performance and scalability for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their clinical application, necessitating a reliable method to detect and mitigate them.

Method: CHECK integrates structured clinical databases with an information-theory-based classifier to detect factual and reasoning-based hallucinations.

Result: CHECK reduced hallucination rates to 0.3%, achieved AUCs of 0.95-0.96 on medical benchmarks, and improved GPT-4o's USMLE passing rate to 92.1%.

Conclusion: CHECK provides a scalable solution for safe LLM deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

### [44] [Large Language Models and Emergence: A Complex Systems Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11135)
*David C. Krakauer, John W. Krakauer, Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emergence in complexity science and applies it to Large Language Models (LLMs), questioning if they exhibit emergent intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emergent properties manifest in LLMs and whether they demonstrate intelligence as an emergent phenomenon.

Method: Examines claims of emergent capabilities in LLMs and reviews methods to quantify emergence.

Result: Discusses whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence, linking it to the efficiency of problem-solving.

Conclusion: Suggests that LLMs may exhibit emergent intelligence, aligning with the idea that 'less is more' in problem-solving efficiency.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for extracting and classifying medication discontinuations in EHR notes, finding GPT-4o and open-sourced models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct perform well, with few-shot learning enhancing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medication discontinuation data in EHRs is often buried in unstructured notes, posing patient safety risks. The study aims to assess LLMs' ability to extract and classify this information without human annotation.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs on three EHR datasets, testing medication extraction, discontinuation classification, and joint tasks. Explored zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting strategies.

Result: GPT-4o achieved the highest F1 scores (94.0% extraction, 78.1% classification, 72.7% joint task). Open-sourced models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct also performed well. Few-shot learning improved results, while CoT was inconsistent.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for EHR medication tasks, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives. Few-shot learning can further enhance performance.

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

*Shun Shao, Yftah Ziser, Zheng Zhao, Yifu Qiu, Shay B. Cohen, Anna Korhonen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IMSAE is a multilingual debiasing method that outperforms monolingual and cross-lingual approaches by identifying and mitigating joint bias subspaces across languages using iterative SVD-based truncation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods operate on individual languages, missing the opportunity to leverage multilingual representations for cross-language debiasing.

Method: Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure (IMSAE) uses iterative SVD-based truncation to identify and mitigate joint bias subspaces across multiple languages.

Result: IMSAE is effective across eight languages and five demographic dimensions, including zero-shot settings where target language data is unavailable. It outperforms traditional approaches while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: IMSAE successfully exploits multilingual representations for debiasing, offering a robust solution for cross-language bias mitigation.

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

*Kushagra Dixit, Abhishek Rajgaria, Harshavardhan Kalalbandi, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores prompting techniques for temporal table reasoning in LLMs, finding no single method consistently best. It introduces SEAR, an adaptive framework, which outperforms baselines and highlights the benefits of table refactoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting techniques for temporal table reasoning in LLMs lack exploration of their impact and optimality across diverse table types and contexts.

Method: Investigates multiple prompting techniques across table types, introduces SEAR (adaptive prompting framework), and examines table structure refactoring.

Result: Performance varies by entity type, table structure, context, and question complexity; SEAR outperforms baselines; unified table representation improves reasoning.

Conclusion: SEAR's adaptive approach and table refactoring enhance temporal table reasoning, addressing variability in performance across scenarios.

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

*Liran Ringel, Elad Tolochinsky, Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learning a dedicated continue-thinking token improves model accuracy more than fixed-token approaches in test-time scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if a learned continue-thinking token can outperform fixed tokens in extending reasoning steps and enhancing accuracy.

Method: Augment a distilled DeepSeek-R1 model with a learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping other weights frozen.

Result: The learned token achieves a 4.2% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, outperforming the fixed-token approach (1.3% improvement).

Conclusion: A learned continue-thinking token is more effective than fixed tokens for test-time scaling, significantly boosting model performance.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

*Yang Zhang, Amr Mohamed, Hadi Abdine, Guokan Shang, Michalis Vazirgiannis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curriculum learning in pretraining language models improves convergence and yields lasting gains, with compression ratio, lexical diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of curriculum learning in pretraining language models is underexplored, prompting a systematic investigation.

Method: Experiments with vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula guided by six difficulty metrics. Models were trained and evaluated on eight benchmarks.

Result: Curriculum learning improves early and mid-training convergence, with up to 3.5% improvement when used as a warmup strategy. Effective difficulty signals include compression ratio, lexical diversity, and readability.

Conclusion: Data ordering is crucial in large-scale pretraining, offering scalable and data-efficient model development insights.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

### [51] [Don't Pay Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11305)
*Mohammad Hammoud, Devang Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Avey, a new neural architecture, replaces Transformers and RNNs by decoupling sequence length from context width, enabling efficient processing of long sequences and outperforming Transformers in long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with fixed context windows and quadratic attention complexity, while RNNs lack parallelism. Avey aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Avey uses a ranker and autoregressive neural processor to identify and contextualize relevant tokens, decoupling sequence length from context width.

Result: Avey performs well on short-range NLP benchmarks and excels at capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: Avey offers a promising alternative to Transformers and RNNs, addressing their key limitations.

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

*Yi-Chien Lin, William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer models' surprisal estimates predict human reading times better with lower perplexity, and this trend also applies to brain imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if the relationship between Transformer model perplexity and surprisal predictive power extends beyond latency-based measures to neural data.

Method: Evaluated surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer models on two fMRI datasets across three language families.

Result: The positive relationship between model perplexity and predictive power holds for neural measures, generalizing the trend.

Conclusion: The trend of lower perplexity models being more predictive applies to brain imaging, not just reading times.

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

*Yaohui Zhang, Haijing Zhang, Wenlong Ji, Tianyu Hua, Nick Haber, Hancheng Cao, Weixin Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based peer review mechanism using pairwise comparisons outperforms traditional scoring but introduces biases like reduced novelty and institutional imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rethink peer review with LLMs beyond traditional workflows, exploring new paradigms for evaluating manuscript quality.

Method: Employ LLM agents for pairwise manuscript comparisons instead of individual scoring, aggregating results for robust quality assessment.

Result: The comparative approach outperforms rating-based methods in identifying high-impact papers but reveals biases in novelty and institutional representation.

Conclusion: LLMs hold transformative potential for peer review, but future systems must address biases to ensure equity and diversity.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

*Peilin Wu, Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A text-based approach for Speaker Diarization (SD) using sentence-level speaker change detection, outperforming audio-based methods in short conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-based SD systems struggle with audio quality and speaker similarity, prompting exploration of text-based alternatives.

Method: Developed two models: Single Prediction Model (SPM) and Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), using dialogue transcripts.

Result: Text-based SD, especially MPM, competes with audio-based systems, excelling in short conversations.

Conclusion: Linguistic features and semantic understanding enhance SD, suggesting future research in multimodal and semantic-based diarization.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to evaluate demographic biases in LLMs by analyzing their responses to moral scenarios, revealing baseline biases and tendencies of non-baseline demographics to help more.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating biases in LLMs is critical for fair and objective AI applications.

Method: Prompting models to assess moral patients' willingness to intervene, evaluating biases across genders, races, and ages.

Result: Models exhibit baseline biases favoring white middle-aged or young adult males, but non-baseline demographics show greater willingness to help.

Conclusion: The study provides tools to objectively assess and address biases in LLMs, aiding developers in creating fairer models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Motivation: Addressing poor generalization in RE due to excessive reliance on entities.

Method: Adapts a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework to compress entity-specific information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded solution for entity bias in RE.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across
general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test
sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity
replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and
theoretically grounded methodology.

*Karanpartap Singh, Neil Band, Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGLS is a compute-efficient pretraining framework that aligns model growth (progressive layer stacking) with increasing data difficulty, improving generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human cognitive development, the goal is to enhance learning efficiency in large language model pretraining by gradually increasing model complexity and data difficulty.

Method: CGLS involves progressive layer stacking (adding layers during training) and a curriculum-based data difficulty progression (e.g., from synthetic stories to technical content).

Result: CGLS outperforms baselines on benchmarks like PIQA and ARC at 100M parameters and improves generalization at the 1.2B scale.

Conclusion: CGLS effectively leverages progressive stacking and curriculum learning to enhance model performance on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Machine learning and LLMs were used to predict early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC), with fine-tuned LLMs showing 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising incidence of EoCRC in younger populations, who are not covered by standard screening guidelines, necessitates better predictive tools.

Method: Applied 10 machine learning models and compared them with advanced LLMs using patient data (conditions, lab results, observations) from 6 months prior to diagnosis. Analyzed 1,953 CRC patients from US health systems.

Result: Fine-tuned LLM achieved 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for EoCRC prediction, offering a potential tool for early detection in younger populations.

Abstract: The incidence rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC, age < 45) has
increased every year, but this population is younger than the recommended age
established by national guidelines for cancer screening. In this paper, we
applied 10 different machine learning models to predict EoCRC, and compared
their performance with advanced large language models (LLM), using patient
conditions, lab results, and observations within 6 months of patient journey
prior to the CRC diagnoses. We retrospectively identified 1,953 CRC patients
from multiple health systems across the United States. The results demonstrated
that the fine-tuned LLM achieved an average of 73% sensitivity and 91%
specificity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chelsea is a framework for online KV cache clustering in LLMs, reducing memory usage by 80% and speeding up inference by up to 3.19x with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLMs face deployment challenges due to high KV cache memory requirements, and existing solutions either discard critical information or lack efficiency.

Method: Chelsea uses chunked soft matching to cluster similar key states, merging KV cache into centroids within each cluster. Theoretical analysis supports the approach.

Result: Achieves up to 80% KV cache reduction, 3.19x faster decoding, and 2.72x lower latency while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Chelsea effectively addresses KV cache inefficiencies in LLMs with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

*Jeff Da, Clinton Wang, Xiang Deng, Yuntao Ma, Nikhil Barhate, Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR enhances RLVR for agentic tasks by introducing agent guidance, improving performance in complex environments like software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RLVR fails in agentic settings due to sparse rewards; Agent-RLVR addresses this by mimicking human pedagogy.

Method: Agent-RLVR uses agent guidance (strategic plans, feedback) to steer agents, validated by unit tests, and updates policies with RLVR.

Result: Pass@1 performance improved from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench, further boosted to 27.8% with test-time reward training.

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR enables effective RLVR in complex environments, paving the way for real-world applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system that competes with larger language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3.

Method: Fine-tuned NLLB models with special language tokens, evaluated using BLEU scores and an 'LLM as judge' method, and tested on social media datasets.

Result: KoGEC outperformed GPT-4 and HCX-3, showing balanced correction across error types, while larger LLMs neglected punctuation errors.

Conclusion: Compact, task-specific models like KoGEC can compete with general-purpose LLMs in specialized NLP tasks, contributing to the field with efficient solutions and new evaluation methods.

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform well on locating specific information (NIAH test) but struggle with detecting omitted information, as shown by AbsenceBench, achieving only 69.6% F1-score. Transformer attention mechanisms fail to handle 'gaps' in documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to detect missing information, highlighting a gap in their capabilities despite their proficiency in recalling existing data.

Method: Introduces AbsenceBench, testing LLMs on identifying deliberately removed information in numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests, using original and edited contexts.

Result: State-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score, indicating poor performance in detecting omissions.

Conclusion: Transformer attention mechanisms struggle with 'gaps,' revealing a fundamental limitation in LLMs for tasks involving missing information.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

### [63] [A Gamified Evaluation and Recruitment Platform for Low Resource Language Machine Translation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11467)
*Carlos Rafael Catalan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating low-resource language MT systems by proposing a gamified platform for recruiting human evaluators and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated metrics fail to capture nuances in low-resource language MT systems, and human evaluators are scarce.

Method: The paper reviews existing evaluation methods and designs a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform.

Result: A platform design is proposed to bridge the resource gap for MT system developers.

Conclusion: The platform could aid NLP research but faces evaluation challenges.

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

*Jaehoon Yun, Jiwoong Sohn, Jungwoo Park, Hyunjae Kim, Xiangru Tang, Yanjun Shao, Yonghoe Koo, Minhyeok Ko, Qingyu Chen, Mark Gerstein, Michael Moor, Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-PRM, a process reward modeling framework, improves clinical decision-making by verifying reasoning steps against medical knowledge, boosting model performance by up to 13.50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle to localize and correct reasoning errors in clinical decision-making, which is critical for accurate diagnosis and patient care.

Method: Med-PRM uses retrieval-augmented generation to verify intermediate reasoning steps against medical knowledge bases like clinical guidelines and literature.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on five medical QA benchmarks and two diagnostic tasks, with a 13.50% improvement over base models. Plug-and-play integration with models like Meerkat achieves over 80% accuracy on MedQA.

Conclusion: Med-PRM effectively addresses reasoning errors in clinical decision-making, demonstrating high performance and generality with small-scale models.

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility of language models in biomedical NLP, particularly their understanding of medical concepts like immunotherapy in breast cancer.

Method: Comparing the medical conceptual grounding of various language models against expert clinicians for identifying immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts.

Result: Pre-trained language models outperform large language models in identifying very specific (low-level) medical concepts.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models show promise for specialized medical NLP tasks, suggesting their potential over larger models for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,
to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has
grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

*Cole Gawin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BERT's relational understanding is not innate from pretraining but can be induced via fine-tuning, showing behavioral performance doesn't guarantee structured conceptual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if BERT's strong performance on semantic tasks reflects true conceptual competence or just surface-level statistical associations.

Method: Examined BERT's internal representations of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations, comparing pretrained and fine-tuned models.

Result: Pretrained BERT shows high classification accuracy but only organizes concept pairs by relation type after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Relational schemata in BERT are not emergent from pretraining alone but can be learned through task-specific training, indicating behavioral performance doesn't imply structured understanding.

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

### [67] [Lag-Relative Sparse Attention In Long Context Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11498)
*Manlai Liang, Wanyi Huang, Mandi Liu, Huaijun Li, Jinlong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA) with LagKV compression to improve LLMs' long-context handling without added parameters or high overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitations of LLMs in handling long-context input due to high computational costs and memory, and performance degradation from existing compression methods.

Method: Uses chunk-by-chunk prefilling with LagKV to select top K relevant key-value pairs in a fixed lagging window, focusing on salient context efficiently.

Result: Enhances LLM robustness with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned performance in question-answer tasks.

Conclusion: LRSA with LagKV offers an efficient solution for long-context post-training in LLMs, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

*Seongbo Jang, Seonghyeon Lee, Dongha Lee, Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal dialogue systems, proposing methods for response retrieval and comparing their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by enabling multimodal responses (text and image) and improving retrieval-based approaches.

Method: Proposes three integration methods: a two-step approach, an end-to-end approach, and a parameter sharing strategy.

Result: The end-to-end approach performs comparably to the two-step method, and parameter sharing improves efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of end-to-end learning and parameter sharing in multimodal dialogue systems.

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUDI improves personalized dialogue generation by using structured dialogue graphs and a novel graph encoder (DialogueGAT) to capture discourse relations and persona descriptions, enhancing response coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the naturalness and coherence of personalized responses in human-machine dialogue by addressing the challenges of maintaining consistency with user traits.

Method: Uses a Large Language Model to annotate discourse relations and structure dialogue data into graphs. DialogueGAT encodes these graphs, and coherence-aware attention strategies improve response generation.

Result: Significant improvements in personalized response quality, making dialogues more human-like.

Conclusion: MUDI effectively leverages discourse relations and persona descriptions to generate coherent and personalized responses, advancing dialogue generation.

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

*Hawau Olamide Toyin, Samar M. Magdy, Hanan Aldarmaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform specialized models in Arabic and Yoruba diacritization, but smaller models hallucinate. Fine-tuning improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' effectiveness for text diacritization in Arabic and Yoruba and compare them with specialized models.

Method: Evaluated 14 LLMs and 6 specialized models, introduced MultiDiac dataset, and fine-tuned small models using LoRA for Yoruba.

Result: LLMs outperformed specialized models, but smaller models had hallucinations. Fine-tuning reduced hallucinations and improved performance.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for diacritization, and fine-tuning small models can enhance their performance.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

*Simeon Junker, Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneGram, a dataset for studying how scene context affects human conceptualization of objects, and compares human variability in naming to multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scene context influences human conceptualization and naming of objects, and to evaluate how well multimodal LLMs capture this variability.

Method: Created SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes in various scenes, and analyzed references from multimodal LLMs.

Result: Human references show rich variability in conceptualization, while multimodal LLMs fail to capture this diversity.

Conclusion: Scene context significantly shapes human conceptualization, but current multimodal LLMs lack the ability to replicate this variability.

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

TL;DR: LoRA-Gen framework uses a cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models, improving efficiency and performance without specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in effectiveness and efficiency of scaling language models for domain-specific tasks, especially for small edge-side models.

Method: Utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models via reparameterization, reducing input context length.

Result: Outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning with competitive accuracy, 2.1x speedup, and 10.1x compression ratio.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen enables efficient knowledge transfer and specialization for edge-side models, enhancing performance and inference speed.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scarcity of annotated CRF datasets by converting existing datasets into structured CRFs, proposing a semi-automatic methodology and evaluating slot filling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Publicly available, well-annotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the development of CRF slot filling systems.

Method: A semi-automatic conversion methodology is applied to the E3C dataset in English and Italian to create a structured CRF dataset.

Result: Slot filling achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English with LLMs, showing the challenge even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulty of CRF slot filling and releases a new dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amnesic probing assesses model behavior by removing specific linguistic info. INLP introduces random changes, while MP and LEACE offer more targeted removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision of information removal in amnesic probing for better behavioral explanations.

Method: Proposes Mean Projection (MP) and LEACE as alternatives to INLP for targeted info removal.

Result: MP and LEACE remove info more precisely than INLP, enhancing amnesic probing's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MP and LEACE outperform INLP in targeted info removal, improving behavioral analysis.

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transform complex sentences into simplified sequences while maintaining semantic and logical integrity, especially for video game design.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is more effective for sentence simplification in video game design applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of transforming complex sentences into

TL;DR: The paper introduces Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a framework for dynamic AI behavior adjustment based on human-interpretable directives, overcoming static preference limitations in models like DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment models assume static preferences, limiting adaptability. CPT aims to enable dynamic behavior adjustment for nuanced, context-dependent feedback.

Method: CPT uses synthetically generated preference data conditioned on system prompts from fine-grained rubrics, fine-tuning LLMs to adjust outputs at inference without retraining.

Result: CPT provides fine-grained control and nuanced feedback modeling, with experimental artifacts (code, datasets, models) released.

Conclusion: CPT enhances AI adaptability and control, offering a scalable solution for dynamic preference alignment.

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting traditional high-performance matrix multiplication (gemm) to mixed-precision integer arithmetic for modern ISAs, showing performance gains over floating-point methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift toward reduced-precision formats in deep learning (DL) and scientific computing necessitates revisiting gemm optimization to leverage modern hardware capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces novel micro-kernel designs and data layouts tailored for mixed-precision integer arithmetic across x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Result: Demonstrated significant performance improvements using mixed-precision integer arithmetic over traditional floating-point implementations.

Conclusion: The work marks a new era in gemm optimization, driven by DL inference demands, termed the 'Cambrian period' for matrix multiplication.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Nan Jiang, Ziming Wu, De-Chuan Zhan, Fuming Lai, Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART is a self-distillation framework that replaces autoregressive Chain-of-Thought reasoning with non-autoregressive Silent Thought for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive CoT reasoning in LLMs causes computational overhead, limiting use in latency-sensitive applications.

Method: DART uses two pathways: CoT for traditional reasoning and ST for direct answer generation via evolving tokens. A Reasoning Evolvement Module aligns ST with CoT.

Result: DART matches baseline reasoning performance while significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: DART is a feasible, efficient alternative to autoregressive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepResearch Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating Deep Research Agents (DRAs), featuring 100 PhD-level tasks across 22 fields, with two novel evaluation methods aligning with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a systematic benchmark for evaluating DRAs, which transform online information into high-quality reports, motivated the creation of DeepResearch Bench.

Method: Two methodologies are proposed: a reference-based method for report quality assessment and a framework for evaluating retrieval and citation accuracy.

Result: DeepResearch Bench and evaluation frameworks are open-sourced to advance LLM-based agent development.

Conclusion: The benchmark and methodologies aim to standardize and accelerate the evaluation and improvement of DRAs.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-context modeling due to fixed context windows, and length generalization is a key challenge.

Method: The study shifts focus to output distribution consistency, introduces Long-Short Misalignment metric, and develops a regularization term for training.

Result: Experiments show the approach improves length generalization, correlating strongly with the proposed metric.

Conclusion: The work provides new insights for better long-context modeling in LLMs, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

### [81] [Persona-driven Simulation of Voting Behavior in the European Parliament with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11798)
*Maximilian Kreutner, Marlene Lutz, Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether zero-shot persona prompting in LLMs can predict individual voting decisions and aggregate policy positions of European groups, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.793 for simulating MEP voting behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit progressive left-leaning biases, and persona prompts can align them with unaligned socioeconomic groups. This work explores if such prompts can predict voting behavior and policy positions.

Method: Zero-shot persona prompting with limited information is used to predict voting decisions and policy positions, tested for stability against counterfactual arguments, different prompts, and generation methods.

Result: The method achieves a weighted F1 score of ~0.793 for simulating MEP voting behavior, demonstrating reasonable accuracy.

Conclusion: Zero-shot persona prompting can effectively simulate voting behavior and predict policy positions, with potential applications in political analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in resolving references using abstract visual stimuli like color patches and grids, revealing challenges in pragmatic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the pragmatic abilities of MLLMs in handling context-dependent interpretations of simple visual stimuli, a task straightforward for humans but revealing for models.

Method: Investigation of MLLMs' performance in reference resolution tasks involving abstract visual stimuli (color patches and grids).

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic pragmatic capabilities, such as context-dependent color interpretation.

Conclusion: Despite advancements, MLLMs face significant challenges in pragmatic tasks, highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

*Yi-Pei Chen, Noriki Nishida, Hideki Nakayama, Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPA is a two-stage framework for multi-session dialogue generation that first generates a general response, then aligns it with persona memories, improving consistency, diversity, and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods retrieve persona information before response generation, limiting diversity and producing generic outputs. PPA addresses this by reversing the process.

Method: PPA generates a general response from dialogue context, retrieves relevant persona memories using the response as a query, and refines the response to align with the persona.

Result: PPA outperforms prior methods in consistency, diversity, and persona relevance on multi-session dialogue data.

Conclusion: PPA offers a flexible and effective paradigm for long-term personalized dialogue generation.

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

TL;DR: FourierAttention reduces KV cache memory demands in large language models by leveraging heterogeneous head dimensions and Fourier projections, achieving top accuracy in long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of existing KV cache compression methods that homogenize head dimensions or prune tokens, often at the cost of accuracy or computational overhead.

Method: Uses FourierAttention to project long-context-insensitive dimensions onto Fourier bases, approximating their temporal evolution with spectral coefficients. Includes FlashFourierAttention, a Triton kernel for optimized memory usage.

Result: Achieves best long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) for LLaMA models, with efficient deployment.

Conclusion: FourierAttention offers a training-free, accurate, and efficient solution for managing KV cache memory in large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Motivation: To enhance German language processing by leveraging updated architectures and tailored datasets.

Method: Incremental training on a German corpus using Whole Word Masking, extended-input variants with Nyströmformer and Longformer for long sequences.

Result: Strong performance in NER and text classification, outperforming larger models and setting new SOTA.

Conclusion: GeistBERT advances German NLP and is released to support the research community.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Motivation: To address the challenge of defining criteria for assessing counter-speech effectiveness against hate speech.

Method: Proposes a framework with six dimensions (Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience Adaptation, Fairness) and two classification strategies (multi-task and dependency-based).

Result: Achieved strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1) on expert- and user-written counter-speech, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively classifies counter-speech effectiveness, revealing interdependencies among dimensions.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task

### [87] [Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11930)
*Dongwei Jiang, Alvin Zhang, Andrew Wang, Nicholas Andrews, Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to fully integrate near-perfect feedback, termed FEEDBACK FRICTION, despite controlled experiments and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how effectively LLMs can incorporate extrinsic feedback under ideal conditions.

Method: Controlled experiments with solver models and feedback generators across diverse tasks, using state-of-the-art models like Claude 3.7.

Result: Models resist feedback (FEEDBACK FRICTION), even with mitigation strategies like temperature increases and answer rejection.

Conclusion: Highlighting FEEDBACK FRICTION and ruling out causes aids future research in LLM self-improvement.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

TL;DR: A defense framework using contrastive representation learning (CRL) to improve LLM robustness against adversarial attacks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and current defenses lack generalization across attack types.

Method: Finetunes models with triplet-based loss and adversarial hard negative mining to separate benign and harmful representations.

Result: Outperforms prior defenses, improving robustness against input-level and embedding-space attacks without standard performance loss.

Conclusion: The proposed CRL-based framework effectively enhances LLM defense against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs influence code style, analyzing trends in naming conventions, complexity, and maintainability across 19,000 GitHub repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of LLMs on coding practices, particularly in naming conventions, complexity, and maintainability.

Method: Analyzed code from 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers (2020-2025), focusing on measurable trends like naming conventions.

Result: Found trends aligning with LLM-generated code, e.g., snake_case usage in Python rose from 47% to 51% (2023-2025).

Conclusion: LLMs significantly influence real-world coding style, though precise estimation of their impact remains challenging.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlashBack improves RALM efficiency by appending retrieved documents and using Marking Tokens, achieving 4x faster inference while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prepending retrieved content in RALM degrades efficiency due to KV cache misuse. FlashBack addresses this by appending content.

Method: FlashBack appends documents and uses Marking Tokens for boundary marking, optimized via Low-Rank Adaption.

Result: FlashBack maintains generation quality (perplexity) and achieves 4x faster inference on a 7B LLM.

Conclusion: FlashBack significantly boosts inference speed and reduces cost, advancing RALM efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (RALM) by integrating large language
models (LLM) with relevant documents from an external corpus is a proven method
for enabling the LLM to generate information beyond the scope of its
pre-training corpus. Previous work utilizing retrieved content by simply
prepending it to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the
inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV)
cache efficiently. In this paper, we propose FlashBack, a modular RALM designed
to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern
while maintaining decent performance after fine-tuning by Low-Rank Adaption.
FlashBack appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently
utilizing the KV cache instead of prepending them. And we introduce Marking
Token as two special prompt tokens for marking the boundary of the appending
context during fine-tuning. Our experiments on testing generation quality show
that FlashBack can remain decent generation quality in perplexity. And the
inference speed of FlashBack is up to $4\times$ faster than the prepending
counterpart on a 7B LLM (Llama 2) in the runtime test. Via bypassing
unnecessary re-computation, it demonstrates an advancement by achieving
significantly faster inference speed, and this heightened efficiency will
substantially reduce inferential cost.

TL;DR: The study investigates social biases in Japanese LLMs using the JBBQ dataset, finding that larger models improve accuracy but increase bias scores. Mitigation techniques like warnings and chain-of-thought prompting help but need further refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social biases in LLMs are a critical issue, but Japanese LLMs lack thorough investigation. This study aims to fill that gap by analyzing biases in Japanese LLMs.

Method: Constructed the Japanese Bias Benchmark dataset for Question Answering (JBBQ) based on the English BBQ benchmark. Evaluated biases in Japanese LLMs using this dataset.

Result: Larger Japanese LLMs show higher accuracy but increased bias scores. Warnings and chain-of-thought prompting reduce biases but struggle with extracting correct evidence in Japanese.

Conclusion: The JBBQ dataset highlights biases in Japanese LLMs and suggests mitigation techniques, though further improvements are needed for better evidence extraction.

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), social biases in these
LLMs have become a pressing issue. Although there are various benchmarks for
social biases across languages, the extent to which Japanese LLMs exhibit
social biases has not been fully investigated. In this study, we construct the
Japanese Bias Benchmark dataset for Question Answering (JBBQ) based on the
English bias benchmark BBQ, with analysis of social biases in Japanese LLMs.
The results show that while current open Japanese LLMs with more parameters
show improved accuracies on JBBQ, their bias scores increase. In addition,
prompts with a warning about social biases and chain-of-thought prompting
reduce the effect of biases in model outputs, but there is room for improvement
in extracting the correct evidence from contexts in Japanese. Our dataset is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs spreading unethical content, particularly implicit bias, by rigorously evaluating their bias toward certain demographics.

Method: Proposes three attack approaches (Disguise, Deception, Teaching) and builds two benchmarks: a bilingual dataset (2.7K instances) and BUMBLE (12.7K instances).

Result: Demonstrates that the methods effectively elicit LLMs' inner bias, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The attack methodology and benchmarks provide tools to assess LLMs' ethical risks, promoting accountability in development.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become an important way of information
access, there have been increasing concerns that LLMs may intensify the spread
of unethical content, including implicit bias that hurts certain populations
without explicit harmful words. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation
of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a
psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by
psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three
attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the
corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual
dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for
extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning
nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation.
Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our
methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive
baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of
assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater
accountability in their development. Our code, data, and benchmarks are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decision-making in large language models is crucial due to their widespread use, requiring methods that capture dynamic transformations across layers.

Method: Introduces topological descriptors using zigzag persistence to track the evolution of topological features (e.g., p-dimensional holes) across model layers, providing a system-level view.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's expressivity by showing sensitivity to models and datasets, and applies it to layer pruning, matching state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel, integrated perspective on model behavior, enabling practical applications like layer pruning while maintaining system-level insights.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of large language models is
critical given their widespread applications. To achieve this, we aim to
connect a formal mathematical framework - zigzag persistence from topological
data analysis - with practical and easily applicable algorithms. Zigzag
persistence is particularly effective for characterizing data as it dynamically
transforms across model layers. Within this framework, we introduce topological
descriptors that measure how topological features, $p$-dimensional holes,
persist and evolve throughout the layers. Unlike methods that assess each layer
individually and then aggregate the results, our approach directly tracks the
full evolutionary path of these features. This offers a statistical perspective
on how prompts are rearranged and their relative positions changed in the
representation space, providing insights into the system's operation as an
integrated whole. To demonstrate the expressivity and applicability of our
framework, we highlight how sensitive these descriptors are to different models
and a variety of datasets. As a showcase application to a downstream task, we
use zigzag persistence to establish a criterion for layer pruning, achieving
results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preserving the
system-level perspective.

Conclusion: TrajAgent effectively automates trajectory modeling, outperforming existing methods and addressing key challenges.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern
mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life
services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods
have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling.
However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make

\textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs),
designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through
automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized
models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets
effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an
execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the
execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we
introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across
various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative
learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to
enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive
experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving
a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.

TL;DR: A novel probabilistic KGC framework combines sparse latent feature models with a deep VAE to integrate global clustering and local textual features, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based KGC methods often fail to fully leverage global structural properties of knowledge graphs, prompting the need for a more integrated approach.

Method: The proposed method uses stochastic blockmodels (SBMs) and a latent feature relational model (LFRM), optimized via a deep VAE, to dynamically combine global clustering with local textual features.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively completes missing triples while enhancing interpretability of latent structures in knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge graph completion (KGC) have emphasized
text-based approaches to navigate the inherent complexities of large-scale
knowledge graphs (KGs). While these methods have achieved notable progress,
they frequently struggle to fully incorporate the global structural properties
of the graph. Stochastic blockmodels (SBMs), especially the latent feature
relational model (LFRM), offer robust probabilistic frameworks for identifying
latent community structures and improving link prediction. This paper presents
a novel probabilistic KGC framework utilizing sparse latent feature models,
optimized via a deep variational autoencoder (VAE). Our proposed method
dynamically integrates global clustering information with local textual
features to effectively complete missing triples, while also providing enhanced
interpretability of the underlying latent structures. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets with varying scales demonstrate the significant
performance gains achieved by our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mapping services struggle with natural language geospatial queries, and creating reliable QA datasets is challenging.

Method: MapQaTor integrates with maps APIs, caches responses for consistency, and centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization.

Result: The framework speeds up annotation by 30x compared to manual methods and enhances geospatial dataset reliability.

Conclusion: MapQaTor advances geospatial understanding and offers a scalable solution for developing complex map reasoning datasets.

Abstract: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap,
are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often
struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in
Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but

### [97] [Women, Infamous, and Exotic Beings: What Honorific Usages in Wikipedia Reflect on the Cross-Cultural Sociolinguistic Norms?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03479)
*Sourabrata Mukherjee, Atharva Mehta, Soumya Teotia, Sougata Saha, Akhil Arora, Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes honorific usage in Hindi and Bengali Wikipedia, revealing inconsistencies and biases, and calls for language-specific editorial guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored consistency of honorific usage in honorific-rich languages like Hindi and Bengali on Wikipedia, given its cultural and social significance.

Method: Large-scale analysis of 10,000 articles per language using LLMs to annotate honorific usage and socio-demographic features (gender, age, fame, cultural origin).

Result: Honorific usage is more common in Bengali than Hindi, with biases observed (e.g., gender bias in Hindi favoring men). Non-honorific forms are frequent for infamous, juvenile, and exotic entities.

Conclusion: Wikipedia needs language-specific editorial guidelines for honorific usage to address inconsistencies and biases.

Abstract: Wikipedia, as a massively multilingual, community-driven platform, is a
valuable resource for Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet the consistency of
honorific usage in honorific-rich languages remains underexplored. Honorifics,
subtle yet profound linguistic markers, encode social hierarchies, politeness
norms, and cultural values, but Wikipedia's editorial guidelines lack clear
standards for their usage in languages where such forms are grammatically and
socially prevalent. This paper addresses this gap through a large-scale
analysis of third-person honorific pronouns and verb forms in Hindi and Bengali
Wikipedia articles. Using Large Language Models (LLM), we automatically
annotate 10,000 articles per language for honorific usage and socio-demographic
features such as gender, age, fame, and cultural origin. We investigate: (i)
the consistency of honorific usage across articles, (ii) how inconsistencies
correlate with socio-cultural factors, and (iii) the presence of explicit or
implicit biases across languages. We find that honorific usage is consistently
more common in Bengali than Hindi, while non-honorific forms are more frequent
for infamous, juvenile, and exotic entities in both. Notably, gender bias
emerges in both languages, particularly in Hindi, where men are more likely to
receive honorifics than women. Our analysis highlights the need for Wikipedia
to develop language-specific editorial guidelines for honorific usage.

*Hichem Ammar Khodja, Frédéric Béchet, Quentin Brabant, Alexis Nasr, Gwénolé Lecorvé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates language models' ability to handle temporal context in factual knowledge, revealing significant limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether language models can accurately associate temporal contexts with facts and identify incorrect contexts.

Method: Introduces the TimeStress dataset to evaluate 18 diverse LMs, analyzing their performance based on context distance and granularity.

Result: The best LM achieved perfect distinction for only 11% of facts, with rare but critical errors humans wouldn't make.

Conclusion: Current LMs have notable limitations in temporal representation, as highlighted by their performance on the TimeStress dataset.

Abstract: This paper explores the robustness of language models (LMs) to variations in
the temporal context within factual knowledge. It examines whether LMs can
correctly associate a temporal context with a past fact valid over a defined
period, by asking them to differentiate correct from incorrect contexts. The
LMs' ability to distinguish is analyzed along two dimensions: the distance of
the incorrect context from the validity period and the granularity of the
context. To this end, a dataset called TimeStress is introduced, enabling the
evaluation of 18 diverse LMs. Results reveal that the best LM achieves a
perfect distinction for only 11% of the studied facts, with errors, certainly
rare, but critical that humans would not make. This work highlights the
limitations of current LMs in temporal representation.

*Avery Ma, Yangchen Pan, Amir-massoud Farahmand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PANDAS improves many-shot jailbreaking in LLMs by enhancing fabricated dialogues with positive affirmations, negative demonstrations, and adaptive sampling, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in LLMs' long-context processing by exploiting fabricated dialogues for harmful instructions.

Method: Hybrid technique (PANDAS) modifies dialogues with positive affirmations, negative demonstrations, and adaptive sampling, tested on ManyHarm dataset.

Result: PANDAS significantly outperforms baseline methods in long-context scenarios, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: PANDAS effectively exploits long-context vulnerabilities, improving many-shot jailbreaking and providing insights into LLM safety.

Abstract: Many-shot jailbreaking circumvents the safety alignment of LLMs by exploiting
their ability to process long input sequences. To achieve this, the malicious
target prompt is prefixed with hundreds of fabricated conversational exchanges
between the user and the model. These exchanges are randomly sampled from a
pool of unsafe question-answer pairs, making it appear as though the model has
already complied with harmful instructions. In this paper, we present PANDAS: a
hybrid technique that improves many-shot jailbreaking by modifying these
fabricated dialogues with Positive Affirmations, Negative Demonstrations, and
an optimized Adaptive Sampling method tailored to the target prompt's topic. We
also introduce ManyHarm, a dataset of harmful question-answer pairs, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that PANDAS significantly outperforms
baseline methods in long-context scenarios. Through attention analysis, we
provide insights into how long-context vulnerabilities are exploited and show
how PANDAS further improves upon many-shot jailbreaking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TUMLU and TUMLU-mini, native-language MMLU benchmarks for Turkic languages, addressing gaps in evaluation datasets and assessing multilingual LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMLU benchmarks often rely on machine translation, which may introduce errors and overlook linguistic/cultural nuances, especially for underrepresented Turkic languages.

Method: Developed natively crafted benchmarks (TUMLU and TUMLU-mini) for Turkic languages, covering 11 subjects, and evaluated multilingual LLMs like Claude, Gemini, GPT, and LLaMA.

Result: Provided a systematic evaluation of LLMs across Turkic languages, subjects, and alphabets, highlighting performance variations.

Conclusion: The benchmarks fill a critical gap in MMLU evaluation for Turkic languages, promoting further research in multilingual language understanding.

Abstract: Being able to thoroughly assess massive multi-task language understanding
(MMLU) capabilities is essential for advancing the applicability of
multilingual language models. However, preparing such benchmarks in high
quality native language is often costly and therefore limits the
representativeness of evaluation datasets. While recent efforts focused on
building more inclusive MMLU benchmarks, these are conventionally built using
machine translation from high-resource languages, which may introduce errors
and fail to account for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of the target
languages. In this paper, we address the lack of native language MMLU benchmark
especially in the under-represented Turkic language family with distinct
morphosyntactic and cultural characteristics. We propose two benchmarks for
Turkic language MMLU: TUMLU is a comprehensive, multilingual, and natively
developed language understanding benchmark specifically designed for Turkic
languages. It consists of middle- and high-school level questions spanning 11
academic subjects in Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Tatar,
Turkish, Uyghur, and Uzbek. We also present TUMLU-mini, a more concise,
balanced, and manually verified subset of the dataset. Using this dataset, we
systematically evaluate a diverse range of open and proprietary multilingual
large language models (LLMs), including Claude, Gemini, GPT, and LLaMA,
offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across different languages,
subjects, and alphabets. To promote further research and development in
multilingual language understanding, we release TUMLU-mini and all
corresponding evaluation scripts.

*Xu Wang, Yan Hu, Wenyu Du, Reynold Cheng, Benyou Wang, Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes fine-tuning in LLMs using circuit analysis, revealing significant edge changes in circuits and proposing a circuit-aware LoRA method for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms of fine-tuning in LLMs, especially in tasks where pre-trained models perform poorly, using circuit analysis.

Method: Develops mathematical tasks for fine-tuning, identifies circuits at checkpoints, and introduces a circuit-aware LoRA method based on edge changes.

Result: Circuit-aware LoRA improves performance by 2.46% over standard LoRA, and insights into compositional tasks are provided.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of fine-tuning dynamics and offers practical improvements for adaptation methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This paper aims
to provide an in-depth interpretation of the fine-tuning process through
circuit analysis, a popular tool in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). Unlike
previous studies (Prakash et al. 2024; Chhabra et al. 2024) that focus on tasks
where pre-trained models already perform well, we develop a set of mathematical
tasks where fine-tuning yields substantial performance gains, which are closer
to the practical setting. In our experiments, we identify circuits at various
checkpoints during fine-tuning and examine the interplay between circuit
analysis, fine-tuning methods, and task complexities. First, we find that while
circuits maintain high node similarity before and after fine-tuning, their
edges undergo significant changes, in contrast to prior work that shows
circuits only add some additional components after fine-tuning. Based on these
observations, we develop a circuit-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method,
which assigns ranks to layers based on edge changes in the circuits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our circuit-based LoRA algorithm achieves
an average performance improvement of 2.46% over standard LoRA with similar
parameter sizes. Furthermore, we explore how combining circuits from subtasks
can enhance fine-tuning in compositional tasks, providing new insights into the
design of such tasks and deepening the understanding of circuit dynamics and
fine-tuning mechanisms.

### [102] [Conformal Linguistic Calibration: Trading-off between Factuality and Specificity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19110)
*Zhengping Jiang, Anqi Liu, Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), a unified approach combining abstention and linguistic calibration to improve model reliability by controlling response imprecision and ensuring factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model outputs are unreliable, and existing methods like abstention and linguistic calibration have limitations—abstention withholds information, while linguistic calibration is hard to use downstream.

Method: CLC reinterprets linguistic calibration as answer set prediction, connects abstention and calibration via linguistic pragmatics, and implements a framework for controlling response imprecision.

Result: CLC produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy and enables uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting.

Conclusion: CLC offers a controllable balance between factuality and specificity, improving model reliability and downstream utility.

Abstract: Language model outputs are not always reliable, thus prompting research into
how to adapt model responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include:
\emph{abstention}, where models refrain from generating responses when
uncertain; and \emph{linguistic calibration}, where models hedge their
statements using uncertainty quantifiers. However, abstention can withhold
valuable information, while linguistically calibrated responses are often
challenging to leverage in downstream tasks. We propose a unified view,
Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), which reinterprets linguistic
calibration as \emph{answer set prediction}. First we present a framework
connecting abstention and linguistic calibration through the lens of linguistic
pragmatics. We then describe an implementation of CLC that allows for
controlling the level of imprecision in model responses. Results demonstrate
our method produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual
accuracy. Further, our approach enables fine-tuning models to perform
uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, offering a controllable balance
between factuality and specificity.

*Daniel Rose, Chia-Chien Hung, Marco Lepri, Israa Alqassem, Kiril Gashteovski, Carolin Lawrence*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDDxAgent is a modular framework for interactive differential diagnosis (DDx), improving accuracy and explainability by iteratively refining diagnoses without assuming complete patient profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDx approaches using LLMs have limitations like single-dataset evaluations, unrealistic assumptions, and lack of iterative refinement.

Method: MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: an orchestrator (DDxDriver), a history-taking simulator, and specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy.

Result: MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvement in interactive DDx across LLMs and provides explainable diagnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of iterative refinement and modular design for robust and explainable DDx.

Abstract: Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical
decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of
possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While
recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including
single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic
assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We
introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for
interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning,
rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent
integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a
history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge
retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a
comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We
analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of
iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our
broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy
improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while
offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.

*Varshini Reddy, Craig W. Schmidt, Yuval Pinter, Chris Tanner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of tokenizer training data size on tokenization quality, finding diminishing returns beyond ~150GB for English and ~200GB for Russian, due to pre-tokenization constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how tokenizer training data size affects tokenization quality and identify practical limits for efficiency.

Method: Train BPE, UnigramLM, and WordPiece tokenizers with varying vocabulary sizes on English (1GB-900GB) and Russian data.

Result: Diminishing returns occur beyond ~150GB (English) and ~200GB (Russian), attributed to pre-tokenization constraints.

Conclusion: Optimizing tokenization by limiting training data size can reduce compute costs, with implications for future tokenization algorithm research.

Abstract: Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is
governed by several key parameters, such as the tokenization algorithm,
vocabulary size, pre-tokenization strategy, inference strategy, and training
data corpus. This paper investigates the impact of an often-overlooked
hyperparameter, tokenizer training data size. We train BPE, UnigramLM, and
WordPiece tokenizers across various vocabulary sizes using English training
data ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as
training data size increases beyond roughly 150GB, suggesting a practical limit
to the improvements in tokenization quality achievable through additional data.
We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to constraints
introduced by the pre-tokenization stage. We then demonstrate the extent to
which these findings can generalize by experimenting on data in Russian, a
language typologically distant from English. For Russian text, we observe
diminishing returns after training a tokenizer from 200GB of data, which is
approximately 33% more than when training on English. These results provide
valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process by reducing the
compute required for training on large corpora and suggest promising directions
for future research in tokenization algorithms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PFDial dataset for process-driven dialogue tasks, showing that smaller models trained on it outperform larger models like GPT-4 in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process-driven dialogue systems are crucial but challenging for LLMs due to strict constraints. The PFDial dataset aims to address this gap.

Method: The dataset is built from 440 flowcharts converted into structured five-tuples. Models (7B and 0.5B) are trained on this data.

Result: Smaller models achieve over 90% accuracy, with the 8B model outperforming GPT-4 by up to 43.88%.

Conclusion: The PFDial dataset effectively improves model performance in constrained dialogue tasks, with insights on dataset formats and backward transitions.

Abstract: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined
process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment
maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve
these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we
construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705
high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts
containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML
flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples.
Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800
samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy.
Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of
11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward
transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various
dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling
decision and sequential branches. The data is released in

*Hongyu Chen, Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs as safety evaluators are unreliable due to biases, input artifacts, and inconsistency with human judgments. Jury-based evaluations improve robustness but don't fully resolve artifact sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of LLMs as automated evaluators for content safety, given their growing use despite uncertain reliability.

Method: Evaluated 11 LLM judge models across safety domains, testing self-consistency, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts.

Result: LLM biases distort safety verdicts; apologetic language skews evaluations by up to 98%. Larger models aren't consistently more robust. Jury-based evaluations improve robustness but not artifact sensitivity.

Conclusion: Diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies are urgently needed for reliable safety assessments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated
evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in
this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge
models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects:
self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and
susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our
findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final
verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of
comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew
evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do
not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes
show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator
robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions
from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and
enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with
the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for
diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety
assessments.

TL;DR: LLaVA-CMoE is a continual learning framework for LLMs that avoids replay data, ensures parameter efficiency, and prevents catastrophic forgetting using probe-guided knowledge extension and probabilistic task locators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in extending MoE architectures for sequential tasks without rapid parameter growth or catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Introduces Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension and Probabilistic Task Locator with VAE-based reconstruction for expert allocation.

Result: Demonstrates strong continual learning performance on the CoIN benchmark with reduced forgetting and parameter overhead.

Conclusion: LLaVA-CMoE is effective and scalable for parameter-efficient continual learning in large language models.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have recently advanced the scalability
and adaptability of large language models (LLMs) for continual multimodal
learning. However, efficiently extending these models to accommodate sequential
tasks remains challenging. As new tasks arrive, naive model expansion leads to
rapid parameter growth, while modifying shared routing components often causes
catastrophic forgetting, undermining previously learned knowledge. To address
these issues, we propose LLaVA-CMoE, a continual learning framework for LLMs
that requires no replay data of previous tasks and ensures both parameter
efficiency and robust knowledge retention. Our approach introduces a
Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension mechanism, which uses probe experts to
dynamically determine when and where new experts should be added, enabling
adaptive and minimal parameter expansion tailored to task complexity.
Furthermore, we present a Probabilistic Task Locator that assigns each task a
dedicated, lightweight router. To handle the practical issue that task labels
are unknown during inference, we leverage a VAE-based reconstruction strategy
to identify the most suitable router by matching input distributions, allowing
automatic and accurate expert allocation. This design mitigates routing
conflicts and catastrophic forgetting, enabling robust continual learning
without explicit task labels. Extensive experiments on the CoIN benchmark,
covering eight diverse VQA tasks, demonstrate that LLaVA-CMoE delivers strong
continual learning performance with a compact model size, significantly
reducing forgetting and parameter overhead compared to prior methods. These
results showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our approach for
parameter-efficient continual learning in large language models. Our code will
be open-sourced soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs simulate human behavior for surveys, but unclear if responses reflect in-group or out-group perspectives. A new method creates detailed virtual personas, improving human-like responses by 87%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs provide deep (in-group) or shallow (out-group) responses and enhance their use in political science studies.

Method: Proposes a novel methodology for generating detailed, consistent virtual personas with synthetic backstories.

Result: Virtual personas replicate human responses closely (87% improvement) and match effect sizes of in-group/out-group biases.

Conclusion: Extends LLM applicability beyond socially understood responses, enabling broader human studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of simulating human
behavior, offering cost-effective ways to estimate user responses to various
surveys and polls. However, the questions in these surveys usually reflect
socially understood attitudes: the patterns of attitudes of old/young,
liberal/conservative, as understood by both members and non-members of those
groups. It is not clear whether the LLM binding is \emph{deep}, meaning the LLM
answers as a member of a particular in-group would, or \emph{shallow}, meaning
the LLM responds as an out-group member believes an in-group member would. To
explore this difference, we use questions that expose known in-group/out-group
biases. This level of fidelity is critical for applying LLMs to various
political science studies, including timely topics on polarization dynamics,
inter-group conflict, and democratic backsliding. To this end, we propose a
novel methodology for constructing virtual personas with synthetic user
``backstories" generated as extended, multi-turn interview transcripts. Our
generated backstories are longer, rich in detail, and consistent in
authentically describing a singular individual, compared to previous methods.
We show that virtual personas conditioned on our backstories closely replicate
human response distributions (up to an 87\% improvement as measured by
Wasserstein Distance) and produce effect sizes that closely match those
observed in the original studies of in-group/out-group biases. Altogether, our
work extends the applicability of LLMs beyond estimating socially understood
responses, enabling their use in a broader range of human studies.

TL;DR: D-GEN is an open-source model for generating high-quality distractors in multiple-choice evaluations, with automated quality assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in evaluating generative models due to inconsistent response formats and labor-intensive distractor generation.

Method: Introduces D-GEN to transform open-ended data into MC format, with ranking alignment and entropy analysis for quality evaluation.

Result: D-GEN achieves high ranking consistency (Spearman's rho 0.99, Kendall's tau 0.94) and matches ground-truth entropy distribution. Human evaluation confirms quality.

Conclusion: D-GEN advances robust and efficient distractor generation, improving MC evaluation standards.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models with open-ended generation is challenging due to
inconsistencies in response formats. Multiple-choice (MC) evaluation mitigates
this issue, but generating high-quality distractors is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. We introduce D-GEN, the first open-source distractor generator
model that transforms open-ended data into an MC format. To evaluate distractor
quality, we propose two novel methods: (1) ranking alignment, ensuring
generated distractors retain the discriminatory power of ground-truth
distractors, and (2) entropy analysis, comparing model confidence
distributions. Our results show that D-GEN preserves ranking consistency
(Spearman's rho 0.99, Kendall's tau 0.94) and closely matches the entropy
distribution of ground-truth distractors. Human evaluation further confirms the
fluency, coherence, distractiveness, and incorrectness. Our work advances
robust and efficient distractor generation with automated evaluation, setting a
new standard for MC evaluation.

*Ritwik Mishra, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores context-shortening techniques (OIE, coreference resolution, APS) to improve QA performance in Indic languages, showing 4% and 47% gains in semantic and token-level scores, respectively, without fine-tuning. Fine-tuning adds 2% improvement. Computational overhead is reduced, but limitations remain for non-factoid questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of long contexts in QA tasks for low-resource Indic languages due to LLMs' quadratic self-attention complexity.

Method: Uses Open Information Extraction (OIE), coreference resolution, and Answer Paragraph Selection (APS) to shorten contexts. Evaluated on Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu with three LLMs.

Result: Average improvements of 4% (semantic) and 47% (token-level) without fine-tuning; 2% with fine-tuning. Computational overhead reduced.

Conclusion: Context-shortening enhances LLM-based QA efficiency, especially for low-resource languages, but struggles with non-factoid questions. Code and resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) tasks, which involve extracting answers from a given
context, are relatively straightforward for modern Large Language Models (LLMs)
when the context is short. However, long contexts pose challenges due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This challenge is
compounded in Indic languages, which are often low-resource. This study
explores context-shortening techniques, including Open Information Extraction
(OIE), coreference resolution, Answer Paragraph Selection (APS), and their
combinations, to improve QA performance. Compared to the baseline of
unshortened (long) contexts, our experiments on four Indic languages (Hindi,
Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu) demonstrate that context-shortening techniques yield
an average improvement of 4\% in semantic scores and 47\% in token-level scores
when evaluated on three popular LLMs without fine-tuning. Furthermore, with
fine-tuning, we achieve an average increase of 2\% in both semantic and
token-level scores. Additionally, context-shortening reduces computational
overhead. Explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP reveal that when the APS
model confidently identifies the paragraph containing the answer, nearly all
tokens within the selected text receive high relevance scores. However, the
study also highlights the limitations of LLM-based QA systems in addressing
non-factoid questions, particularly those requiring reasoning or debate.
Moreover, verbalizing OIE-generated triples does not enhance system
performance. These findings emphasize the potential of context-shortening
techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems,
especially for low-resource languages. The source code and resources are

Motivation: LLMs often generate repetitive text, but the root causes are not well understood. The study aims to explore and address this issue.

Method: The approach involves logit analysis to locate repetition-prone layers, SAE-based activation manipulation to identify 'Repetition Features,' and deactivating these features to reduce repetition.

Result: The method successfully identifies and mitigates repetition, validated by a custom dataset and evaluation pipeline.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic understanding of repetition in LLMs and offers a practical solution to reduce it.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in various
domains, yet they often suffer from repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we
refer to as the "Repeat Curse". While previous studies have proposed decoding
strategies to mitigate repetition, the underlying mechanism behind this issue
remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we investigate the root causes
of repetition in LLMs through the lens of mechanistic interpretability.
Inspired by recent advances in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), which enable
monosemantic feature extraction, we propose a novel approach, "Duplicatus
Charm", to induce and analyze the Repeat Curse. Our method systematically
identifies "Repetition Features" -the key model activations responsible for
generating repetitive outputs. First, we locate the layers most involved in
repetition through logit analysis. Next, we extract and stimulate relevant
features using SAE-based activation manipulation. To validate our approach, we
construct a repetition dataset covering token and paragraph level repetitions
and introduce an evaluation pipeline to quantify the influence of identified
repetition features. Furthermore, by deactivating these features, we have
effectively mitigated the Repeat Curse. The source code of our work is publicly

TL;DR: BitNet v2 enables native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs by addressing activation outliers with H-BitLinear, achieving performance parity with reduced memory and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation outliers in 1-bit LLMs complicate low-bit quantization, hindering efficient deployment.

Method: Introduces H-BitLinear, applying an online Hadamard transformation to smooth activation distributions for better 4-bit quantization.

Result: BitNet v2 matches BitNet b1.58 performance with 8-bit activations and shows minimal degradation with 4-bit activations.

Conclusion: BitNet v2 significantly reduces memory and computational costs while maintaining performance, enabling efficient deployment of 1-bit LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by
activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We
introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation
quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward
network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online
Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation
smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable
for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch
with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2
achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit
activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for
batched inference.

*Zhenhe Wu, Jian Yang, Jiaheng Liu, Xianjie Wu, Changzai Pan, Jie Zhang, Yu Zhao, Shuangyong Song, Yongxiang Li, Zhoujun Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Table-R1 enhances LLM table understanding via region-based reinforcement learning, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of table comprehension in LLMs by optimizing region identification and reasoning.

Method: Uses Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) and Table-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) for dynamic reward balancing.

Result: Achieves 14.36-point average improvement on benchmarks and reduces token use by 67.5%.

Conclusion: Table-R1 significantly advances LLM tabular reasoning efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Tables present unique challenges for language models due to their structured
row-column interactions, necessitating specialized approaches for effective
comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential
in table reasoning through prompting and techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT)
and program-of-thought (PoT), optimizing their performance for table question
answering remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce region-based
Table-R1, a novel reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM table
understanding by integrating region evidence into reasoning steps. Our method
employs Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) to guide models in
identifying relevant table regions before generating answers, incorporating
textual, symbolic, and program-based reasoning. Additionally, Table-Aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) introduces a mixed reward system to
dynamically balance region accuracy and answer correctness, with decaying
region rewards and consistency penalties to align reasoning steps. Experiments
show that Table-R1 achieves an average performance improvement of 14.36 points
across multiple base models on three benchmark datasets, even outperforming
baseline models with ten times the parameters, while TARPO reduces response
token consumption by 67.5% compared to GRPO, significantly advancing LLM
capabilities in efficient tabular reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating classical Chinese mathematical texts, assessing reasoning models' problem-solving abilities under linguistic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in processing Chinese ancient mathematical classics and evaluate reasoning models' capabilities in classical Chinese contexts.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 538 problems from 8 texts using machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, with dual evaluation modes (closed-book and open-book) for six reasoning models.

Result: Models partially comprehend and solve problems but underperform compared to modern tasks, highlighting the need for improved classical Chinese comprehension.

Conclusion: The study supports mining mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and offers insights for evaluating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural model capabilities.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese
ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for
evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses
the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models
under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through
machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems
were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on
the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and
difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous
problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were
designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese
mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially
comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains
inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models'
classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized
for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining
mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional
culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

*Junsik Kim, Jinwook Park, Kangil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSCF, a KGE method ensuring semantic consistency in entity transformations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistency in embedding differences before/after transformation, preserving inductive bias.

Method: RSCF uses shared affine transformation, rooted entity transformation, and normalization to enhance semantic consistency.

Result: RSCF significantly outperforms existing KGE methods in knowledge graph completion tasks.

Conclusion: RSCF's consistent semantic approach improves performance and robustness across relations.

Abstract: In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation specific entity
transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the consistency of
embedding differences before and after transformation remains unaddressed,
risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the embeddings. This
inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation representations
are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar
transformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations.
Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on
Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity
embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable
score distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE
method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF). Its entity transformation
has three features for enhancing semantic consistency: 1) shared affine
transformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) rooted entity
transformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the
transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale
reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency that preserve semantics on
embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and prediction modules for
enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion tasks with
distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all relations and their
frequencies.

*Zeinab Dehghani, Mohammed Naveed Akram, Koorosh Aslansefat, Adil Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMILE is a model-agnostic method that explains LLM responses by analyzing input changes and creating visual heat maps to highlight impactful words, improving transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) lack transparency in decision-making, which is problematic for trust and accountability. SMILE addresses this by providing clear explanations.

Method: SMILE alters inputs slightly, measures output changes, and generates heat maps to show which prompt parts influence responses the most.

Result: Tested on leading LLMs, SMILE demonstrated accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity in providing reliable explanations.

Conclusion: SMILE enhances LLM transparency, making AI more trustworthy by clarifying how models respond to prompts.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly
powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to
understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be
problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To
help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models
respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by
slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then
highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps
showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several
leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and
fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these
models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more
transparent and trustworthy.

*Bing Ma, Hai Zhuge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-dimensional framework for efficiently querying and managing scientific research approaches by identifying patterns, categorizing them, and using tree structures for similarity and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of querying and managing scientific approaches from vast papers is time-consuming and inefficient without a structured framework.

Method: Identifies approach patterns via top-down linguistic analysis, extracts approaches, categorizes them into five dimensions, and uses tree structures for similarity and clustering.

Result: A multi-dimensional approach space is created, enabling efficient and relevant querying with reduced search space.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves approach querying efficiency and relevance through structured categorization and clustering.

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

*Lorenzo Jaime Yu Flores, Ori Ernst, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes task-agnostic confidence metrics for text generation models to improve calibration without fine-tuning or heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current confidence metrics in text generation are poorly calibrated due to multiple valid answers, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: Introduces task-agnostic confidence metrics based solely on model output probabilities.

Result: Improved calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics enhance model confidence calibration, making predictions more reliable.

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text
generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions
with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially
dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well
calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be
many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a
confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple
sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence
metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated
with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics.
Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on
summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

TL;DR: A scalable approach was developed to create the first Vietnamese medical question benchmark (14k questions) to evaluate language models in healthcare, addressing resource and data fragmentation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure quality healthcare applications for non-English-speaking communities by providing standardized benchmarks despite resource limitations and fragmented data.

Method: Constructed a benchmark using verifiable sources (medical exams, clinical records) and expert annotations, featuring 14k questions across 34 specialties and four difficulty levels.

Result: Created a comprehensive Vietnamese medical benchmark with public and private sets (4k, 10k, 2k questions) for evaluating model breadth and depth.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable to other languages, with an open-source pipeline to support future multilingual medical benchmarks.

Abstract: Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of
language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore
help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every
community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively
build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is
normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle
this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question
benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical
specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources,
including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually
annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels,
ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to
typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design
enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical
understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and
in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a
sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a
private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains
all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other
languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the
development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

Conclusion: This is the first application of MMD to word sense change detection, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Word sense analysis is an essential analysis work for interpreting the
linguistic and social backgrounds. The word sense change detection is a task of
identifying and interpreting shifts in word meanings over time. This paper
proposes MMD-Sense-Analysis, a novel approach that leverages Maximum Mean

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical benchmarks lack real-world clinical relevance, diverse question types, and robust evaluation methods, limiting their effectiveness for assessing LLMs in medicine.

Method: Developed LLMEval-Med with 2,996 questions from EHRs and expert scenarios, an automated pipeline using LLM-as-Judge, and human-machine agreement analysis for validation.

Result: Evaluated 13 LLMs across three categories, providing insights for safe and effective LLM deployment in medicine.

Conclusion: LLMEval-Med offers a reliable, comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs in medical applications, with publicly available data.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because
medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current
medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive
medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have
limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often
not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor
assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present
LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996
questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed
clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline,
incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework.
Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine
agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert
feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories
(specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on
LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment
of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Cartridge,' a trained KV cache for efficient querying of large text corpora, using a 'self-study' training method to match ICL performance with lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for querying large corpora using large language models are costly due to high memory consumption of the KV cache.

Method: Train a smaller KV cache ('Cartridge') offline using synthetic conversations and a context-distillation objective, instead of naive next-token prediction.

Result: Cartridges match ICL performance with 38.6x less memory, 26.4x higher throughput, and extended effective context length.

Conclusion: Self-study-trained Cartridges offer a cost-effective, scalable alternative to ICL for querying large corpora, with added benefits like compositionality.

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle in medical scenarios due to limited knowledge coverage, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of tailored reasoning.

Method: Proposes a data curation procedure for rich medical knowledge, multi-stage training for Lingshu, and explores reinforcement learning. Introduces MedEvalKit for standardized evaluation.

Result: Lingshu outperforms existing open-source multimodal models on tasks like multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation.

Conclusion: The approach enhances MLLMs' medical capabilities, demonstrating the potential of specialized models and curated data in healthcare.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

TL;DR: The study evaluates large language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus) for detecting toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian. A manually labeled dataset of 4,500 YouTube/TikTok comments was used. Context-augmented prompts improved recall and F1 scores, with Gemini performing best. GPT-4.1 led in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online toxic language harms communities, especially in regions with limited moderation tools and labeled data (e.g., Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian). The study aims to improve toxicity detection in these low-resource languages.

Method: A dataset of 4,500 YouTube/TikTok comments was manually labeled. Four models were tested in zero-shot and context-augmented modes, measuring precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and false positives.

Result: Context-augmented prompts improved recall (by ~0.12) and F1 (up to 0.10). Gemini (context-augmented) achieved the best balance (F1: 0.82, accuracy: 0.82). GPT-4.1 (zero-shot) had the highest precision and lowest false alarms.

Conclusion: Adding minimal context improves toxicity detection in low-resource languages. Practical strategies like better prompts and threshold calibration can help underserved Balkan language communities.

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for dLLMs suffer from static behavior, leading to inefficiency and limited flexibility.

Method: Proposes SlowFast Sampling, guided by certainty, convergence, and positional principles, and integrates it with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.

Result: Achieves up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA and 34.22× with caching, outperforming autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput.

Conclusion: Well-designed sampling can unlock dLLMs' potential for fast, high-quality generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Method: Applies uniform quantization to convolutional blocks and log2 quantization to transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves significant latency reduction (2.5×-8.7×) with minimal accuracy loss on ImageNet-1K and performs well on edge devices.

Conclusion: EfficientQuant is practical for real-world edge deployment due to its low latency and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

*Divya Swetha K, Ziaul Haque Choudhury, Hemanta Kumar Bhuyan, Biswajit Brahma, Nilayam Kumar Kamila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes combining ESRGAN for image enhancement and Faster R-CNN for object detection to improve detection in low-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of accurate object detection in low-resolution images by enhancing image quality first.

Method: Uses ESRGAN to pre-process and enhance low-resolution images, followed by Faster R-CNN for detection.

Result: Superior performance compared to traditional methods on low-resolution inputs.

Conclusion: The integrated framework offers a robust solution for variable or limited image quality scenarios.

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on diverse tasks and explore the impact of Dense Channel Integration (DCI) on its capabilities.

Method: Tested LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three tasks, comparing standard and DCI-enhanced versions.

Result: Standard model leads in overall accuracy, especially in vision-heavy tasks, while DCI excels in semantic coherence and structured change understanding.

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with plug-and-play techniques like DCI shows promise for interleave tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based
Understanding and Interactive Multi-Modal Communication. Secondly, we add the
Dense Channel Integration (DCI) connector to the LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave and
compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard
model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or
structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces enhancements to the RefAV framework for scenario mining in autonomous driving, addressing LLM-generated code errors and spatial-relationship inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reliability and precision of scenario mining from autonomous driving datasets using LLMs.

Method: Proposes (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation mechanism and (2) specialized prompt engineering for spatial-relationship functions.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains, achieving a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enhance scenario mining reliability and precision.

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

Motivation: To demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI in automating complex tasks like computer vision system configuration, traditionally requiring human expertise.

Method: Extending SimpleMind with an LLM-based agent to interpret prompts, plan workflows, and configure tools for medical image analysis.

Result: The system autonomously configured, trained, and tested on 50 chest x-rays, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96 (lungs), 0.82 (heart), and 0.83 (ribs).

Conclusion: Agentic AI can autonomously perform planning and tool configuration, reducing reliance on data scientists in computer vision development.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on classifying iron ore pellets using the StarDist algorithm for improved quality control and measurement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately identify and analyze objects in dense, unstable environments, particularly for quality control in pellet production.

Method: Utilizes the StarDist algorithm for segmenting objects, determining contours, classifying pellets, and measuring dimensions, addressing limitations of traditional methods like ViT and Mask R-CNN.

Result: Developed a novel method for detecting objects with smoothed boundaries, enhancing measurement accuracy and size distribution analysis.

Conclusion: The StarDist-based approach provides a robust solution for pellet classification and measurement, overcoming challenges in complex environments.

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STT introduces an efficient image segmentation model using foveation and variable-resolution patch tokenization to reduce computational cost while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in image segmentation without reducing model size by focusing computational resources on the region of interest.

Method: Foveates input images, extracts crops centered on point prompts, and applies variable-resolution patch tokenization to reduce tokens.

Result: STT is more efficient than prior work, runs at interactive frame rates, and remains competitive on benchmarks.

Conclusion: STT is a promising tool for augmented reality and robotics due to its efficiency and performance.

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructCIR leverages LLMs to generate CIR training data from unannotated images, outperforming SOTA methods in zero-shot retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-annotated triplet data for CIR is costly and limits scalability; LLMs offer a scalable alternative.

Method: Uses large captioning and language models to generate CIR data and introduces an embedding reformulation architecture.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in zero-shot retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ; performance improves with more generated data.

Conclusion: LLMs can replace human annotations for CIR, enabling scalable training and competitive performance.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving images matching a
reference image augmented with a text, where the text describes changes to the
reference image in natural language. Traditionally, models designed for CIR
have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text,
and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates
human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered
the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant
unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a
shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently
replaced by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate the
capability of large captioning and language models in efficiently generating
data for CIR only relying on unannotated image collections. Additionally, we
introduce an embedding reformulation architecture that effectively combines
image and text modalities. Our model, named InstructCIR, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot composed image retrieval on CIRR and
FashionIQ datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by increasing the amount
of generated data, our zero-shot model gets closer to the performance of
supervised baselines.

TL;DR: The paper examines gender fairness in ML/DL models for pain detection using facial expressions, finding biases despite high accuracy, especially with ViT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-researched accuracy and fairness of pain detection algorithms across demographic groups, focusing on gender.

Method: Evaluated traditional ML (L SVM, RBF SVM) and DL (CNN, ViT) models on the UNBC-McMaster database using performance and fairness metrics.

Result: ViT showed highest accuracy but all models exhibited gender biases, revealing a trade-off between accuracy and fairness.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware techniques are needed to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Motivation: To enhance navigation accuracy and transparency in diverse environments by combining sensor data and semantic reasoning.

Method: Uses a dual-branch architecture with an Adaptive Kalman Filter and vision-language models (LLaMA, BLIP-2) for action prediction and explanations.

Result: Improves navigation success by 20%, with efficient, grounded, and clear explanations.

Conclusion: Connects semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer, more trustworthy autonomous systems.

Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate
state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a
novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power
of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation
actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed
chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically
adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages
several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models
such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the
MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation,
autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and
human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that
PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high
efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This

TL;DR: A method for estimating 3D hand articulation from 2D keypoints without needing camera parameters, using keypoint alignment and fingertip loss, showing competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of 3D hand articulation estimation from a single color image is challenging due to lack of depth, occlusions, and articulation complexity. Existing methods often require camera parameters, which this work aims to bypass.

Method: Proposes an optimization pipeline with keypoint alignment and fingertip loss to eliminate the need for camera parameters. Evaluated on EgoDexter and Dexter+Object benchmarks.

Result: Competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, robust for 'in-the-wild' images without prior camera knowledge. Sensitivity to 2D keypoint accuracy noted.

Conclusion: The approach effectively estimates 3D hand articulation without camera parameters, demonstrating robustness and competitive performance, though reliant on accurate 2D keypoints.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextLoss (CLoss), a novel loss function for image segmentation that improves topological correctness by considering the context of errors in critical pixel masks. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods, repairing up to 44% more missed connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological errors in segmented structures (e.g., roads, vessels) can impact functionality (e.g., navigation). Existing solutions lack context-awareness for such errors.

Method: Proposes CLoss, which incorporates the whole context of topological errors in critical pixel masks, enhancing focus on these errors. Introduces two metrics to measure connectivity improvements.

Result: CLoss improves performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed connections than other methods, validated on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CLoss effectively enhances topological correctness in segmentation tasks, with significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

TL;DR: JAFAR is a lightweight, attention-based feature upsampler that enhances spatial resolution for Foundation Vision Encoders, outperforming existing methods without high-resolution supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation Vision Encoders produce low-resolution features, requiring upsampling for high-resolution downstream tasks. Existing methods lack flexibility and performance.

Method: JAFAR uses an attention-based module with Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation to align high-resolution queries with low-resolution keys.

Result: JAFAR recovers fine-grained details and outperforms other upsampling methods across diverse tasks, generalizing well to higher scales.

Conclusion: JAFAR is a versatile and effective solution for feature upsampling, enhancing performance in dense vision tasks.

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A holistic framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation improves pseudo-label utilization, addresses class imbalance, and leverages uncertainty via fuzzy pseudo-labeling, dynamic weighting, adaptive rebalancing, and contrastive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SSSS include ineffective pseudo-label use, class imbalance biases, and ignored prediction uncertainty. Current methods discard uncertain regions, favoring dominant classes.

Method: The framework includes fuzzy pseudo-labeling, uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, adaptive class rebalancing, and lightweight contrastive regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively transforms uncertainty into a learning asset, improving segmentation performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: The system aids teacher reflection and improvement, contributing a culturally grounded method to AI-based educational analytics.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing

TL;DR: AlignHuman improves human animation by optimizing motion naturalness and visual fidelity using timestep-segment preference optimization and specialized LoRAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between motion naturalness and visual fidelity in human video generation.

Method: Proposes AlignHuman with timestep-segment preference optimization (TPO) and two specialized LoRAs for motion and fidelity.

Result: Achieves a 3.3× speedup (100 to 30 NFEs) with minimal quality loss, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: AlignHuman effectively balances motion and fidelity, enhancing human animation efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset
encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation,
medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing
that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance.
Our dataset and code, aiming to catalyze multimodal medical AI research and
establish a robust foundation for 3D medical visual understanding, are publicly

*Melvin Wong, Yueming Lyu, Thiago Rios, Stefan Menzel, Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-to-Phy3D enhances LLM-to-3D models by integrating physical constraints, improving physical viability and geometric novelty in 3D designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-to-3D models lack physical knowledge, leading to outputs that ignore real-world constraints, limiting their use in engineering design.

Method: LLM-to-Phy3D introduces an online black-box refinement loop using visual and physics-based evaluations to iteratively refine prompts for better 3D outputs.

Result: The method improves physical conformity by 4.5% to 106.7% over conventional models, demonstrated in vehicle design optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D shows promise for broader applications in Physical AI, bridging the gap between generative AI and engineering design.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

*Jonathan Grizou, Carlos de la Torre-Ortiz, Tuukka Ruotsalo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURSOR is a novel framework for recovering mental targets from EEG and image data without labeled information, achieving human-like perceptual judgments and generating indistinguishable stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of recovering mental targets (e.g., faces) from EEG and image data without labeled data, a problem previously unexplored in self-calibration settings.

Method: The CURSOR algorithm learns to recover unknown mental targets by predicting image similarity scores and ranking stimuli without labeled data or pre-trained decoders.

Result: CURSOR successfully predicts image similarity scores correlating with human judgments, ranks stimuli against unknown targets, and generates indistinguishable stimuli (validated by a user study, N=53).

Conclusion: CURSOR demonstrates the feasibility of self-calibrated mental target recovery, opening new avenues for EEG-based applications without labeled data.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

TL;DR: AutoCaption uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to create diverse video captions for benchmarking MLLMs, improving evaluation and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning benchmarks have issues like lack of diversity, high data creation costs, and limited evaluation scope.

Method: Proposes AutoCaption, an MCTS-based framework to iteratively generate diverse and detailed video captions, forming the MCTS-VCB benchmark.

Result: MCTS-VCB effectively evaluates MLLMs, with Gemini-1.5-Pro scoring highest (71.2 F1). Fine-tuning with AutoCaption data boosts performance by 25% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on DREAM-1K.

Conclusion: AutoCaption enhances video captioning evaluation and model training, demonstrating its utility for MLLMs.

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

*Aaron Banze, Timothée Stassin, Nassim Ait Ali Braham, Rıdvan Salih Kuzu, Simon Besnard, Michael Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is introduced to benchmark geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs), combining hyperspectral imagery and lidar-derived AGB estimates across seven regions. Geo-FMs perform comparably or better than a baseline U-Net, with performance influenced by dataset size and token patch size. The dataset aims to support Geo-FM development and research on geographic bias and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets for Geo-FMs are limited to specific tasks and regions, lacking diversity. This work addresses the gap by providing a globally distributed dataset for pixel-wise regression tasks like AGB estimation.

Method: The dataset combines hyperspectral imagery from EnMAP and lidar-derived AGB estimates, covering seven continental regions. Geo-FMs are evaluated against a baseline U-Net, with fine-tuning and analysis of token patch size in Vision Transformers.

Result: Geo-FMs match or surpass U-Net performance, especially with fine-tuning. Performance varies with dataset size and token patch size.

Conclusion: The dataset supports Geo-FM development and research on geographic bias and generalization. Public release of the dataset and code aims to foster further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EyeSimVQA is a novel VQA framework using free-energy-based self-repair, featuring a dual-branch architecture for global and fine-grained analysis, achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA systems struggle with spatiotemporal complexity and backbone constraints, limiting enhancement module integration.

Method: Proposes EyeSimVQA with dual-branch architecture (aesthetic and technical), specialized enhancement modules, and a biologically inspired prediction head.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five VQA benchmarks with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA effectively addresses VQA challenges, offering robust performance and biologically grounded design.

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in VLMs' ability to infer social cues and proposes a new task, Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference, to evaluate VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human social behavior requires non-verbal cues, which current LLMs lack and VLMs' capabilities in this area are understudied.

Method: The authors identify the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap, propose a new task, and benchmark VLMs using a high-quality dataset.

Result: The study benchmarks VLMs' performance on the new task, highlighting their limitations in social reasoning.

Conclusion: VLMs have a gap in social-pragmatic inference, and the proposed task and dataset provide a foundation for future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method uses synthetic data to visualize the Earth's subsurface, improving accuracy with borehole data and enabling applications in resource exploration and hazard assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of visualizing the Earth's subsurface for applications like resource exploration and hazard assessment motivates the development of a deep learning approach.

Method: The method involves training a neural network on synthetic data mimicking geological processes, supplemented by surface and borehole data, to generate 3D subsurface images.

Result: The trained model produces high-fidelity 3D images of subsurface structures, with accuracy improving with more borehole data.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for subsurface visualization and can be fine-tuned for regional applications, serving as a regularizer in inverse problem-solving.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Motivation: To enhance Sentinel-2 imagery resolution and spectral consistency, addressing limitations of current super-resolution and pansharpening methods.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: (1) diffusion-based SR trained on high-res RGB data, (2) fusion network for multispectral upscaling using RGB as a spatial prior. Includes degradation model and encoder for blind SR.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in fidelity, spectral consistency, and spatial alignment. Fusion network surpasses classical pansharpening for 20m/60m bands.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of generative priors and fusion for modular Sentinel-2 SR. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework enhances LLMs' reasoning for medical image diagnosis using test-time scaling, improving accuracy across imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored application of LLMs in visual question answering for medical imaging and the impracticality of supervised fine-tuning due to data and cost constraints.

Method: A vision-language model processes medical images and textual prompts to generate visual feature interpretations, which are consolidated by an LLM using test-time scaling for reliable diagnosis.

Result: The framework improves diagnostic accuracy across radiology, ophthalmology, and histopathology, with unbiased prompting enhancing reliability and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot framework effectively enhances LLMs' diagnostic reasoning in clinical settings without requiring extensive labeled data.

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Motivation: The rise of interconnected devices and V2X communications has boosted TD, but safe operations require reliable detection of cars and pedestrians from point cloud data.

Method: The study uses the expanded SELMA dataset with ground-truth bounding boxes, testing state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object detectors on metrics like efficiency, time, and accuracy.

Result: Performance of compression and detection methods is analyzed, including their impact on V2X network data rate and latency, compared to 3GPP standards for TD.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into optimizing object detection and compression for TD, ensuring safety and meeting network requirements.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

*Yanlong Chen, Mattia Orlandi, Pierangelo Maria Rapa, Simone Benatti, Luca Benini, Yawei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based model, improves sEMG gesture recognition by integrating time and frequency features, achieving high accuracy with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying similar gestures with nearly identical sEMG signals is challenging, and traditional deep learning models are too large for embedded systems.

Method: Proposes WaveFormer, using a learnable wavelet transform and WaveletConv module for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves 95% accuracy on EPN612 dataset with 3.1M parameters and 6.75 ms inference latency.

Conclusion: WaveFormer is efficient, accurate, and suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data from satellites is crucial for large-scale or inaccessible areas, but its resolution needs assessment for mission utility and improvement tracking.

Method: The study introduces 3D metric evaluation tools and workflows for automated resolution assessment, leveraging high-resolution airborne lidar as a reference.

Result: Analyses were conducted on data of varying quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation methods.

*Hongyu Chen, Jiping Liu, Yong Wang, Jun Zhu, Dejun Feng, Yakun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SF-TMAT is a novel framework for UAV object detection in adverse scenes, addressing domain gaps and noisy pseudo-labels through dynamic mask adjustment and variance feedback smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods fail in UAV imagery under adverse conditions due to unique perspectives and noise, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: SF-TMAT uses DSFMA for dynamic mask adjustment and VFST for threshold smoothing, improving pseudo-label quality and feature alignment.

Result: SF-TMAT outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior generalization in adverse UAV scenes.

Conclusion: SF-TMAT sets a benchmark for UAV object detection in adverse conditions, offering robust feature alignment and pseudo-label refinement.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

*Nguyen Linh Dan Le, Jing Ren, Ciyuan Peng, Chengyao Xie, Bowen Li, Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMAP is a multimodal graph learning framework for efficient identification of neurodegenerative disease-affected brain regions, reducing computational overhead by 50% and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods lack precision in localizing disease-relevant brain regions and face high computational complexity.

Method: BrainMAP uses atlas-driven filtering to extract critical subgraphs and employs multimodal fusion with cross-node attention and adaptive gating for fMRI and DTI data.

Result: BrainMAP reduces computational overhead by over 50% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: BrainMAP offers a precise and computationally efficient solution for identifying neurodegenerative disease-affected brain regions.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

*Amirali Ataee Naeini, Ashkan Teymouri, Ghazaleh Jafarsalehi, Michael Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model improves vehicle speed detection accuracy, lane identification, and vehicle classification (cars vs. heavy vehicles) for traffic monitoring in California.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in vehicle numbers and inadequate transportation systems in California require better speed detection methods, especially for HOV lanes and heavy vehicle restrictions.

Method: The study uses a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model trained on 800 bird's-eye view images, analyzing factors like drone height, ROI distance, and vehicle speed.

Result: The model achieved a mean absolute error of 0.97 mph and mean squared error of 0.94 mph², outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses vehicle speed detection and classification challenges, proving suitable for traffic regulation.

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

*Yuwen Tan, Boqing Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from data-tracing to knowledge-tracing machine unlearning for foundation models (FMs), aligning with practical needs and cognitive insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-tracing unlearning is insufficient for FMs due to diverse unlearning requests and lack of access to massive training data. Knowledge-tracing better aligns with human cognitive processes.

Method: The paper suggests knowledge-tracing unlearning, supported by practical needs and cognitive studies, and illustrates it with a vision-language FM case study.

Result: Knowledge-tracing unlearning is presented as a more feasible and cognitively aligned approach for FMs.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for knowledge-tracing unlearning as a superior paradigm for FMs, supported by practicality and cognitive science.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments dynamically change across space and time, posing challenges for world modeling. The goal is to capture these dynamics for better agent behavior.

Method: The authors create STRIDE, a dataset with interconnected observation, state, and action nodes from 360-degree imagery. They use TARDIS, a transformer-based model, to integrate spatial and temporal dynamics.

Result: TARDIS achieves robust performance in tasks like photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous control, and georeferencing.

Conclusion: The approach advances generalist agents by enhancing their ability to understand and manipulate spatio-temporal dynamics. Resources are publicly available.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GynSurg, a large, diverse dataset for gynecologic laparoscopy, addressing limitations of existing datasets to improve surgical AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for gynecologic laparoscopy are limited in scale, task focus, or annotation detail, hindering comprehensive workflow analysis.

Method: The authors introduce GynSurg, a multi-task dataset with rich annotations for tasks like action recognition and semantic segmentation, and benchmark state-of-the-art models.

Result: GynSurg is demonstrated to be high-quality and versatile, supporting various surgical AI applications.

Conclusion: The dataset is publicly released to accelerate progress in surgical AI for gynecologic laparoscopy.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

*Yihan Wu, Xuehao Cui, Ruibo Chen, Georgios Milis, Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C-reweight is a novel watermarking method for image generation models that addresses retokenization mismatch, improving detectability without distorting image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of image generation models (e.g., deepfakes, phishing) necessitates robust authenticity verification, but traditional watermarking techniques fail due to retokenization mismatch.

Method: C-reweight uses a clustering-based strategy to treat tokens equivalently, mitigating retokenization mismatch while preserving image fidelity.

Result: Evaluations show C-reweight maintains visual quality and outperforms existing distortion-free watermarking methods in detectability.

Conclusion: C-reweight sets a new standard for secure and trustworthy image synthesis by effectively addressing retokenization mismatch.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

*Xianlu Li, Nicolas Nadisic, Shaoguang Huang, Nikos Deligiannis, Aleksandra Pižurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable deep clustering method for hyperspectral images (HSIs) jointly optimizes local and non-local spatial structures with linear complexity, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subspace clustering methods for HSIs are computationally intensive and lack effective supervision for the entire clustering process due to separate handling of local and non-local structures.

Method: The proposed method uses a one-stage framework with spatial smoothness constraints for local structure and mini-cluster-based refinement for non-local structure, both jointly optimized.

Result: The method achieves linear complexity (O(n)) and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is efficient, scalable, and effective for large-scale HSI clustering, combining local and non-local constraints in a unified framework.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating and refining text-image plans step-by-step, addressing alignment and coherence challenges in multimodal task planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focuses on textual plan generation, leaving text-image plans understudied. Challenges include modality alignment and visual coherence.

Method: Proposes a framework that iteratively drafts textual steps, edits visual steps, extracts PDDL-like visual info, and refines drafts. Compatible with models like Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o.

Result: Evaluated on a new benchmark of 1,100 tasks across 11 topics, with designed metrics showing effectiveness in multimodal consistency and coherence.

Conclusion: The approach improves multimodal task planning and is adaptable to various backbone models.

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

TL;DR: A new dynamic bidirectional spatial tower replaces attention mechanisms to improve VQA models' reasoning and spatial relationship understanding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods struggle with complex reasoning due to weak cross-modal interaction and poor spatial relationship capture.

Method: Proposed a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower with four layers, inspired by human gestalt vision, to enhance spatial organization and reasoning.

Result: The module works with any multimodal model, achieving advanced results, and the July model (3B parameters) set state-of-the-art performance on spatial relation datasets.

Conclusion: The approach shifts from 'seeing images' to 'perceiving and organizing' them, proving effective for spatial reasoning in VQA.

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a preference learning method, \mymethod, to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by targeting specific areas where errors occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate incorrect information about objects not present in input images, undermining reliability in vision-language tasks.

Method: A preference learning approach is applied to a dataset of hallucinated and correct responses, focusing on targeted areas to filter irrelevant signals.

Result: Experiments show \mymethod reduces hallucinations in vision tasks, improving reliability without overall performance loss.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses hallucination issues in MLLMs, enhancing their practical applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Auto-Connect is a novel rigging method that preserves skeletal connectivity via tokenization, topology-aware rewards, and geodesic features, improving anatomical accuracy and deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rigging methods often fail to preserve skeletal connectivity or require manual adjustments, leading to inaccurate or inefficient results.

Method: Uses connectivity-preserving tokenization, topology-aware reward functions, and geodesic features for bone selection.

Result: Generates anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties.

Conclusion: Auto-Connect outperforms previous methods by integrating connectivity and topology directly into the prediction framework.

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Motivation: Existing auditing methods for text-to-image diffusion models rely on unrealistic assumptions or unreliable evaluations, creating a gap for a practical solution.

Method: FSCA uses semantic connections within the model for auditing, avoiding internal knowledge access. It includes recall balance and threshold adjustment strategies.

Result: FSCA outperforms eight baselines on LAION-mi and COCO datasets, achieving 90% user-level accuracy with minimal samples.

Conclusion: FSCA is effective and practical for real-world auditing, demonstrating superior performance and potential.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

### [174] [TAViS: Text-bridged Audio-Visual Segmentation with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11436)
*Ziyang Luo, Nian Liu, Xuguang Yang, Salman Khan, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAViS is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) that combines multimodal (ImageBind) and segmentation (SAM2) foundation models, addressing cross-modal alignment challenges with a text-bridged design and alignment supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of aligning audio and visual modalities in AVS, where existing methods fail to effectively combine foundation models for cross-modal alignment.

Method: TAViS couples ImageBind for cross-modal alignment and SAM2 for segmentation, using a text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism and alignment supervision strategy.

Result: Superior performance on single-source, multi-source, semantic datasets, and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: TAViS effectively addresses cross-modal alignment challenges in AVS by leveraging multimodal and segmentation foundation models with a text-bridged design.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised contrastive learning model with uncertainty awareness improves cancer subtyping by strategically selecting annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cancer subtyping models by incorporating uncertainty awareness, reducing reliance on extensive expert annotations.

Method: Introduces uncertainty awareness via an evidence vector to assess prediction confidence, using the uncertainty score to guide selective annotation and iterative training refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1-10% of strategically selected annotations.

Conclusion: The method minimizes the need for labeled data while improving classification precision, offering a promising approach for digital pathology with limited labeled datasets.

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V2LMs (Vehicle Vision Language Models) outperform traditional DNNs in AV perception by maintaining high accuracy under adversarial attacks without adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNNs in AVs are vulnerable to attacks, and existing defenses degrade benign accuracy or fail against unseen threats.

Method: Introduces V2LMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, evaluated in Solo Mode (task-specific) and Tandem Mode (multi-task).

Result: V2LMs show <8% accuracy drop under attacks vs. DNNs' 33-46% drop. Tandem Mode is memory-efficient and robust.

Conclusion: V2LMs enhance AV perception security and resilience, offering a promising alternative to DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

*Wasim Ahmad, Yan-Tsung Peng, Yuan-Hao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAME is a lightweight spatio-temporal framework for attributing face-swap Deepfakes to their generative models, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Deepfake videos threatens digital security and media integrity, but current research lacks focus on model attribution (identifying the source model).

Method: FAME uses multilevel embeddings with spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to detect subtle generative artifacts.

Result: FAME outperforms existing methods on DFDM, FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb datasets in accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: FAME shows promise for real-world forensic and security applications due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

### [178] [Environmental Change Detection: Toward a Practical Task of Scene Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11481)
*Kyusik Cho, Suhan Woo, Hongje Seong, Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Environmental Change Detection (ECD) to address the practical limitation of Scene Change Detection (SCD) by using unaligned reference images and leveraging environmental cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SCD methods assume perfectly aligned reference images, which is unrealistic. The paper aims to make change detection more practical by using uncurated, viewpoint-misaligned reference images.

Method: The proposed framework aggregates semantically rich representations from multiple reference candidates to detect changes, overcoming viewpoint misalignment and limited FOV.

Result: The framework outperforms naive combinations of state-of-the-art methods and achieves performance close to the oracle setting on three benchmark sets.

Conclusion: ECD is a more practical approach to change detection, and the proposed framework effectively handles viewpoint misalignment using environmental cues.

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced Synthetic Image Detection (SID) method using data augmentation and genetic algorithms to improve detection of AI-generated images altered by real-world perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Generative AI tools allows easy creation and spread of misleading synthetic images on social media, threatening online information integrity. Existing SID methods struggle with altered images.

Method: The research explores data augmentation combinations, uses a genetic algorithm for optimal augmentation selection, and introduces dual-criteria optimization.

Result: The approach significantly improves model performance, with the best model achieving a +22.53% mean average precision increase over non-augmented models.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for developing robust SID models capable of detecting synthetic images across varying qualities and transformations.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

*Tung-Long Vuong, Hoang Phan, Vy Vo, Anh Bui, Thanh-Toan Do, Trung Le, Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve pseudo-labels in UDA by leveraging the geometry of visual and text embeddings in pre-trained models like CLIP, addressing deviations in embedding distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods using CLIP rely on pseudo-labels and self-training, but visual embedding deviations in target domains can misguide class descriptions. This work aims to reinforce pseudo-labels and enhance target-prompt learning.

Method: The approach exploits the geometry of embeddings, using source-target visual embedding relationships and clustering behavior. It applies optimal transport theory to enforce clustering in text embeddings for better alignment.

Result: Experiments show superior performance and improved target-prompt representation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses embedding distribution deviations, enhancing UDA performance and pseudo-label reliability.

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

*Xiao Xu, Libo Qin, Wanxiang Che, Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manager, a lightweight plugin for Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs, enhancing performance by adaptively aggregating unimodal expert insights. It outperforms baselines on downstream tasks and improves zero-shot performance in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in BridgeTower, such as poor layer-by-layer unimodal representation use and limited flexibility in exploiting unimodal knowledge, while extending evaluation to high-resolution datasets.

Method: Proposes ManagerTower, integrating a manager in each cross-modal layer to aggregate insights from pre-trained unimodal experts, and extends it to MLLMs like LLaVA-OV.

Result: Outperforms baselines on 4 VL tasks and boosts LLaVA-OV's zero-shot performance across 20 datasets, with synergy between the manager and multi-grid algorithm improving visual representation.

Conclusion: Manager is an effective plugin for VLMs and MLLMs, enhancing performance by better utilizing unimodal knowledge and visual details.

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

*Samuel Cerezo, Javier Civera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a GNSS-inertial initialization strategy delaying global GNSS measurements until sufficient data is available, using Hessian matrix singular values to determine the switch timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor initial estimates from limited measurements can lead to local minima in non-linear optimization.

Method: Uses GNSS relative distance residuals initially and switches to global measurements based on Hessian matrix singular values.

Result: Outperforms naive global GNSS usage, providing more accurate and robust initializations on EuRoC and GVINS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy improves initialization accuracy and robustness by delaying global GNSS measurements.

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIMA-Q is a novel post-training quantization method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that improves accuracy, especially in low-bit quantization, by leveraging KL divergence and an efficient FIM approximation (DPLR-FIM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PTQ methods for ViTs suffer from significant accuracy degradation, particularly under low-bit quantization, due to limitations in conventional Hessian approximations.

Method: The paper proposes FIMA-Q, which connects KL divergence to FIM for fast quantization loss computation and introduces DPLR-FIM for efficient FIM approximation.

Result: Extensive experiments show FIMA-Q outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods, especially in low-bit scenarios, across various ViT architectures and tasks.

Conclusion: FIMA-Q addresses the shortcomings of existing PTQ methods for ViTs, offering a more accurate and efficient solution for model compression.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Motivation: Climate change increases extreme weather events, necessitating better early detection for disaster response.

Method: Proposes SITS-Extreme, leveraging satellite image time series with pre-disaster observations to filter noise and detect disasters.

Result: Validated on real-world and synthetic datasets, outperforming bi-temporal baselines, with insights on scalability and disaster type performance.

Conclusion: SITS-Extreme offers accurate, scalable detection for large-scale disaster monitoring.

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing
significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such

SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to

approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for

TL;DR: The paper reformulates rotation estimation as a linear model fitting problem, introduces a voting-based method leveraging GPU power, and demonstrates robustness to noise and outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust rotation estimation is crucial for safety-critical applications, but traditional methods are non-linear and non-convex. This paper seeks simpler, more efficient solutions.

Method: Reformulates rotation estimation as a linear problem, uses a voting-based approach on a quaternion sphere, and leverages GPU parallelism for efficiency.

Result: Achieves robust solutions for large-scale (10^6) and highly corrupted (99% outliers) problems in under 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed method is highly effective and robust, validated by controlled and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DaMO is a data-efficient Video LLM designed for fine-grained temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding, outperforming prior methods in tasks requiring precise temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal reasoning, limiting their ability to attribute responses to specific video moments under constrained supervision.

Method: DaMO uses a Temporal-aware Fuseformer with a hierarchical dual-stream architecture for temporal dynamics and multimodal fusion, plus a global residual for efficiency. Training involves a four-stage progressive paradigm for multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning.

Result: DaMO surpasses prior methods in temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks, excelling in precise temporal alignment tasks.

Conclusion: DaMO sets a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling, addressing limitations in temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

*Jiachen Yu, Yufei Zhan, Ziheng Wu, Yousong Zhu, Jinqiao Wang, Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline and benchmark (VFaith-Bench) to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning faithfulness by altering visual cues and analyzing performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why long CoT enhances MLLMs' problem-solving and quantifying the role of visual cues and reasoning in performance improvements.

Method: Developed a cue-driven editing pipeline (GPT-Image-1) and VFaith-Bench with 755 entries to test MLLMs' visual reasoning and faithfulness.

Result: Average accuracy and performance differences reveal the relationship between reasoning ability and visual perception.

Conclusion: VFaith-Bench provides insights into MLLMs' reasoning capabilities and their dependence on visual faithfulness.

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: A CNN-based method (YOLOv8s) is proposed for detecting lifted truck axles in images, achieving high precision (87%) and recall (91.7%) with fast inference time (1.4 ms).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WIM systems struggle to classify vehicles with lifted axles, and few methods exist for this detection.

Method: Uses YOLOv8s, a convolutional neural network, to detect lifted axles in truck images captured by perpendicular cameras.

Result: Achieved 87% precision, 91.7% recall, and 1.4 ms inference time, suitable for real-time use.

Conclusion: The method is effective but could improve with larger datasets or image augmentation.

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

*Juno Kim, Yesol Park, Hye-Jung Yoon, Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OV-MAP enhances 3D mapping for robots by integrating open-features and a class-agnostic segmentation model, improving zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overlapping features in 3D maps reduce instance-level precision, blending neighboring regions, which OV-MAP aims to address.

Method: Uses a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D space, combines raw and synthetic depth, and employs a 3D mask voting mechanism.

Result: Demonstrates superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability on datasets like ScanNet200 and Replica, and in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: OV-MAP effectively improves 3D instance segmentation accuracy and adaptability in diverse environments without 3D supervision.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

*Mert Unsal, Aylin Akkus*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EasyARC, a multimodal benchmark for vision-language models, focusing on multi-image, multi-step reasoning and self-correction. It evaluates state-of-the-art models and highlights their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack true visual reasoning with complex vision-language interactions. The ARC challenge inspired the creation of EasyARC to address this gap.

Method: EasyARC is procedurally generated, scalable, and verifiable, with progressive difficulty levels. It is designed for RL pipelines and evaluates vision-language models.

Result: Benchmarking reveals failure modes in state-of-the-art models, demonstrating EasyARC's effectiveness in assessing reasoning and scaling capabilities.

Conclusion: EasyARC sets a new standard for evaluating vision-language models and is open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

### [191] [A$^2$LC: Active and Automated Label Correction for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11599)
*Youjin Jeon, Kyusik Cho, Suhan Woo, Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework, A²LC, integrates automated label correction into Active Label Correction for semantic segmentation, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in manual pixel-wise annotation and enhance correction efficiency in semantic segmentation.

Method: Proposes A²LC with an automated correction stage and an adaptively balanced acquisition function for underrepresented classes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high efficiency (20% budget) and a 27.23% performance improvement on Cityscapes.

Conclusion: A²LC is a cost-effective and efficient solution for label correction in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Ruobei Zhang, Shengeng Tang, Huan Yan, Xiang Zhang, Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal method for WiFi-based human behavior recognition combines phase and Doppler Shift data, using dual-branch self-attention and group attention to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single data types, missing the potential of feature interaction and fusion.

Method: Uses phase and Doppler Shift data, dual-branch self-attention, group attention, and a gating mechanism for cross-modal collaboration.

Result: Outperforms on Widar3.0 and XRF55 datasets in in-domain and cross-domain tests.

Conclusion: The method enhances recognition accuracy by effectively fusing multimodal features.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

*Xu Wang, Shengeng Tang, Lechao Cheng, Feng Li, Shuo Wang, Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignAligner, a novel method for realistic sign language generation, uses text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and video synthesis to improve accuracy and expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving realistic and naturalistic sign language generation is challenging due to the complexity of gestures, expressions, and movements.

Method: SignAligner involves three stages: text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and realistic video synthesis, leveraging Transformer-based text encoding and cross-modal attention.

Result: Extensive experiments show SignAligner significantly enhances the accuracy and expressiveness of generated sign videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances sign language generation by addressing multimodal complexity and improving realism.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

*Kuniko Paxton, Koorosh Aslansefat, Dhavalkumar Thakker, Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fairness evaluation technique for ML in image classification, focusing on skin color as tensor data without rigid categorization, using probability distributions and statistical distance measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in fairness research for tensor-based sensitive attributes like skin color, which differs from categorical features like gender or race.

Method: Converts skin color tensor data into probability distributions, applies statistical distance measures, and proposes a training method using Bayesian regression with polynomial functions to mitigate biases.

Result: Enables fine-grained fairness evaluation and more equitable treatment of skin color in ML models.

Conclusion: The approach provides a nuanced and effective way to handle fairness in ML for skin color, improving over traditional categorical methods.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

*Emre Kavak, Tom Nuno Wolf, Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM, a model to address prediction shortcuts by analyzing causal pathways, and DISCO, a regularization method for bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models may use irrelevant signals (e.g., lighting conditions) for predictions due to bias, leading to undesirable shortcuts.

Method: Proposes SAM for causal analysis and DISCO, a regularization strategy using conditional distance correlation for conditional independence.

Result: DISCO achieves competitive results in bias mitigation, proving effective against classical methods.

Conclusion: SAM and DISCO provide a robust framework to mitigate bias by enforcing causal relevance in predictions.

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

*Yunhan Ren, Ruihuang Li, Lingbo Liu, Changwen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline for prohibited items in X-ray images, leveraging SAM and a bilayer mask decoder to address appearance gaps and overlapping objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, along with severe overlapping, makes instance segmentation challenging.

Method: Integrates SAM for representation and designs an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder to model occlusion relationships. Uses manually annotated occlusion areas in PIDray and PIXray datasets.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on occlusion-annotated datasets PIDray-A and PIXray-A.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses challenges in X-ray image segmentation, with datasets and code made available.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

*Chendi Ge, Xin Wang, Zeyang Zhang, Hong Chen, Jiapei Fan, Longtao Huang, Hui Xue, Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes D-MoLE, a method for evolving MLLM architectures under parameter budgets to dynamically adapt to new tasks, addressing task architecture conflicts and modality imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed-architecture MLLMs struggle with adapting to evolving tasks due to static capacity, necessitating dynamic adaptation methods.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts (D-MoLE), featuring a dynamic layer-wise expert allocator and a gradient-based inter-modal continual curriculum.

Result: D-MoLE achieves a 15% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: D-MoLE effectively addresses continual learning challenges for MLLMs, pioneering architectural evolution in this context.

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM-CGNS, a method for learning medical visual representations by addressing limitations in negative sampling, local detail extraction, and low-level feature retention through cross-modal clustering and masked image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for medical visual representation learning suffer from poor negative sampling, lack of fine-grained local details, and neglect of low-level features, which are critical for accurate medical analysis.

Method: The proposed CM-CGNS method uses cross-modal attention to extend k-means clustering for negative sampling and introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image Reconstruction module to enhance cross-modal interaction and retain low-level features.

Result: Experiments on five downstream datasets show CM-CGNS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CM-CGNS effectively addresses key limitations and learns robust medical visual representations, demonstrating superior performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates airway imaging biomarkers for predicting survival in lung fibrosis patients using a three-stage method: segmentation, feature extraction, and SVM classification, achieving scores of 0.8601 and 0.7346 for tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the predictive value of airway-related imaging biomarkers for survival outcomes in lung fibrosis patients.

Method: A three-stage approach: 1) nn-Unet for airway segmentation, 2) radiomic feature extraction from trachea and airway regions, 3) SVM classifier for survival prediction.

Result: Achieved segmentation score of 0.8601 (Task 1) and classification score of 0.7346 (Task 2).

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages airway imaging biomarkers for survival prediction in lung fibrosis, with promising results.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

TL;DR: A study on human action recognition using a subset of COCO images found that a binary Vision Transformer (ViT) outperformed other models, achieving 90% accuracy, with explainability tools highlighting its focus on pose-specific regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark and compare the performance of various models, including transformers and simpler networks, in human action recognition tasks.

Method: Used a three-class subset of the COCO image corpus, testing models like fully connected networks, convolutional networks, CLIP-based models, and Vision Transformers (ViT). Statistical analysis (ANOVA) and explainability tools (SHAP, LeGrad) were applied.

Result: The binary ViT achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly outperforming other models (35% for CNNs, 62-64% for CLIP). Statistical significance was confirmed (F = 61.37, p < 0.001). Explainability tools showed ViT's focus on pose-specific regions.

Conclusion: Transformers like ViT are more data-efficient and accurate for action recognition, with explainability techniques crucial for diagnosing model failures.

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

TL;DR: MTabVQA is a new benchmark for multi-tabular visual question answering, addressing gaps in existing VLMs' ability to reason across multiple table images. It includes 3,745 complex questions and shows performance improvements via fine-tuning with MTabVQA-Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess VLMs' ability to parse and reason across diverse table images, a common real-world scenario.

Method: Introduces MTabVQA, a benchmark with multi-tabular visual questions, and MTabVQA-Instruct, a dataset for instruction-tuning VLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs show limitations on MTabVQA, but fine-tuning with MTabVQA-Instruct improves performance.

Conclusion: MTabVQA fills a critical gap in evaluating VLMs for multi-tabular reasoning, and instruction-tuning enhances their capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

TL;DR: DMAF-Net addresses modality imbalance in multi-modal medical image segmentation by dynamically balancing contributions and leveraging structural relationships between modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in real-world scenarios due to idealized assumptions of complete modality availability, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: DMAF-Net uses a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion module, a synergistic distillation framework, and a Dynamic Training Monitoring strategy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020 datasets.

Conclusion: DMAF-Net effectively handles incomplete multi-modal data, improving segmentation performance in clinical settings.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while maintaining computational efficiency in VSR.

Method: Proposes MambaVSR with Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS) for dynamic spatiotemporal interactions, and Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) for integrating global dependencies with local details.

Result: Outperforms Transformer-based methods by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MambaVSR is an efficient and superior framework for VSR, leveraging state-space models and innovative mechanisms for spatiotemporal modeling.

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

### [204] [CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11772)
*Byeongchan Lee, John Won, Seunghyun Lee, Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION combines discriminative (CLIP) and generative (diffusion) models for anomaly detection, excelling in capturing global and local features, outperforming baselines on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is challenging due to ambiguous definitions, diverse anomaly types, and scarce training data, requiring a model that captures both low-level and high-level features.

Method: CLIPFUSION integrates CLIP for global features and diffusion models for local details, using cross-attention and feature maps for anomaly detection.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets in anomaly segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: CLIPFUSION demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-modal, multi-model fusion for anomaly detection, offering a scalable real-world solution.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

*Zikang Leng, Megha Thukral, Yaqi Liu, Hrudhai Rajasekhar, Shruthi K. Hiremath, Thomas Plötz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgentSense uses virtual personas and simulated environments to generate diverse HAR datasets, improving model performance with limited real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of diverse, labeled datasets in HAR due to variability in home layouts and user behavior.

Method: Leveraging LLMs to create diverse personas, decompose routines into actions, and simulate activities in VirtualHome with virtual sensors.

Result: Virtual data combined with minimal real data matches performance of models trained on full real datasets.

Conclusion: AgentSense proves virtual data can overcome HAR's data scarcity without manual collection.

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

*Abhishek Jaiswal, Armeet Singh Luthra, Purav Jangir, Bhavya Garg, Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time feedback system for isometric exercises is introduced to address risks like incorrect posture and injury, supported by a large dataset and novel evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks from unreliable digital media in isometric training, such as injuries and lack of feedback, by providing expert-level supervision.

Method: Developed a real-time feedback system, created a large multiclass isometric exercise dataset, and benchmarked state-of-the-art models with a novel three-part metric.

Result: Enhanced feasibility of intelligent, personalized home workout systems with applications in rehabilitation and physiotherapy.

Conclusion: The system offers expert-level feedback, improving safety and effectiveness of isometric exercises for home users.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

*Divyanshu Mishra, Mohammadreza Salehi, Pramit Saha, Olga Patey, Aris T. Papageorghiou, Yuki M. Asano, J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISCOVR is a self-supervised dual-branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning, combining temporal dynamics and spatial semantics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in echocardiography (e.g., subtle structures, low PSNR) limit SSL effectiveness; existing methods struggle with intersample similarity or distort clinical features.

Method: DISCOVR uses a clustering-based video encoder for temporal dynamics and an online image encoder for spatial semantics, connected via semantic cluster distillation.

Result: Outperforms video anomaly detection and SSL baselines in zero-shot, linear probing, and segmentation tasks across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: DISCOVR advances SSL for echocardiography by integrating temporal and spatial learning, improving representation quality and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

### [208] [GPLQ: A General, Practical, and Lightning QAT Method for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11784)
*Guang Liang, Xinyao Liu, Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ introduces a fast, efficient 4-bit quantization method for Vision Transformers, addressing PTQ and QAT limitations with a two-stage approach, achieving competitive accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ and QAT methods for ViT quantization have significant drawbacks: PTQ causes accuracy drops, while QAT is computationally expensive and lacks generalization.

Method: GPLQ uses a two-stage strategy: Stage 1 quantizes activations while keeping weights in FP32, preserving the optimization 'basin'; Stage 2 quantizes weights using PTQ.

Result: GPLQ is 100x faster than QAT, reduces memory usage below FP32, and achieves 4-bit performance competitive with FP32 models on ImageNet and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: GPLQ provides a practical, efficient solution for ViT quantization, balancing speed, accuracy, and generalization, with plans for an open-source toolkit.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

*Xintong Wang, Jingheng Pan, Yixiao Liu, Xiaohu Zhao, Chenyang Lyu, Minghao Wu, Chris Biemann, Longyue Wang, Linlong Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision-Language Translation (VLT) using large vision-language models (LVLMs), addressing data quality, model architecture, and evaluation metrics. It introduces a new dataset (AibTrans), benchmarks models, and proposes a robust evaluation metric (DA Score).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic evaluation of LVLMs on VLT tasks, despite their multilingual and visual capabilities. The study aims to fill this gap.

Method: The study evaluates VLT through three lenses: (1) data quality (introducing AibTrans), (2) model architecture (benchmarking 17 models), and (3) evaluation metrics (proposing DA Score).

Result: Findings include OCR dependency in models, degradation of cross-lingual performance with fine-tuning, and the effectiveness of balanced multilingual fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a new VLT benchmark and highlights the need for balanced fine-tuning to maintain LVLM generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cost-effective 3D object detection pipeline using only cameras, leveraging 2D CNN for point cloud processing, achieving competitive results with lower runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cheaper alternative to LiDAR-based 3D object detection by utilizing existing onboard cameras and focusing on all road users.

Method: Lifts 2D vision-based algorithm results to 3D using cameras, employing a 2D CNN for point cloud processing to minimize computational effort.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art image-based methods on the KITTI benchmark with significantly reduced runtime (one-third).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers a viable, cost-effective solution for 3D object detection in autonomous driving, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

*Zhiao Feng, Xuewei Li, Junjie Yang, Yuxin Peng, Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereDrag is a novel framework for panoramic image editing, addressing challenges like boundary discontinuity and uneven pixel density using spherical geometry. It outperforms existing methods by 10.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image editing is underexplored due to spherical geometry and projection distortions, posing challenges like boundary discontinuity and uneven pixel density.

Method: SphereDrag uses adaptive reprojection (AR) for discontinuity, great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) for accurate movement, and spherical search region tracking (SSRT) for pixel density. PanoBench is introduced as a benchmark.

Result: SphereDrag improves geometric consistency and image quality by up to 10.5% over existing methods.

Conclusion: SphereDrag effectively addresses panoramic editing challenges, demonstrating superior performance and providing a standardized benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

*F. Gao, Y Li, X He, J Sun, J Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O2Former, an instance segmentation framework for SAR ship imagery, improves performance by addressing scale variation, object density, and fuzzy boundaries with optimized query generation and orientation-aware embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook challenges like scale variation, object density, and fuzzy boundaries in SAR ship imagery, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: O2Former extends Mask2Former with an Optimized Query Generator (OQG) for multi-scale feature interaction and an Orientation-Aware Embedding Module (OAEM) for directional sensitivity.

Result: O2Former outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in SAR ship instance segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses SAR-specific challenges and demonstrates strong generalization on ship datasets.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for novel view image and geometry generation using warping-and-inpainting, with cross-modal attention distillation for alignment and proximity-based mesh conditioning for robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require dense posed images or are limited to in-domain views; this work aims to leverage off-the-shelf geometry predictors for more flexible and accurate novel-view synthesis.

Method: Uses warping-and-inpainting for image and geometry generation, cross-modal attention distillation for alignment, and proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis, competitive reconstruction quality, and geometrically aligned colored point clouds for 3D completion.

Conclusion: The method is effective for robust novel-view synthesis and geometry prediction, with applications in comprehensive 3D completion.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

TL;DR: A smartphone-based deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm was compared to a commercial infrared tracker (Tobii Pro Nano), showing similar accuracy but higher sensitivity to factors like lighting, age, and vision correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of appearance-based gaze estimation in realistic mobile conditions and compare it to a commercial solution.

Method: Used a lightweight CNN (MobileNet-V3) with LSTM to predict gaze from grayscale facial images, tested on 51 participants with dynamic stimuli. Accuracy measured via Euclidean distance.

Result: Mean error: 17.76 mm (deep learning) vs. 16.53 mm (Tobii). Higher sensitivity to lighting, glasses, age, and device/positional factors.

Conclusion: Appearance-based methods show promise for mobile eye tracking but require optimization for real-world variability.

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

*Constantin Venhoff, Ashkan Khakzar, Sonia Joseph, Philip Torr, Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework aligns visual and linguistic representations in VLMs using a frozen LLM and ViT, connected by a linear adapter, revealing layer-wise alignment progression via SAE analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLMs align visual and linguistic representations without fine-tuning the language model, preserving its original language features.

Method: Uses a frozen LLM and ViT with a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning, analyzing alignment via pre-trained SAEs as probes.

Result: Visual representations align with language features in middle-to-later layers, indicating misalignment in early layers.

Conclusion: Current adapter-based architectures may not optimally facilitate cross-modal learning, raising questions about their design.

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

TL;DR: A lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework improves radiology report generation by integrating medical priors and dynamically adjusting inference depth, outperforming baselines without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning performance of vision-language large models (VLLMs) for radiology report generation without additional training.

Method: Introduces TGT framework with structured medical priors and a reasoning budget forcing strategy to dynamically extend inference depth.

Result: Outperforms baseline prompting methods, generates more accurate reports, and reveals dataset biases.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling with TGT and dynamic inference depth improves VLLM performance in radiology report generation, offering reproducibility and traceable reasoning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

### [217] [VGR: Visual Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11991)
*Jiacong Wang, Zijiang Kang, Haochen Wang, Haiyong Jiang, Jiawen Li, Bohong Wu, Ya Wang, Jiao Ran, Xiao Liang, Chao Feng, Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGR is a multimodal reasoning model that enhances visual perception for complex tasks by detecting relevant image regions and integrating them into reasoning, outperforming baselines with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT reasoning methods are language-biased and limited to math/science, lacking visual detail understanding. VGR addresses this by improving fine-grained visual perception.

Method: VGR detects relevant image regions, replays them for reasoning, and uses a custom SFT dataset (VGR-SFT) with vision grounding and language deduction.

Result: VGR outperforms LLaVA-NeXT-7B, achieving +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and +12.9 on ChartQA, using 30% fewer image tokens.

Conclusion: VGR advances multimodal reasoning by integrating visual regions, demonstrating superior performance in tasks requiring detailed image understanding.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if automated CT scan analysis of body composition can improve postoperative outcome predictions beyond existing clinical risk scores.

Method: Used Cox proportional hazards model for 1-year mortality (C-index, IBS) and logistic regression for secondary outcomes (AUC, Brier Score). Extracted over 300 CT features (muscle, fat metrics) and combined with NSQIP scores.

Result: Predictive performance was evaluated for mortality and complications, with associations described via odds ratios.

Conclusion: CT-derived body composition metrics show promise in enhancing postoperative outcome predictions, potentially improving risk stratification.

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

*Junha Lee, Eunha Park, Chunghyun Park, Dahyun Kang, Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Affogato introduces a large-scale benchmark for affordance grounding, addressing challenges like fine-grained localization and dataset scarcity, and proposes effective vision-language models for the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of affordance grounding is critical for intelligent agents but remains challenging due to fine-grained localization needs, ambiguity in interaction regions, and lack of large-scale datasets.

Method: The work introduces the Affogato dataset (150K instances) and develops vision-language models using pretrained part-aware vision backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder.

Result: Models trained with Affogato perform well on 2D and 3D benchmarks and show strong open-vocabulary cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Affogato provides a valuable benchmark and effective models for affordance grounding, with public dataset availability.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

*Zixun Jiao, Xihan Wang, Zhaoqiang Xia, Lianhe Shao, Quanli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HandS3C is a novel 3D hand mesh reconstruction network using a state-space spatial-channel attention module for efficient and detailed reconstruction from single RGB images, even under occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hands are often occluded in images, making 3D reconstruction challenging. Existing methods improve performance but increase computational complexity. HandS3C aims to balance performance and efficiency.

Method: Incorporates a state-space model for the first time in hand mesh reconstruction, featuring a spatial-channel attention module to enhance receptive fields and feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: HandS3C offers an efficient and effective solution for 3D hand mesh reconstruction, even in occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstructing the hand mesh from one single RGB image is a challenging task
because hands are often occluded by other objects. Most previous works attempt
to explore more additional information and adopt attention mechanisms for
improving 3D reconstruction performance, while it would increase computational
complexity simultaneously. To achieve a performance-reserving architecture with
high computational efficiency, in this work, we propose a simple but effective
3D hand mesh reconstruction network (i.e., HandS3C), which is the first time to
incorporate state space model into the task of hand mesh reconstruction. In the
network, we design a novel state-space spatial-channel attention module that
extends the effective receptive field, extracts hand features in the spatial
dimension, and enhances regional features of hands in the channel dimension.
This helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive
experiments conducted on well-known datasets facing heavy occlusions (such as
FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandS3C achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameters.

TL;DR: MiniMaxAD is an efficient autoencoder for anomaly detection in feature-rich datasets, using large kernel convolution and adaptive loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of handling stylistically diverse and feature-rich samples in industrial anomaly detection.

Method: Developed MiniMaxAD, an autoencoder with large kernel convolution and Adaptive Contraction Hard Mining Loss (ADCLoss) for feature-rich datasets.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: MiniMaxAD effectively unifies diverse datasets under a feature-rich anomaly detection framework with significant benefits.

Abstract: Previous industrial anomaly detection methods often struggle to handle the
extensive diversity in training sets, particularly when they contain
stylistically diverse and feature-rich samples, which we categorize as
feature-rich anomaly detection datasets (FRADs). This challenge is evident in
applications such as multi-view and multi-class scenarios. To address this
challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a efficient autoencoder designed to
efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our
model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing
the effective capacity of the network. It also utilizes large kernel
convolution to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient
and compact feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction
Hard Mining Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs. In our methodology,
any dataset can be unified under the framework of feature-rich anomaly
detection, in a way that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Our approach
has achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple challenging benchmarks.

*Lingshun Kong, Jiangxin Dong, Jinhui Tang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EVSSM, a visual state space model for image deblurring, combining SSMs with efficient geometric transformations and a frequency-based feedforward network to outperform CNNs and ViTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs outperform CNNs in image restoration but suffer from high computational complexity at high resolutions, limiting practical use.

Method: EVSSM uses an efficient visual scan block with geometric transformations and an EDFFN for frequency domain-based local information capture.

Result: EVSSM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks and real-world images.

Conclusion: EVSSM is a simple, effective solution for high-resolution image deblurring, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
achieved excellent performance in image restoration. While ViTs generally
outperform CNNs by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and
input-specific characteristics, their computational complexity increases
quadratically with image resolution. This limitation hampers their practical
application in high-resolution image restoration. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring,
leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) for visual data. In
contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for
feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we
develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric
transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local
information and maintaining high efficiency. In addition, to more effectively
capture and represent local information, we propose an efficient discriminative
frequency domain-based feedforward network (EDFFN), which can effectively
estimate useful frequency information for latent clear image restoration.
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably
against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and real-world images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPoseDiv diversifies human poses in synthetic datasets for aerial-view human detection, improving detection accuracy, especially in low-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of creating diverse, realistic human poses in synthetic datasets for aerial-view human detection.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based pose generator and a source-to-target image translator, with pose sequences optimized via Dijkstra's algorithm.

Result: Significantly improves detection accuracy across benchmarks, particularly in low-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: SynPoseDiv is effective regardless of training approach or dataset size, enhancing synthetic data utility.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to the data
scarcity issue in aerial-view human detection. However, creating datasets that
accurately reflect varying real-world human appearances, particularly diverse
poses, remains challenging and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose
SynPoseDiv, a novel framework that diversifies human poses within existing
synthetic datasets. SynPoseDiv tackles two key challenges: generating
realistic, diverse 3D human poses using a diffusion-based pose generator, and
producing images of virtual characters in novel poses through a
source-to-target image translator. The framework incrementally transitions
characters into new poses using optimized pose sequences identified via
Dijkstra's algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that SynPoseDiv significantly
improves detection accuracy across multiple aerial-view human detection
benchmarks, especially in low-shot scenarios, and remains effective regardless
of the training approach or dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces E2MPL, a framework for few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation (FS-UDA), leveraging CLIP for feature learning, domain-shared prompts, and task-specific prompts to improve stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instability and inefficiency in current FS-UDA methods when adapting to new tasks.

Method: Uses CLIP as backbone, designs domain-shared prompts, task-specific prompt learning, and bilevel optimization for meta-prompt learning.

Result: Achieves 15.4% higher accuracy and 68.5% faster in 5-way 1-shot tasks, and 8.7% higher accuracy with 74.1% faster in 5-way 5-shot tasks on DomainNet.

Conclusion: E2MPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, speed, and stability across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation (FS-UDA) leverages a limited amount
of labeled data from a source domain to enable accurate classification in an
unlabeled target domain. Despite recent advancements, current approaches of
FS-UDA continue to confront a major challenge: models often demonstrate
instability when adapted to new FS-UDA tasks and necessitate considerable time
investment. To address these challenges, we put forward a novel framework
called Enduring and Efficient Meta-Prompt Learning (E2MPL) for FS-UDA. Within
this framework, we utilize the pre-trained CLIP model as the backbone of
feature learning. Firstly, we design domain-shared prompts, consisting of
virtual tokens, which primarily capture meta-knowledge from a wide range of
meta-tasks to mitigate the domain gaps. Secondly, we develop a task prompt
learning network that adaptively learns task-specific specific prompts with the
goal of achieving fast and stable task generalization. Thirdly, we formulate
the meta-prompt learning process as a bilevel optimization problem, consisting
of (outer) meta-prompt learner and (inner) task-specific classifier and domain
adapter. Also, the inner objective of each meta-task has the closed-form
solution, which enables efficient prompt learning and adaptation to new tasks
in a single step. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the promising
performance of our framework in a domain adaptation benchmark dataset
DomainNet. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method has improved
accuracy by at least 15.4% and reduced the time by 68.5% on average in 5-way
1-shot tasks, and improved accuracy by 8.7% and reduced the time by 74.1% on
average in 5-way 5-shot tasks. Moreover, our approach exhibits more enduring
performance than the other methods, i.e., being more stable across 3600 test
tasks.

*Zhemin Zhang, Xun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to neural network design by modeling image representation learning through the heat conduction equation, leading to interpretable architectures like the Heat Conduction Layer and Refinement Approximation Layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of general guidance for model architecture design in image representation learning inspired the authors to explore the analogy between image features and heat conduction.

Method: The authors model image features as temperatures and their interactions as thermal energy diffusion, deriving architectures like the Heat Conduction Layer and Refinement Approximation Layer from the heat conduction equation.

Result: The proposed Heat Conduction Network (HcNet) achieves competitive performance, e.g., 83.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 28M parameters and 4.1G MACs.

Conclusion: The paper successfully integrates neural network design into the theoretical framework of heat conduction, offering interpretable and efficient models.

Abstract: Foundation models, such as CNNs and ViTs, have powered the development of
image representation learning. However, general guidance to model architecture
design is still missing. Inspired by the connection between image
representation learning and heat conduction, we model images by the heat
conduction equation, where the essential idea is to conceptualize image
features as temperatures and model their information interaction as the
diffusion of thermal energy. Based on this idea, we find that many modern model
architectures, such as residual structures, SE block, and feed-forward
networks, can be interpreted from the perspective of the heat conduction
equation. Therefore, we leverage the heat equation to design new and more
interpretable models. As an example, we propose the Heat Conduction Layer and
the Refinement Approximation Layer inspired by solving the heat conduction
equation using Finite Difference Method and Fourier series, respectively. The
main goal of this paper is to integrate the overall architectural design of
neural networks into the theoretical framework of heat conduction.
Nevertheless, our Heat Conduction Network (HcNet) still shows competitive
performance, e.g., HcNet-T achieves 83.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K while
only requiring 28M parameters and 4.1G MACs. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: MultiCamCows2024 is a dataset for cow identification using coat patterns, achieving 96% accuracy with multi-camera and self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automatic cattle identification for livestock management without human labeling.

Method: Uses supervised and self-supervised learning on cow tracklets from multi-camera footage.

Result: 96% single-image identification accuracy; multi-camera data enhances self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: Efficient, accurate cow identification without human labeling, benefiting livestock management.

Abstract: We present MultiCamCows2024, a farm-scale image dataset filmed across
multiple cameras for the biometric identification of individual
Holstein-Friesian cattle exploiting their unique black and white coat-patterns.
Captured by three ceiling-mounted visual sensors covering adjacent barn areas
over seven days on a working dairy farm, the dataset comprises 101,329 images
of 90 cows, plus underlying original CCTV footage. The dataset is provided with
full computer vision recognition baselines, that is both a supervised and
self-supervised learning framework for individual cow identification trained on
cattle tracklets. We report a performance above 96% single image identification
accuracy from the dataset and demonstrate that combining data from multiple
cameras during learning enhances self-supervised identification. We show that
our framework enables automatic cattle identification, barring only the simple
human verification of tracklet integrity during data collection. Crucially, our
study highlights that multi-camera, supervised and self-supervised components
in tandem not only deliver highly accurate individual cow identification, but
also achieve this efficiently with no labelling of cattle identities by humans.
We argue that this improvement in efficacy has practical implications for
livestock management, behaviour analysis, and agricultural monitoring. For
reproducibility and practical ease of use, we publish all key software and code
including re-identification components and the species detector with this

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrugalNeRF improves few-shot NeRF performance by using weight-sharing voxels and cross-scale geometric adaptation, reducing training time and avoiding overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF struggles with overfitting and long training in few-shot scenarios; existing methods like FreeNeRF and SparseNeRF have limitations with scheduling and bias.

Method: FrugalNeRF uses weight-sharing voxels and a cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme to select pseudo ground truth depth, avoiding reliance on external priors.

Result: Outperforms other few-shot NeRF methods on LLFF, DTU, and RealEstate-10K datasets, with faster training.

Conclusion: FrugalNeRF is a practical, efficient solution for accurate 3D scene reconstruction in few-shot settings.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) face significant challenges in extreme few-shot
scenarios, primarily due to overfitting and long training times. Existing
methods, such as FreeNeRF and SparseNeRF, use frequency regularization or
pre-trained priors but struggle with complex scheduling and bias. We introduce
FrugalNeRF, a novel few-shot NeRF framework that leverages weight-sharing
voxels across multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details. Our key
contribution is a cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme that selects pseudo
ground truth depth based on reprojection errors across scales. This guides
training without relying on externally learned priors, enabling full
utilization of the training data. It can also integrate pre-trained priors,
enhancing quality without slowing convergence. Experiments on LLFF, DTU, and
RealEstate-10K show that FrugalNeRF outperforms other few-shot NeRF methods
while significantly reducing training time, making it a practical solution for
efficient and accurate 3D scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: RF-Solver improves inversion precision in rectified-flow-based models, and RF-Edit enhances image/video editing by sharing features, both without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified-flow models like FLUX and OpenSora face inversion inaccuracies, limiting their effectiveness in tasks like editing.

Method: RF-Solver uses high-order Taylor expansion to refine ODE-solving in rectified flow. RF-Edit leverages self-attention features for editing.

Result: Improved inversion precision and high-quality editing results in image/video tasks.

Conclusion: RF-Solver and RF-Edit offer a versatile, training-free solution for enhancing rectified-flow models.

Abstract: Rectified-flow-based diffusion transformers like FLUX and OpenSora have
demonstrated outstanding performance in the field of image and video
generation. Despite their robust generative capabilities, these models often
struggle with inversion inaccuracies, which could further limit their
effectiveness in downstream tasks such as image and video editing. To address
this issue, we propose RF-Solver, a novel training-free sampler that
effectively enhances inversion precision by mitigating the errors in the
ODE-solving process of rectified flow. Specifically, we derive the exact
formulation of the rectified flow ODE and apply the high-order Taylor expansion
to estimate its nonlinear components, significantly enhancing the precision of
ODE solutions at each timestep. Building upon RF-Solver, we further propose
RF-Edit, a general feature-sharing-based framework for image and video editing.
By incorporating self-attention features from the inversion process into the
editing process, RF-Edit effectively preserves the structural information of
the source image or video while achieving high-quality editing results. Our
approach is compatible with any pre-trained rectified-flow-based models for
image and video tasks, requiring no additional training or optimization.
Extensive experiments across generation, inversion, and editing tasks in both
image and video modalities demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our
method. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 3D-WAG is an autoregressive model for 3D shape generation using wavelet token maps and Transformers, offering efficiency and controllability over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are efficient for 3D shape modeling but face challenges with computational cost and scalability. 3D-WAG addresses these by redefining the task as "next-scale" prediction.

Method: 3D-WAG encodes shapes as multi-scale wavelet token maps and uses a Transformer to predict higher-resolution token maps autoregressively.

Result: 3D-WAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like Coverage and MMD, generating high-fidelity 3D shapes.

Conclusion: 3D-WAG provides a scalable, efficient, and high-quality solution for 3D shape generation, overcoming limitations of traditional autoregressive approaches.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable success in natural
language and image generation, but their application to 3D shape modeling
remains largely unexplored. Unlike diffusion models, AR models enable more
efficient and controllable generation with faster inference times, making them
especially suitable for data-intensive domains. Traditional 3D generative
models using AR approaches often rely on ``next-token" predictions at the voxel
or point level. While effective for certain applications, these methods can be
restrictive and computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale 3D
data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3D-WAG, an AR model for 3D
implicit distance fields that can perform unconditional shape generation,
class-conditioned and also text-conditioned shape generation. Our key idea is
to encode shapes as multi-scale wavelet token maps and use a Transformer to
predict the ``next higher-resolution token map" in an autoregressive manner. By
redefining 3D AR generation task as ``next-scale" prediction, we reduce the
computational cost of generation compared to traditional ``next-token"
prediction models, while preserving essential geometric details of 3D shapes in
a more structured and hierarchical manner. We evaluate 3D-WAG to showcase its
benefit by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art
methods on widely used benchmarks. Our results show 3D-WAG achieves superior
performance in key metrics like Coverage and MMD, generating high-fidelity 3D
shapes that closely match the real data distribution.

TL;DR: A study explores if a computational model mimicking infant learning can develop visual concepts beyond its training vocabulary, analyzing a model trained on infant data and comparing it to modern computer vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding infant visual development could enhance computer vision by replicating natural learning processes.

Method: Analyzes a model trained on longitudinal infant data, performs neuron labeling to identify hidden visual concepts, and compares it to models like CLIP and ImageNet.

Result: The model's neurons recognize objects beyond its original vocabulary, revealing differences from standard computer vision models.

Conclusion: The work connects cognitive science and computer vision by studying internal representations of infant-inspired models.

Abstract: Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding the
acquisition of linguistic skills. As computer vision seeks to replicate the
human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable
insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this
question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process
develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard,
similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a
recently published model in Science by Vong et al., which is trained on
longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed
parental speech. We perform neuron labeling to identify visual concept neurons
hidden in the model's internal representations. We then demonstrate that these
neurons can recognize objects beyond the model's original vocabulary.
Furthermore, we compare the differences in representation between infant models
and those in modern computer vision models, such as CLIP and ImageNet
pre-trained model. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer
vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model
trained on an infant visual and linguistic inputs. Project page is available at

*Xuzheng Yang, Junzhuo Liu, Peng Wang, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new REC dataset with controllable difficulty and negative examples, proposing two methods combining Specialist Models and MLLMs for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing REC datasets and leverage the strengths of both Specialist Models and MLLMs for fine-grained reasoning.

Method: 1. Adaptive assignment of cases to lightweight or MLLMs. 2. Specialist generates regions, MLLM selects the most plausible.

Result: Significant improvements on the new dataset and benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining specialized and general-purpose models.

Conclusion: Combining Specialist Models and MLLMs is a practical approach for complex vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task
that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension,
and language-to-image grounding. It serves as an essential testing ground for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To advance this field, we introduced
a new REC dataset in our previous conference paper, characterized by two key
features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring
multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and
multi-hop relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images
generated through fine-grained editing and augmentation, explicitly testing a
model's ability to reject scenarios where the target object is absent, an often
overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. In this extended work,
we propose two new methods to tackle the challenges of fine-grained REC by
combining the strengths of Specialist Models and MLLMs. The first method
adaptively assigns simple cases to faster, lightweight models and reserves
complex ones for powerful MLLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The second
method lets a specialist generate a set of possible object regions, and the
MLLM selects the most plausible one using its reasoning ability. These
collaborative strategies lead to significant improvements on our dataset and
other challenging benchmarks. Our results show that combining specialized and
general-purpose models offers a practical path toward solving complex
real-world vision-language tasks. Our dataset and code are available at

### [235] [A Self-supervised Motion Representation for Portrait Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10096)
*Qiyuan Zhang, Chenyu Wu, Wenzhang Sun, Huaize Liu, Donglin Di, Wei Chen, Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact motion representation for portrait video generation, addressing issues of unrealistic motion and inefficient inference in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on human priors or pre-trained models, leading to unrealistic motion or inefficiency. SeMo aims to provide a better solution.

Method: SeMo uses a three-step framework: Abstraction (compressing motion into 1D tokens), Reasoning (generating motion from audio), and Generation (synthesizing video).

Result: SeMo achieves high-quality video generation with 81% win rate in realism and strong compression/reconstruction capabilities.

Conclusion: SeMo is an efficient and effective solution for portrait video generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy.
However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained
generative models, Motion representations based on human priors may introduce
unrealistic motion, while methods relying on pre-trained generative models
often suffer from inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion
representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both
high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective
three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the
Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Masked Motion Encoder, which
leverages a self-supervised learning paradigm to compress the subject's motion
state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the
Reasoning step, we efficiently generate motion sequences based on the driving
audio signal. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as
conditional information to guide the motion decoder in synthesizing realistic
transitions from reference frame to target video. Thanks to the compact and
expressive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method achieves efficient
motion representation and high-quality video generation. User studies
demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win
rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression
capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential.

It outperforms supervised methods on benchmarks like SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, runs in real-time on a CPU, and ranks first on the SemanticKITTI leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and time required for manual instance annotations in LiDAR point clouds is a bottleneck. The paper aims to achieve competitive panoptic segmentation without instance labels.

Method: The method predicts instances without training or annotations, using only semantic labels. It is explainable, requires no learning or parameter tuning, and integrates with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved without instance labels, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for outdoor scene understanding.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds is fundamental to outdoor scene
understanding, with autonomous driving being a primary application. While
state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on end-to-end deep learning
architectures and extensive manual annotations of instances, the significant
cost and time investment required for labeling large-scale point cloud datasets
remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, we demonstrate that
competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved using only semantic labels,
with instances predicted without any training or annotations. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks
including SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and outperforms every publicly available
method on SemanticKITTI as a drop-in instance head replacement, while running
in real-time on a single-threaded CPU and requiring no instance labels. It is
fully explainable, and requires no learning or parameter tuning. Alpine
combined with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation ranks first on the
official panoptic segmentation leaderboard of SemanticKITTI. Code is available

TL;DR: Llama3-MS-CLIP is a vision-language model leveraging multispectral data, outperforming RGB-based models in classification and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EO models use only visual spectrum data, missing the potential of multispectral channels.

Method: Pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset, using a scalable captioning pipeline.

Result: Improves classification accuracy by +6.77% and retrieval by +4.63% mAP over RGB models.

Conclusion: Multispectral vision-language learning is highly effective, with released dataset, code, and model weights.

Abstract: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the
visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the
rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by
satellites. Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language
model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral
dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range.
Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for
multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and
corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and
Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is
validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral
zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying
complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly
outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by
+6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the
second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral

*Yun Zhu, Le Hui, Hang Yang, Jianjun Qian, Jin Xie, Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified sparse supervised 3D object detection method for indoor and outdoor scenes using class prototypes to mine unlabeled objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse supervised 3D object detection methods focus only on outdoor scenes, neglecting indoor settings. This work aims to bridge the gap by proposing a unified approach for both environments.

Method: The method includes a prototype-based object mining module for matching unlabeled features to class prototypes and a multi-label cooperative refinement module to recover missed detections.

Result: Achieves 78%, 90%, and 96% performance of fully supervised detectors on ScanNet V2, SUN RGB-D, and KITTI datasets, respectively, with only one labeled object per scene.

Conclusion: The proposed method is scalable and effective for sparse supervised 3D object detection in both indoor and outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Both indoor and outdoor scene perceptions are essential for embodied
intelligence. However, current sparse supervised 3D object detection methods
focus solely on outdoor scenes without considering indoor settings. To this
end, we propose a unified sparse supervised 3D object detection method for both
indoor and outdoor scenes through learning class prototypes to effectively
utilize unlabeled objects. Specifically, we first propose a prototype-based
object mining module that converts the unlabeled object mining into a matching
problem between class prototypes and unlabeled features. By using optimal
transport matching results, we assign prototype labels to high-confidence
features, thereby achieving the mining of unlabeled objects. We then present a
multi-label cooperative refinement module to effectively recover missed
detections through pseudo label quality control and prototype label
cooperation. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under the one object per scene sparse supervised setting across
indoor and outdoor datasets. With only one labeled object per scene, our method
achieves about 78%, 90%, and 96% performance compared to the fully supervised
detector on ScanNet V2, SUN RGB-D, and KITTI, respectively, highlighting the
scalability of our method. Code is available at

Result: TextCrafter outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively reducing text confusion, omissions, and blurriness.

Conclusion: TextCrafter and CVTG-2K dataset advance CVTG by improving text rendering and evaluation.

Abstract: This paper explores the task of Complex Visual Text Generation (CVTG), which
centers on generating intricate textual content distributed across diverse
regions within visual images. In CVTG, image generation models often rendering
distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these
challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method.
TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text
into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual
content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus
enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the
generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG
tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present
a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the
performance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: ColorBench evaluates VLMs' color understanding, revealing gaps and the need for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess VLMs' ability to perceive, understand, and leverage color like humans.

Method: Introduces ColorBench, a benchmark with diverse test scenarios, evaluating 32 VLMs.

Result: Key findings: scaling law holds, language models matter more, performance gaps are small, CoT helps, and color clues can mislead.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack robust color understanding; ColorBench aids future research.

Abstract: Color plays an important role in human perception and usually provides
critical clues in visual reasoning. However, it is unclear whether and how
vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as
humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously
crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including
color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse
test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how
these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and
maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an
extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision
encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law
(larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model
plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the
performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color
understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning
improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are
vision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on
ColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings
highlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to
enhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for
advancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI.

Motivation: Global decline of Posidonia oceanica meadows necessitates efficient monitoring tools, but underwater conditions challenge existing methods.

Method: Uses Mask R-CNN for image segmentation and introduces a rock class to enhance boundary tracking. Validated with real underwater images and simulations.

Result: The framework allows AUVs to autonomously inspect and segment rocks, aiding meadow conservation.

Conclusion: This approach advances marine conservation by providing insights into meadow status and supporting preservation efforts.

Abstract: Posidonia oceanica meadows are a species of seagrass highly dependent on
rocks for their survival and conservation. In recent years, there has been a
concerning global decline in this species, emphasizing the critical need for
efficient monitoring and assessment tools. While deep learning-based semantic
segmentation and visual automated monitoring systems have shown promise in a
variety of applications, their performance in underwater environments remains
challenging due to complex water conditions and limited datasets. This paper
introduces a framework that combines machine learning and computer vision
techniques to enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to inspect the
boundaries of Posidonia oceanica meadows autonomously. The framework
incorporates an image segmentation module using an existing Mask R-CNN model
and a strategy for Posidonia oceanica meadow boundary tracking. Furthermore, a
new class dedicated to rocks is introduced to enhance the existing model,
aiming to contribute to a comprehensive monitoring approach and provide a
deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between the meadow and its
surrounding environment. The image segmentation model is validated using real
underwater images, while the overall inspection framework is evaluated in a
realistic simulation environment, replicating actual monitoring scenarios with
real underwater images. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework
enables the AUV to autonomously accomplish the main tasks of underwater
inspection and segmentation of rocks. Consequently, this work holds significant
potential for the conservation and protection of marine environments, providing
valuable insights into the status of Posidonia oceanica meadows and supporting
targeted preservation efforts

Motivation: Large foundation models in Earth observation face challenges like high computational costs and feature forgetting during fine-tuning, limiting accessibility and scalability.

Method: Extensive experiments with various foundation model architectures and PEFT techniques on five EO datasets, evaluating performance, generalization, and resource efficiency.

Result: PEFT techniques match or exceed full fine-tuning performance, improve generalization to unseen regions, and reduce training time and memory. UNet decoders and no metadata fine-tuning are recommended.

Conclusion: PEFT is a viable solution for efficient model adaptation in EO, integrated into the open-source TerraTorch package for scalable and cost-effective use.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is crucial for monitoring environmental changes,
responding to disasters, and managing natural resources. In this context,
foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant
geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in
size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated
computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and
scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained
features and even degrade model generalization. To address this,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution.
In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model
architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five
different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering
insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained
geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed
full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen
geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements.
Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as
the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and
fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have
integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source
package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model
adaptation.

TL;DR: HF-VTON is a novel framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on, addressing geometric and semantic inconsistencies across poses with three specialized modules and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods struggle with geometric distortions, semantic mismatches, and loss of fine details across poses.

Method: HF-VTON includes APWAM for spatial alignment, SRCM for semantic representation, and MPAGM for appearance generation, alongside the SAMP-VTONS dataset.

Result: HF-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling in visual fidelity and consistency.

Conclusion: HF-VTON effectively addresses key challenges in virtual try-on, offering superior performance in detail preservation and consistency.

Abstract: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion
and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images
that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have
achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in
maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric
distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment
structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the
loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To
address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures
high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists
of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module
(APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric
deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation
and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes
and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural,
textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided
Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and
prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation,
ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome
data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset,
featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more
comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling
in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.

Motivation: Existing surgical simulation tools lack photorealism and human anatomy variability, and current generative models neglect fine-grained human control.

Method: SG2VID leverages Scene Graphs for precise video synthesis and human control, tested on cataract and cholecystectomy surgery datasets.

Result: SG2VID outperforms previous methods in quality and control, enabling accurate tool and anatomy manipulation, and improves downstream tasks like phase detection.

Conclusion: SG2VID advances surgical simulation by combining precise synthesis with human control, useful for training and rare scenario generation.

Abstract: Surgical simulation plays a pivotal role in training novice surgeons,
accelerating their learning curve and reducing intra-operative errors. However,
conventional simulation tools fall short in providing the necessary
photorealism and the variability of human anatomy. In response, current methods
are shifting towards generative model-based simulators. Yet, these approaches
primarily focus on using increasingly complex conditioning for precise
synthesis while neglecting the fine-grained human control aspect. To address
this gap, we introduce SG2VID, the first diffusion-based video model that
leverages Scene Graphs for both precise video synthesis and fine-grained human
control. We demonstrate SG2VID's capabilities across three public datasets
featuring cataract and cholecystectomy surgery. While SG2VID outperforms
previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, it also enables precise
synthesis, providing accurate control over tool and anatomy's size and
movement, entrance of new tools, as well as the overall scene layout. We
qualitatively motivate how SG2VID can be used for generative augmentation and
present an experiment demonstrating its ability to improve a downstream phase
detection task when the training set is extended with our synthetic videos.
Finally, to showcase SG2VID's ability to retain human control, we interact with
the Scene Graphs to generate new video samples depicting major yet rare
intra-operative irregularities.

### [248] [DualX-VSR: Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution without Motion Compensation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04830)
*Shuo Cao, Yihao Liu, Xiaohui Li, Yuanting Gao, Yu Zhou, Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualX-VSR introduces a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism for real-world video super-resolution, eliminating motion compensation and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based VSR models face challenges like pixel-level precision loss, restricted receptive fields, and reliance on optical flow, which limit real-world performance.

Method: Proposes DualX-VSR with a novel dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism, integrating spatial and temporal information orthogonally without motion compensation.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR tasks.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR offers a simplified, effective solution for real-world VSR by addressing limitations of existing transformer-based models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

### [249] [PATS: Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling for Multi-View Sports Skill Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04996)
*Edoardo Bianchi, Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATS is a novel temporal sampling method for sports skill assessment, preserving movement continuity and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts temporal continuity, hindering accurate skill assessment.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure full execution of critical movements, repeating across segments for coverage and coherence.

Result: PATS improves accuracy (+0.65% to +3.05%) and excels in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball).

Conclusion: PATS is an effective adaptive approach for automated skill assessment in diverse activities.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

*Mengya Xu, Zhongzhen Huang, Dillan Imans, Yiru Ye, Xiaofan Zhang, Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAP-Bench, a dataset for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in surgical action planning (SAP), highlighting gaps in current benchmarks and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate MLLMs for surgical action planning, a life-critical task requiring precision and reliability.

Method: SAP-Bench, a dataset of 1,226 clinically validated action clips from cholecystectomy procedures, is introduced. The MLLM-SAP framework leverages MLLMs for next-action recommendations.

Result: Evaluation of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant gaps in next-action prediction performance.

Conclusion: SAP-Bench addresses a critical need in MLLM evaluation for surgical planning, exposing limitations in current models.

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

*Zikang Leng, Archith Iyer, Thomas Plötz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares video-based and language-based virtual IMU data generation methods against traditional augmentation for HAR, showing virtual data outperforms real or augmented data, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of labeled HAR datasets by exploring virtual IMU data generation via cross-modality transfer.

Method: Direct comparison of video-based, language-based, and classical augmentation techniques, evaluated on benchmark datasets using four models.

Result: Virtual IMU data significantly improves HAR performance over real or augmented data, particularly in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies, highlighting pros and cons of each approach.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

### [252] [Consistent Video Editing as Flow-Driven Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07713)
*Ge Wang, Songlin Fan, Hangxu Liu, Quanjian Song, Hewei Wang, Jinfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowV2V improves video editing by using optical flows for motion modeling, ensuring temporal consistency and handling non-rigid motions better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods struggle with complex motion patterns and non-rigid object motions, limiting their applicability.

Method: FlowV2V decomposes video editing into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, using pseudo flow sequences for alignment.

Result: FlowV2V outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 13.67% and 50.66% improvements in DOVER and warping error metrics.

Conclusion: FlowV2V demonstrates superior performance in maintaining temporal consistency and quality, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

*Wenzhuo Liu, Fei Zhu, Haiyang Guo, Longhui Wei, Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-c improves LLaVA-1.5 with spectral-aware consolidation and unsupervised inquiry regularization for better task balance and general capability preservation in continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multitask learning (task balancing, expansion costs) and base model degradation in continual learning.

Method: Proposes spectral-aware consolidation and unsupervised inquiry regularization on LLaVA-1.5.

Result: LLaVA-c enhances benchmark performance and preserves general capabilities, matching/surpassing multitask joint learning.

Conclusion: Continual learning can rival multitask learning with proper modifications.

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual
understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling
strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask
learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment
of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic
forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising
alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing
capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance,
neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions,
which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but
effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware
consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization
to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific
performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments
demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance
and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that
task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass
multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

### [254] [SemanticSplat: Feed-Forward 3D Scene Understanding with Language-Aware Gaussian Fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09565)
*Qijing Li, Jingxiang Sun, Liang An, Zhaoqi Su, Hongwen Zhang, Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticSplat is a feed-forward method for holistic 3D scene understanding, unifying 3D Gaussians with semantic attributes to jointly model geometry, appearance, and semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack holistic scene comprehension, suffer from low-quality geometry, and require dense input views, limiting practicality.

Method: SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields with a cost volume representation and uses a two-stage distillation framework to reconstruct a multi-modal semantic feature field from sparse-view images.

Result: The method effectively performs tasks like promptable and open-vocabulary segmentation.

Conclusion: SemanticSplat advances 3D scene understanding by addressing limitations of prior methods and improving accuracy and coherence.

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance,
and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic
interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)
are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to
achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from
low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene
optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and
increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose
SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which
unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint
geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic
Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a
cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,
enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage
distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal
semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable
and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at

*Runqi Ouyang, Haoyun Li, Zhenyuan Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Guan Huang, Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 is a text-to-motion framework using Chain-of-Thought to improve semantic alignment and motion diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack deep linguistic understanding and logical reasoning, leading to inconsistent and less controllable motion generation.

Method: Motion-R1 decomposes text into structured action paths and uses Group Relative Policy Optimization for joint reasoning and motion synthesis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic understanding and long-term coherence.

Conclusion: Motion-R1 enhances motion generation by integrating logical reasoning and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

*Juan C. Martinez-Sevilla, Joan Cerveto-Serrano, Noelia Luna, Greg Chapman, Craig Sapp, David Rizo, Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB) dataset and the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED) metric for evaluating Optical Music Recognition (OMR) research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics in OMR research.

Method: Creation of the SMB dataset with diverse musical textures and development of the OMR-NED metric for detailed error analysis.

Result: SMB and OMR-NED provide a standardized framework for evaluating OMR performance, supported by baseline experiments.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in OMR evaluation, enabling better comparison and optimization of OMR methods.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Marzieh Oghbaie, Teresa Araújo, Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a prototype-based model using vision transformers to create interpretable prototypes for medical imaging, improving biomarker localization and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototype methods lack human-understandable visualizations and granularity for medical imaging, where biomarker extent is crucial.

Method: PiPViT uses vision transformers, contrastive learning, and multi-resolution processing to learn interpretable prototypes from image-level labels.

Result: PiPViT performs competitively on retinal OCT classification, providing clinically relevant explanations.

Conclusion: PiPViT enhances interpretability and assists clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQE-CLIP is a novel framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection in the medical domain, improving CLIP's adaptation with class-based and learnable prompts and an instance-aware query module for better anomaly sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for anomaly detection rely on scenario-specific prompts and lack effectiveness in distinguishing anomalies in joint embedding spaces, especially in medical tasks.

Method: Introduces class-based and learnable prompting tokens for CLIP adaptation and an instance-aware query module (IQM) to generate anomaly-sensitive query embeddings from text and visual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six medical datasets for zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in medical anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancements of vision-language models, such as CLIP,
leads to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD)
tasks. However, most existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods commonly assume prior
knowledge of categories and rely on carefully crafted prompts tailored to
specific scenarios. While such meticulously designed text prompts effectively
capture semantic information in the textual space, they fall short of
distinguishing normal and anomalous instances within the joint embedding space.
Moreover, these ZFSAD methods are predominantly explored in industrial
scenarios, with few efforts conducted to medical tasks. To this end, we propose
an innovative framework for ZFSAD tasks in medical domain, denoted as IQE-CLIP.
We reveal that query embeddings, which incorporate both textual and
instance-aware visual information, are better indicators for abnormalities.
Specifically, we first introduce class-based prompting tokens and learnable
prompting tokens for better adaptation of CLIP to the medical domain. Then, we
design an instance-aware query module (IQM) to extract region-level contextual
information from both text prompts and visual features, enabling the generation
of query embeddings that are more sensitive to anomalies. Extensive experiments
conducted on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We release
our code and data at https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/.

*Yuxuan Luo, Yuhui Yuan, Junwen Chen, Haonan Cai, Ziyi Yue, Yuwei Yang, Fatima Zohra Daha, Ji Li, Zhouhui Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces knowledge image generation as a new task and the MMMG benchmark to evaluate image generation models' reasoning. It highlights challenges in multimodal reasoning and presents a unified KG representation for evaluation. Results show significant deficits in current models, with GPT-4o scoring 50.20, and proposes FLUX-Reason as an open baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge images are vital for human learning, but generating them requires complex multimodal reasoning. Current models lack the capability to fuse world knowledge with visual grounding effectively.

Method: The paper introduces the MMMG benchmark with 4,456 expert-validated image-prompt pairs and a unified KG representation. It also proposes MMMG-Score for evaluation, combining factual fidelity and visual clarity.

Result: Evaluations of 16 models reveal serious reasoning deficits, with GPT-4o scoring 50.20. FLUX-Reason, a new baseline, scores 34.45.

Conclusion: The MMMG benchmark highlights the challenges in knowledge image generation and sets a foundation for future improvements, with FLUX-Reason as a starting point.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning -- a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits -- low entity fidelity,
weak relations, and clutter -- with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only
50.20, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we
release FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that
combines a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

TL;DR: This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) tasks, categorizing approaches by reasoning tasks, applications, and challenges, while also exploring advanced techniques like LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic review covering all KGR tasks, including downstream applications and challenging paradigms, and to highlight trends and future directions.

Method: Categorizes KGR approaches based on reasoning tasks, application tasks, and challenging tasks, and explores advanced techniques like LLMs.

Result: A detailed taxonomy of KGR tasks and insights into the impact of advanced techniques on KGR.

Conclusion: The paper outlines key research trends and promising future directions in KGR, emphasizing the need for comprehensive and systematic reviews.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

*Tomas Bueno Momcilovic, Barbara Gallina, Ingmar Kessler, Dian Balta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoGSN is an ontology and middleware for managing Assurance Cases (ACs) in the GSN standard, addressing challenges in maintaining and updating ACs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing ACs is challenging due to the effort required to maintain embedded knowledge, leading to poorly managed cases or false confidence.

Method: OntoGSN provides a knowledge representation and queryable graph, formalizing the GSN standard in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules, and includes tools for integration, automation, and community feedback.

Result: OntoGSN adheres to the GSN standard, evaluated via FAIR principles, OOPS framework, and community feedback, with demonstrated utility in dynamic AC management.

Conclusion: OntoGSN offers a robust solution for dynamic AC management, with ongoing development guided by community needs.

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example

*Weibing Zheng, Laurah Turner, Jess Kropczynski, Murat Ozer, Tri Nguyen, Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge, combining fuzzy logic and LLMs to automate and align clinical communication skills evaluation with physician preferences, achieving over 80% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical communication skills are vital but hard to assess at scale. Existing LLM-powered simulations lack nuanced physician-aligned evaluation.

Method: Data collection from an LLM-powered system, annotation using fuzzy sets (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, Contextual Distraction), prompt engineering, and supervised fine-tuning of LLMs.

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves >80% accuracy, with major criteria >90%, providing interpretable, human-aligned assessments.

Conclusion: Fuzzy logic and LLMs can align with human preferences, advancing scalable, robust automated evaluation in medical education.

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

### [263] [MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11331)
*Jihoon Yun, Chengzhang Li, Dhrubojyoti Roy, Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUDAS is a UDA framework for multi-label sound classification in IoT, improving accuracy with low resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods are unsuitable for multi-label tasks and resource-constrained IoT devices, especially in urban sound classification.

Method: MUDAS selectively retrains classifiers using high-confidence data, employs adaptive thresholds for pseudo-labels, and uses diversity regularization.

Result: MUDAS outperforms existing UDA methods on the SONYC-UST dataset in accuracy and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: MUDAS effectively addresses multi-label UDA challenges in IoT settings, offering a practical solution for urban sound classification.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

*Yitong Zhou, Mingyue Cheng, Qingyang Mao, Yucong Luo, Qi Liu, Yupeng Li, Xiaohan Zhang, Deguang Liu, Xin Li, Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemTable is a benchmark for chemical tables, addressing multimodal and domain-specific challenges in chemistry. It evaluates table recognition and understanding, revealing gaps in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the complexity of chemical tables, hindering multimodal models' ability to support scientific understanding in chemistry.

Method: ChemTable is introduced, featuring expert-annotated chemical tables from literature, supporting table recognition and understanding tasks.

Result: Models perform reasonably on layout parsing but lag in QA tasks compared to humans, with notable gaps between open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: ChemTable highlights challenges in chemistry-aware table understanding and serves as a rigorous benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study tested LLM-powered conversational agents to provide mental health support for caregivers, combining PST, MI, and BCA. The best models used Few-Shot and RAG techniques, showing improved empathy and therapeutic alliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mental health challenges faced by caregivers by leveraging LLMs for evidence-based support.

Method: Conducted a within-subject experiment with 28 caregivers evaluating four LLM configurations for empathy and therapeutic alliance.

Result: Models with Few-Shot and RAG techniques performed best, offering personalized support and validating emotions.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in delivering empathetic, tailored support for caregivers, though balancing assessment and advice remains a challenge.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

### [266] [FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11419)
*Bin Sun, Boao Zhang, Jiayi Lu, Xinjie Feng, Jiachen Shang, Rui Cao, Mengchao Zheng, Chuanye Wang, Shichun Yang, Yaoguang Cao, Ziying Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FocalAD is a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework focusing on critical local interactions to improve planning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore local agent interactions, which are crucial for planning, leading to obscured risks and unreliable decisions.

Method: FocalAD uses the Ego-Local-Agents Interactor (ELAI) for graph-based interaction representation and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss) to prioritize critical neighbors.

Result: FocalAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing collision rates by 41.9% and 15.6% on robustness-focused datasets.

Conclusion: Focusing on local interactions enhances planning reliability and safety in autonomous driving.

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

*Xuan Duy Ta, Bang Giang Le, Thanh Ha Le, Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Local State Attention module is proposed to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in mixed-traffic environments, enhancing conflict resolution and generalization to stochastic events like unexpected vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic environments struggle with local conflicts and stochastic events, requiring better state representation for MARL.

Method: Introduces a Local State Attention module using self-attention to compress nearby agents' information, tested in a simulated highway merging scenario with priority vehicles.

Result: Significant improvements in merging efficiency, especially in high-density traffic, compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The Local State Attention module effectively resolves conflicts and improves MARL performance in dynamic traffic scenarios.

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

*Zun Li, Marc Lanctot, Kevin R. McKee, Luke Marris, Ian Gemp, Daniel Hennes, Paul Muller, Kate Larson, Yoram Bachrach, Michael P. Wellman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable, generic opponent modeling method using deep game-theoretic RL, featuring a Generative Best Response (GenBR) algorithm and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing opponent modeling methods rely on domain-specific heuristics and struggle to scale in large, imperfect information domains.

Method: Proposes GenBR, a best response algorithm using MCTS and a deep generative model, integrated with PSRO for offline opponent modeling and bargaining theory for opponent mixtures.

Result: GenBR scales well, finds stronger policies, enables online co-player prediction, and achieves human-comparable negotiation outcomes.

Conclusion: The method is effective for scalable, generic opponent modeling and performs well in human-agent negotiations.

Abstract: Opponent modeling methods typically involve two crucial steps: building a
belief distribution over opponents' strategies, and exploiting this opponent
model by playing a best response. However, existing approaches typically
require domain-specific heurstics to come up with such a model, and algorithms
for approximating best responses are hard to scale in large, imperfect
information domains.
  In this work, we introduce a scalable and generic multiagent training regime
for opponent modeling using deep game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We
first propose Generative Best Respoonse (GenBR), a best response algorithm
based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a learned deep generative model
that samples world states during planning. This new method scales to large
imperfect information domains and can be plug and play in a variety of
multiagent algorithms. We use this new method under the framework of Policy
Space Response Oracles (PSRO), to automate the generation of an \emph{offline
opponent model} via iterative game-theoretic reasoning and population-based
training. We propose using solution concepts based on bargaining theory to
build up an opponent mixture, which we find identifying profiles that are near
the Pareto frontier. Then GenBR keeps updating an \emph{online opponent model}
and reacts against it during gameplay. We conduct behavioral studies where
human participants negotiate with our agents in Deal-or-No-Deal, a class of
bilateral bargaining games. Search with generative modeling finds stronger
policies during both training time and test time, enables online Bayesian
co-player prediction, and can produce agents that achieve comparable social
welfare and Nash bargaining score negotiating with humans as humans trading
among themselves.

*Zifan Liu, Yuan Cao, Yanwei Yu, Heng Qi, Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a structure-aware automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework using GCNs to improve pruning decisions by capturing global network dependencies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods rely on local heuristics or weight-based criteria, missing global structural dependencies, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Uses GCNs to model network topology and learn channel importance, enabling topology-aware pruning. Employs a search-based approach for optimal pruning rates.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and maintains competitive accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with models like ResNet and VGG16.

Conclusion: SACP offers a fully automated, structure-aware pruning solution that improves efficiency and accuracy retention.

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

*Chenrui Cao, Liangcheng Song, Zenan Li, Xinyi Le, Xian Zhang, Hui Xue, Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSP+ improves automated theorem proving by integrating neuro-symbolic methods without additional training, achieving competitive results and uncovering formalization errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of neuro-symbolic coordination in automated theorem proving without relying on large-scale RL training.

Method: Enhances the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework with fine-grained neuro-symbolic improvements for each phase: draft (subgoal generation), sketch (autoformalization), and prove (symbolic search integration).

Result: Solves 80.7%, 32.8%, and 24 problems from miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, and identifies formalization errors.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of classical reasoning patterns alongside RL-based methods, with open-sourced components.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+ extends RAG by adding application-aware reasoning, improving performance by 3-5% on average and up to 7.5% in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG paradigms lack explicit application of retrieved knowledge, creating a gap in task-specific reasoning.

Method: RAG+ introduces a dual corpus (knowledge and application examples) and retrieves both for structured reasoning.

Result: Experiments show RAG+ outperforms standard RAG, with average gains of 3-5% and peak gains of 7.5%.

Conclusion: RAG+ bridges retrieval and application, advancing a more interpretable and capable framework for LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

*Byeongchan Lee, Jonghoon Lee, Dongyoung Kim, Jaehyung Kim, Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for small and large LLMs to collaborate at test time, combining strengths of free small models and costly large models for efficient reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between costly large LLMs (strong reasoning) and free small LLMs (easy deployment) by enabling collaboration.

Method: A planner model generates a high-level plan, guiding a reasoner model to solve tasks collaboratively in multi-round cascades.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to proprietary models while reducing reliance on paid inference.

Conclusion: Planning is an effective prior for cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

TL;DR: A new German-language benchmark dataset evaluates VLMs on visual reasoning tasks with subject-specific knowledge, revealing significant gaps in performance, especially in non-English contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of real-world, contextualized benchmarks for VLMs in non-English languages, particularly German, and to assess their integration of visual and factual reasoning.

Method: The dataset includes 2,000+ open-ended questions based on 486 images from middle school curricula across nine domains. Thirteen VLMs were evaluated for domain-specific accuracy and adversarial robustness.

Result: Top models achieved <45% accuracy, with poor performance in music, math, and adversarial questions, highlighting discrepancies between benchmark and real-world performance.

Conclusion: Middle school tasks are a valuable, underused test for VLMs, especially in non-English settings, and the dataset provides a rigorous evaluation tool for future AI improvements.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SymMPO improves MLLMs by introducing symmetric preference learning and direct supervision, outperforming existing methods in hallucination reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reducing hallucination in MLLMs lack rigorous optimization and indirect supervision, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: SymMPO uses symmetric preference learning with direct supervision and a preference margin consistency loss to regulate preference gaps.

Result: SymMPO achieves superior performance across five benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucination in MLLMs.

Conclusion: SymMPO provides a rigorous and effective solution for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

TL;DR: AI agents automate negotiations and transactions, but performance varies, and risks like financial losses exist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore AI agents' role in automating consumer-market negotiations and transactions, assessing performance and risks.

Method: Develop an experimental framework to evaluate LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction scenarios.

Result: AI agents vary in securing favorable deals; behavioral anomalies can cause financial losses (e.g., overspending).

Conclusion: Automation improves efficiency but introduces risks; users should be cautious delegating decisions to AI agents.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist
with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In
this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants
authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to
answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to
secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating
deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we
develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM
agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal
that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different
agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover,
behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers
and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These
results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also
introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating
business decisions to AI agents.

TL;DR: R-GNNs, a GNN-based approach for learning value functions in planning domains, cannot learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features despite theoretical motivation. Alternative GNN architectures may perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of R-GNNs in learning value functions for planning domains, particularly those defined by $C_2$ features, and to identify limitations and potential improvements.

Method: Theoretical analysis of R-GNNs' expressive power in relation to $C_2$ features, supported by empirical evidence.

Result: R-GNNs fail to learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features, contrary to initial expectations. Alternative GNN architectures are suggested for better performance.

Conclusion: R-GNNs have limitations in learning $C_2$-defined value functions, highlighting the need for alternative GNN approaches in planning domains.

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect estimation with latent confounders, showing identifiability under specific conditions using multi-environment data. It proposes a moment-based algorithm and evaluates performance on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating causal effects when latent confounders are present, leveraging data from multiple environments where certain parameters remain invariant.

Method: Proposes a moment-based algorithm for causal effect estimation, assuming only one parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments. Also includes a procedure to identify the varying parameter.

Result: Demonstrates identifiability under specific conditions and evaluates the method's performance on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions, and the proposed method is effective, though identifiability is lost if multiple parameters vary.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Semantic Spacetime graph model, focusing on its formal aspects, scalability, and predictability in knowledge representation and process modeling. It addresses issues like absorbing states and division by zero, linking them to boundary information and intentionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the Semantic Spacetime graph model for scalable and predictable knowledge representation and process modeling, while addressing challenges like absorbing states and information leakage.

Method: Defines a finite γ(3,4) representation for closed operations and uses Semantic Spacetime postulates to ensure predictability in graph pathways.

Result: Identifies absorbing states as a source of information leakage, linking them to boundary conditions and intentionality.

Conclusion: The Semantic Spacetime model, rooted in Promise Theory, clarifies how boundary information and intentionality address absorbing states and closure issues.

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

*Margot Geerts, Manon Reusens, Bart Baesens, Seppe vanden Broucke, Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can democratize real estate insights by generating interpretable house price estimates using optimized In-Context Learning, though traditional models still outperform in pure accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing information asymmetry in the real estate market by leveraging LLMs for accessible and interpretable price estimates.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs on international housing datasets using zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques.

Result: LLMs effectively use hedonic variables for estimates, offering interactivity and interpretability, but struggle with overconfidence and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs improve transparency in real estate appraisal, with practical guidance for prompt optimization, though traditional models remain superior for accuracy.

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

TL;DR: LLMs' political biases and gender attributes in debates show Neutral agents align with Democrats, Republicans shift toward Neutral, and gender influences attitudes. Shared affiliations can create echo chambers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLM type and agent gender influence political bias in debates, given the underexplored dynamics of LLMs in simulating social behavior.

Method: A structured multi-agent debate framework with Neutral, Republican, and Democrat LLM agents, varying LLMs, genders, and debate formats to analyze bias and attitude shifts.

Result: Neutral agents align with Democrats; Republicans shift toward Neutral. Gender affects attitudes, and shared affiliations can form echo chambers, intensifying biases.

Conclusion: LLM type and gender significantly influence political bias in debates, with potential for echo chambers among like-minded agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in high-stake settings raises ethical concerns like biases, accountability, and privacy.

Method: A privacy-enhancing framework is proposed to reduce gender information in the learning pipeline, tested on two LLMs.

Result: The framework effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing data biases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for bias mitigation in LLMs, especially in sensitive applications like recruitment.

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

*Claudio Fanconi, Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cascaded LLM decision framework balances correctness, cost, and confidence by delegating tasks to base models, larger models, or humans, improving accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize human-AI decision-making by balancing prediction correctness, reasoning cost, and confidence in abstaining or involving humans.

Method: A two-stage cascaded framework: a deferral policy for model selection and an abstention policy for human intervention, with online learning from feedback.

Result: Outperforms single-model baselines in accuracy, reduces costs, and handles abstentions effectively in QA tasks.

Conclusion: The cascaded framework enhances decision-making efficiency and quality by dynamically leveraging models and human expertise.

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

*Wuzhenghong Wen, Su Pan, yuwei Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Schema-R1 improves schema linking in Text-to-SQL tasks using reinforcement learning, enhancing reasoning ability and achieving a 10% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for schema linking models focus too much on rote-learning, sacrificing reasoning ability due to lack of high-quality reasoning samples.

Method: Schema-R1 involves constructing high-quality reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for initialization, and rule-based reinforcement learning training.

Result: The method improves reasoning ability and achieves a 10% increase in filter accuracy over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Schema-R1 effectively addresses the limitations of current schema linking models by leveraging reinforcement learning for better reasoning performance.

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluating LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps (planning, revision, resource-constrained decisions) using strategic games, introducing new metrics beyond win rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks overlook intermediate reasoning steps, which are crucial for understanding and improving LLM reliability.

Method: A framework evaluates LLMs in strategic games, measuring planning, revision, and resource-constrained decisions with metrics like overcorrection risk rate and improvement slope.

Result: ChatGPT-o3-mini performed best, while Qwen-Plus struggled due to excessive resource use. A negative correlation was found between overcorrection risk and correction success.

Conclusion: Assessing how LLMs arrive at decisions, not just outcomes, is valuable for understanding and improving their behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI/NLP methods for eDiscovery struggle with legal entities, citations, and complex artifacts, necessitating a more effective solution.

Method: DISCOG integrates knowledge graphs and LLM-driven reasoning to enhance document ranking and classification.

Result: DISCOG achieves higher F1-score, precision, and recall than baselines and reduces document review costs by ~98%.

Conclusion: DISCOG is a highly effective solution for eDiscovery, significantly improving efficiency and cost savings.

Abstract: Electronic Discovery (eDiscovery) requires identifying relevant documents
from vast collections for legal production requests. While artificial
intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have improved document
review efficiency, current methods still struggle with legal entities,
citations, and complex legal artifacts. To address these challenges, we
introduce DISCOvery Graph (DISCOG), an emerging system that integrates
knowledge graphs for enhanced document ranking and classification, augmented by
LLM-driven reasoning. DISCOG outperforms strong baselines in F1-score,
precision, and recall across both balanced and imbalanced datasets. In
real-world deployments, it has reduced litigation-related document review costs
by approximately 98\%, demonstrating significant business impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in benchmark results of widely used models like Deepseek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B, which undermines their reliability and reproducibility.

Method: The study empirically assesses the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models, identifying factors causing evaluation fluctuations.

Result: Benchmark results for these models vary significantly with minor evaluation condition changes, making performance improvements hard to reproduce.

Conclusion: A more rigorous evaluation paradigm is needed to ensure reliable and consistent model performance assessments.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Conclusion: The overview serves as a valuable reference for developing customized FMs, bridging the gap in existing literature.

Abstract: The impressive performance of ChatGPT and other foundation-model-based
products in human language understanding has prompted both academia and
industry to explore how these models can be tailored for specific industries
and application scenarios. This process, known as the customization of
domain-specific foundation models (FMs), addresses the limitations of

this article provides a timely and thorough overview of the methodology for
customizing domain-specific FMs. It introduces basic concepts, outlines the
general architecture, and surveys key methods for constructing domain-specific

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RPAs struggle with hard queries conflicting with their role-play knowledge, prompting the need to assess and improve their conflict-handling performance.

Method: Developed an evaluation benchmark with different conflict types, conducted representation-level analysis, and introduced a lightweight representation editing approach.

Result: Most RPAs show performance gaps in handling conflicts; the editing method effectively shifts requests to rejection regions, improving refusal accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances RPAs' ability to refuse conflicting requests while preserving their general role-playing performance.

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) have shown remarkable performance in various
applications, yet they often struggle to recognize and appropriately respond to
hard queries that conflict with their role-play knowledge. To investigate RPAs'
performance when faced with different types of conflicting requests, we develop
an evaluation benchmark that includes contextual knowledge conflicting
requests, parametric knowledge conflicting requests, and non-conflicting
requests to assess RPAs' ability to identify conflicts and refuse to answer
appropriately without over-refusing. Through extensive evaluation, we find that
most RPAs behave significant performance gaps toward different conflict
requests. To elucidate the reasons, we conduct an in-depth representation-level
analysis of RPAs under various conflict scenarios. Our findings reveal the
existence of rejection regions and direct response regions within the model's
forwarding representation, and thus influence the RPA's final response
behavior. Therefore, we introduce a lightweight representation editing approach
that conveniently shifts conflicting requests to the rejection region, thereby
enhancing the model's refusal accuracy. The experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our editing method, improving RPAs' refusal ability of
conflicting requests while maintaining their general role-playing capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A zero-shot method adapts pre-trained RL policies to user preferences via human feedback without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning RL policies with human preferences without costly retraining.

Method: Infer user intent from trajectory-level feedback and fuse it with the trained policy dynamically.

Result: Empirically achieves task goals while meeting user-specific needs.

Conclusion: Dynamic policy fusion effectively aligns RL policies with human preferences without additional environment interactions.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies, although optimal in terms of task
rewards, may not align with the personal preferences of human users. To ensure
this alignment, a naive solution would be to retrain the agent using a reward
function that encodes the user's specific preferences. However, such a reward
function is typically not readily available, and as such, retraining the agent
from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a more practical
approach - to adapt the already trained policy to user-specific needs with the
help of human feedback. To this end, we infer the user's intent through
trajectory-level feedback and combine it with the trained task policy via a
theoretically grounded dynamic policy fusion approach. As our approach collects
human feedback on the very same trajectories used to learn the task policy, it
does not require any additional interactions with the environment, making it a
zero-shot approach. We empirically demonstrate in a number of environments that
our proposed dynamic policy fusion approach consistently achieves the intended
task while simultaneously adhering to user-specific needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL approaches struggle with complex tasks and optimal solutions, necessitating a new framework.

Method: HYPRL uses HyperLTL for specification, Skolemization for quantifier alternations, and robustness functions for reward shaping in MDPs.

Result: HYPRL effectively learns policies maximizing HyperLTL satisfaction, outperforming baselines in diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: HYPRL offers a robust and efficient solution for MARL tasks with complex specifications.

Abstract: Reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks
remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal
solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a
specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control
policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties
constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over
sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the
satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage
quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape
rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown
transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that
collectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the
probability of satisfying $\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post
Correspondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Artificial General Intelligence by improving context-aware reactive behaviors, addressing the limitations of Transformers in reasoning.

Method: Proposes a mechanism for Synthetic Cognition to handle sequences and tests it against DNA foundation models in classification tasks.

Result: The proposed method outperforms DNA foundation models, achieving better scores in benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: Successfully expands Synthetic Cognition to sequences and surpasses Transformer architecture in sequence classification.

Abstract: The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of
context-aware reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been
proven to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop
reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures,
called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop
instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of
Synthetic Cognition to develop context-aware reactive behaviors. We propose a
mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic
Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence
classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the
DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than
the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to
deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence
classification.

Method: Uses a LAG framework combining semantic knowledge graphs and prompt heuristics to generate extended knowledge graph triples for implicit reasoning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in metaphor detection tasks, excels in visual metaphor understanding, and provides explainable reasoning, though struggles with domain-specific metaphors.

Conclusion: The LAG framework enhances reasoning and explainability but has limitations in domain-specific metaphor understanding; error analysis highlights issues with annotations and evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated their capabilities
across a variety of tasks. However, automatically extracting implicit knowledge
from natural language remains a significant challenge, as machines lack active
experience with the physical world. Given this scenario, semantic knowledge
graphs can serve as conceptual spaces that guide the automated text generation
reasoning process to achieve more efficient and explainable results. In this
paper, we apply a logic-augmented generation (LAG) framework that leverages the
explicit representation of a text through a semantic knowledge graph and
applies it in combination with prompt heuristics to elicit implicit analogical
connections. This method generates extended knowledge graph triples
representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled
multimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three
metaphor detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they
require deep analogical reasoning capabilities. The results show that this
integrated approach surpasses current baselines, performs better than humans in
understanding visual metaphors, and enables more explainable reasoning
processes, though still has inherent limitations in metaphor understanding,
especially for domain-specific metaphors. Furthermore, we propose a thorough
error analysis, discussing issues with metaphorical annotations and current
evaluation methods.

### [295] [Epistemic Artificial Intelligence is Essential for Machine Learning Models to Truly `Know When They Do Not Know'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04950)
*Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Andrew Bradley, Julian F. P. Kooij, Keivan Shariatmadar, Neil Yorke-Smith, Fabio Cuzzolin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for epistemic AI, using second-order uncertainty measures to improve AI's robustness and generalization beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle with uncertainty and generalization, failing in unfamiliar or adversarial scenarios. Current methods are limited.

Method: Proposes epistemic AI, leveraging second-order uncertainty measures to manage uncertainty and acknowledge ignorance.

Result: This approach enhances AI resilience and robustness in unpredictable environments.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift to epistemic AI is needed for better handling of real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: Despite AI's impressive achievements, including recent advances in generative
and large language models, there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI
systems to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond their training data. AI
models consistently fail to make robust enough predictions when facing
unfamiliar or adversarial data. Traditional machine learning approaches
struggle to address this issue, due to an overemphasis on data fitting, while
current uncertainty quantification approaches suffer from serious limitations.
This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic artificial
intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn from what they know
while at the same time acknowledging their ignorance, using the mathematics of
second-order uncertainty measures. This approach, which leverages the
expressive power of such measures to efficiently manage uncertainty, offers an
effective way to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, allowing
them to better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

### [297] [Does Thinking More always Help? Understanding Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04210)
*Soumya Suvra Ghosal, Souradip Chakraborty, Avinash Reddy, Yifu Lu, Mengdi Wang, Dinesh Manocha, Furong Huang, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Amrit Singh Bedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extended thinking in reasoning models initially improves performance but leads to 'overthinking' and decline. A probabilistic model explains this as increased output variance. Parallel thinking, an alternative, outperforms extended thinking by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if extended thinking at test-time truly enhances reasoning performance and to understand the observed non-monotonic trend.

Method: Empirical study across models and benchmarks, analysis using a probabilistic model, and introduction of parallel thinking (inspired by Best-of-N sampling).

Result: Extended thinking initially improves but then harms performance due to overthinking. Parallel thinking achieves up to 20% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Extended thinking is ineffective; parallel thinking is a better test-time scaling approach for reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using
prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a
natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better
reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study
across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial
performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to
"overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple
probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output
variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately
undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true
indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection
between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time
scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the
inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an
alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by
Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths
within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via
majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended
thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling
of reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeePoly combines DNNs and polynomial basis functions for solving PDEs, improving accuracy and efficiency while maintaining theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNN-based methods for PDEs lack convergence guarantees and efficiency compared to numerical schemes.

Method: A two-stage approach: DNNs capture global features, followed by linear optimization with DNN-extracted features and polynomial bases.

Result: Enhanced high-order accuracy and efficiency across problem types, with mesh-free and scheme-free properties.

Conclusion: DeePoly offers a robust, theoretically grounded framework for PDE solutions, also supporting an open-source project.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Spotter) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses large-scale itinerary planning by introducing weak decomposability and a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm to optimize POI scores, travel time, and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of large-scale itinerary planning, which involves balancing multiple objectives (POI scores, travel time, cost) under constraints, and overcoming issues like component imbalance and interactions.

Method: Proposes a multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm with dynamic decomposition, optimization potential definition, and computational resource allocation.

Result: The algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially as problem scale increases, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Weak decomposability and the proposed algorithm effectively address large-scale itinerary planning, offering scalable and superior performance.

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale
grows.

Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately assess MLLMs' perception and reasoning in scientific contexts, necessitating a more comprehensive evaluation.

Method: SFE evaluates MLLMs through three levels: scientific signal perception, attribute understanding, and comparative reasoning, using 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across 66 tasks in five disciplines.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-o3 and InternVL-3) scored only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: SFE provides insights to advance AI's role in scientific discovery by addressing gaps in MLLMs' scientific cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in speaker diarization like structured representations, efficient modeling, and robustness.

Method: Integrates conformer decoders, transformer-updated attractors, deep clustering loss, cross-attention, and orthogonality constraints.

Result: Achieves low diarization error while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is performant and compact, addressing key diarization challenges.

Abstract: Speaker diarization remains challenging due to the need for structured
speaker representations, efficient modeling, and robustness to varying
conditions. We propose a performant, compact diarization framework that
integrates conformer decoders, transformer-updated attractors, and a deep
clustering style angle loss. Our approach refines speaker representations with
an enhanced conformer structure, incorporating cross-attention to attractors
and an additional convolution module. To enforce structured embeddings, we
extend deep clustering by constructing label-attractor vectors, aligning their
directional structure with audio embeddings. We also impose orthogonality
constraints on active attractors for better speaker separation while
suppressing non-active attractors to prevent false activations. Finally, a
permutation invariant training binary cross-entropy loss refines speaker
detection. Experiments show that our method achieves low diarization error
while maintaining parameter count.

Motivation: To understand the unclear impact of anisotropy in pretrained speech representations on downstream tasks, specifically keyword spotting in computational documentary linguistics.

Method: Uses Dynamic Time Warping to assess wav2vec2 similarity measures for identifying words without transcription.

Result: Despite anisotropy, wav2vec2 effectively identifies words, capturing phonetic structures and generalizing across speakers.

Conclusion: Pretraining is crucial for learning rich and invariant speech representations, as demonstrated by the robustness of wav2vec2 in keyword spotting.

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.

TL;DR: GLAP extends CLAP to support multilingual and multi-domain audio-text tasks, outperforming existing methods in speech retrieval, classification, and multilingual evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLAP methods focus only on English, ignoring multilingual spoken content, limiting their applicability.

Method: GLAP expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain capabilities, evaluated on benchmarks like Clotho, AudioCaps, and speech tasks.

Result: GLAP achieves competitive performance on audio-text retrieval, surpasses existing methods in speech tasks, and excels in multilingual evaluations.

Conclusion: GLAP demonstrates superior versatility and multilingual performance, making it a robust alternative to CLAP for broader applications.

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

TL;DR: A correlation-permutation method merges speech and music encoders, improving music performance by 14.83 points over linear interpolation, while retaining speech capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified audio model from independently trained encoders without expensive pre-training.

Method: A correlation-permutation approach aligns layers of a music encoder with a speech encoder, computing permutation matrices to maximize cross-correlations.

Result: The merged model enhances music performance by 14.83 points while maintaining speech capabilities.

Conclusion: This method enables effective fusion of disjoint models, creating unified audio models efficiently.

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA text-to-audio models lack fine-grained, time-varying controls needed for music production, and ControlNet's approach is memory-intensive and inflexible.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, modular architecture to reduce parameters, enabling efficient training and deployment of independent controls.

Result: Matches ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence while offering greater flexibility and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient, flexible solution for fine-grained control in audio generation, with extensive evaluations and examples available.

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the detection of spoofed utterances by uncovering and amplifying hidden artifacts introduced by generative models.

Method: Proposes a three-step pipeline: noise addition, noise extraction (via speech enhancement), and noise amplification. Compatible with various models.

Result: Improves spoof detection by up to 44.44% on ASVspoof2019 and 26.34% on ASVspoof2021.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively enhances artifact visibility, boosting detection performance across datasets.

Abstract: Spoofed utterances always contain artifacts introduced by generative models.
While several countermeasures have been proposed to detect spoofed utterances,
most primarily focus on architectural improvements. In this work, we
investigate how artifacts remain hidden in spoofed speech and how to enhance
their presence. We propose a model-agnostic pipeline that amplifies artifacts
using speech enhancement and various types of noise. Our approach consists of
three key steps: noise addition, noise extraction, and noise amplification.
First, we introduce noise into the raw speech. Then, we apply speech
enhancement to extract the entangled noise and artifacts. Finally, we amplify
these extracted features. Moreover, our pipeline is compatible with different
speech enhancement models and countermeasure architectures. Our method improves
spoof detection performance by up to 44.44\% on ASVspoof2019 and 26.34\% on
ASVspoof2021.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To thoroughly analyze the synergy of enhancements in speaker diarization pipelines and identify optimal architecture choices.

Method: In-depth experiments with different encoders (SincNet, WavLM), decoders (LSTM, Mamba, Conformer), losses (multilabel, multiclass powerset), and chunk sizes across nine datasets.

Result: Finetuned WavLM encoder and Conformer decoder performed best. Mamba was robust but slightly inferior. Multiclass loss generally outperformed multilabel, except with finetuned WavLM. Larger chunk sizes improved newer architectures.

Conclusion: The best system achieved state-of-the-art results on five datasets, highlighting the superiority of finetuned WavLM and Conformer, with multiclass loss being generally better.

Abstract: End-to-End Neural Diarization with Vector Clustering is a powerful and
practical approach to perform Speaker Diarization. Multiple enhancements have
been proposed for the segmentation model of these pipelines, but their synergy
had not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we provide an in-depth
analysis on the impact of major architecture choices on the performance of the
pipeline. We investigate different encoders (SincNet, pretrained and finetuned
WavLM), different decoders (LSTM, Mamba, and Conformer), different losses
(multilabel and multiclass powerset), and different chunk sizes. Through
in-depth experiments covering nine datasets, we found that the finetuned
WavLM-based encoder always results in the best systems by a wide margin. The
LSTM decoder is outclassed by Mamba- and Conformer-based decoders, and while we
found Mamba more robust to other architecture choices, it is slightly inferior
to our best architecture, which uses a Conformer encoder. We found that
multilabel and multiclass powerset losses do not have the same distribution of
errors. We confirmed that the multiclass loss helps almost all models attain
superior performance, except when finetuning WavLM, in which case, multilabel
is the superior choice. We also evaluated the impact of the chunk size on all
aforementioned architecture choices and found that newer architectures tend to
better handle long chunk sizes, which can greatly improve pipeline performance.
Our best system achieved state-of-the-art results on five widely used speaker
diarization datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SimPhon Speech Test-25, a novel speech perception test designed to address supra-threshold deficits in hearing loss, using computational methods and ASR systems for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audiometry inadequately captures the functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, especially for supra-threshold deficits like those in presbycusis.

Method: A multi-stage computational pipeline uses ASR to simulate hearing loss effects, identifies phoneme confusion patterns, curates word pairs, and refines them through simulated testing and expert curation.

Result: The optimized SimPhon Speech Test-25 shows no significant correlation with the Speech Intelligibility Index, indicating it captures deficits beyond audibility.

Conclusion: The SimPhon Speech Test-25 offers a more efficient and diagnostically specific tool for audiological testing, ready for human trials.

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

*Daniil Kocharov, Okko Räsänen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to automatically detect and transcribe reliable utterances in longform child-centered audio recordings, improving accuracy over full-transcription approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longform child-centered audio recordings are valuable for studying language development, but manual transcription is impractical, and traditional ASR struggles with noise and scale.

Method: The approach identifies utterances in longform audio that can be accurately transcribed by modern ASR systems, filtering out unreliable segments.

Result: The method achieves a median WER of 0% and mean WER of 18% for 13% of speech, outperforming unfiltered ASR (median WER 52%, mean WER 51%). Word frequency correlations with manual transcripts are high (r=0.92-0.98).

Conclusion: This work advances automated linguistic analysis of child-centered longform audio by enabling reliable partial transcription.

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

Method: Employing inversion techniques with novel SDE and ODE models based on DPMSolver++ samplers, eliminating circular dependencies and avoiding prompt conditioning.

Result: The proposed inversion approach achieves flexible guidance during sampling without requiring prompt conditioning.

Conclusion: The method successfully synthesizes novel sounds with auditory features beyond additive superposition, using advanced inversion models.

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach and Libri-EMG dataset to improve Voiced EMG-to-Speech (V-ETS) models by addressing data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of V-ETS models is limited by the lack of paired EMG-speech data.

Method: Proposes CoM2S, leveraging synthetic EMG data and phoneme-level confidence filtering for self-training.

Result: Improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word error rate.

Conclusion: CoM2S is effective for V-ETS; the Libri-EMG dataset and codes will be released for future research.

Abstract: Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech
from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as
neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS
is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we
propose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach,
along with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic
EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering
mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through
the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method
improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word
error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In
support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed
Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and

*Olga Vechtomova, Jeff Bos*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A bidirectional AI system allows dancers to shape music dynamically, creating a collaborative dance-music partnership.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond the unidirectional relationship of dance responding to music and explore AI as a responsive collaborator in performing arts.

Method: A multi-modal architecture combines pre-recorded musical clips intelligently in response to dance movements.

Result: Emergent communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features were demonstrated.

Conclusion: The system redefines AI's role in performing arts, enabling collaborative creativity for professional and improvisational dance.

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

### [313] [Improving Acoustic Scene Classification with City Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16862)
*Yiqiang Cai, Yizhou Tan, Shengchen Li, Xi Shao, Mark D. Plumbley*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes City2Scene, a framework that uses city-specific acoustic features to improve acoustic scene classification (ASC) by leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained city classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASC methods overlook city-specific acoustic differences caused by environmental and cultural factors. The paper hypothesizes that these features are beneficial for ASC.

Method: City2Scene transfers city-specific knowledge from pre-trained city classification models to ASC models using knowledge distillation.

Result: Experiments on DCASE Challenge datasets show city features enhance ASC accuracy, with City2Scene outperforming conventional methods and matching top DCASE solutions.

Conclusion: City-specific acoustic features are valuable for ASC, and City2Scene effectively leverages them to improve performance.

Abstract: Acoustic scene recordings are often collected from a diverse range of cities.
Most existing acoustic scene classification (ASC) approaches focus on
identifying common acoustic scene patterns across cities to enhance
generalization. However, the potential acoustic differences introduced by
city-specific environmental and cultural factors are overlooked. In this paper,
we hypothesize that the city-specific acoustic features are beneficial for the
ASC task rather than being treated as noise or bias. To this end, we propose
City2Scene, a novel framework that leverages city features to improve ASC.
Unlike conventional approaches that may discard or suppress city information,
City2Scene transfers the city-specific knowledge from pre-trained city
classification models to scene classification model using knowledge
distillation. We evaluate City2Scene on three datasets of DCASE Challenge Task
1, which include both scene and city labels. Experimental results demonstrate
that city features provide valuable information for classifying scenes. By
distilling city-specific knowledge, City2Scene effectively improves accuracy
across a variety of lightweight CNN backbones, achieving competitive
performance to the top-ranked solutions of DCASE Challenge in recent years.

Motivation: To enable precise voice conversion with independent control of speaker timbre and environmental acoustics, addressing interference between attributes.

Method: Uses latent diffusion modeling on synthetic data with decoupled features and a Retrieval-Based Timbre Control (RBTC) module for abstract descriptions.

Result: Effectively generates contextually appropriate speech with high content retention and superior controllability.

Conclusion: TES-VC demonstrates potential for widespread applications due to its accuracy and controllability.

Abstract: We propose TES-VC (Text-driven Environment and Speaker controllable Voice
Conversion), a text-driven voice conversion framework with independent control
of speaker timbre and environmental acoustics. TES-VC processes simultaneous
text inputs for target voice and environment, accurately generating speech
matching described timbre/environment while preserving source content. Trained
on synthetic data with decoupled vocal/environment features via latent
diffusion modeling, our method eliminates interference between attributes. The
Retrieval-Based Timbre Control (RBTC) module enables precise manipulation using
abstract descriptions without paired data. Experiments confirm TES-VC
effectively generates contextually appropriate speech in both timbre and
environment with high content retention and superior controllability which
demonstrates its potential for widespread applications.

Conclusion: Step-Audio-AQAA offers a promising solution for end-to-end LALMs, emphasizing the importance of token-based vocoders for AQAA tasks.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully
end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model
integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the
state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for
end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in
enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Interactive Cross-modal Learning (ICL) framework to improve text-to-image person re-identification by integrating human-centered interaction and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with challenging candidate images due to network architecture and data quality limitations.

Method: The framework includes a Test-time Human-centered Interaction (THI) module for refining queries via multimodal large language models and a Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy to enhance text quality.

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks on four datasets, showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: ICL effectively addresses limitations in TIReID by leveraging interaction and data augmentation, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dyslexia affects 10-20% of people globally, necessitating accessible diagnostic tools.

Method: Combined eye-tracking (analyzing fixation durations and saccades) with machine learning (Random Forest Classifier and hierarchical clustering).

Result: Achieved 88.58% accuracy in detecting dyslexia and identified severity levels.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking with machine learning offers a non-invasive, accurate, and accessible diagnostic method for dyslexia.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'essential data science' as an ecosystem addressing 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, ethics) across the data life cycle. It highlights the role of data agents and scientists, warns of divergence between computational and foundational data science, and suggests measuring usefulness to mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified view of data science as an ecosystem, addressing challenges from the data universe and its complexities, while emphasizing the need for integration and usefulness in discoveries.

Method: The paper semantically splits essential data science into computational and foundational aspects, defines discipline-induced and pan-data science, and proposes measuring the usefulness of data discoveries.

Result: Identifies a potential divergence between computational and foundational data science and suggests rigorous usefulness metrics as a solution.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a holistic approach to data science, integrating disciplines and ensuring discoveries are useful to prevent divergence between computational and foundational aspects.

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

*Minhyuk Seo, Taeheon Kim, Hankook Lee, Jonghyun Choi, Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy and cost issues in centralized foundation models by proposing personalized federated learning (PFL) methods for multi-modal tasks, handling data and model heterogeneity with novel aggregation and knowledge-sharing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training of foundation models raises privacy concerns and high transmission costs, while existing PFL studies overlook real-world data and model heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes a task-similarity-aware model aggregation for data heterogeneity and a dimension-invariant module for model heterogeneity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in personalization and generalization on a benchmark of 40 multi-modal tasks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles real-world heterogeneity in PFL, enhancing both personalization and generalization.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings raise fairness concerns about biases in digital identity systems.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)

exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital

TL;DR: The paper compares four synthetic data generation methods for dToU electricity tariffs, finding diffusion models best for utility and CTGAN for privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with real consumption data drive the need for synthetic alternatives.

Method: Comparative evaluation of WGAN, CTGAN, Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation.

Result: Diffusion models achieve highest utility (88.2% macro-F1); CTGAN resists reconstruction attacks best.

Conclusion: Structured generative models like diffusion and CTGAN are promising for privacy-preserving energy systems.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating accurate code for languages with scarce public training data compared to popular ones like Python.

Method: Combines small-scale Qwen 2.5 with GRPO, integrating reasoning-driven feedback into reinforcement learning.

Result: Improved reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical correctness, especially for Prolog.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for languages lacking extensive training resources.

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

TL;DR: The study explores the role of mobility data and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in predicting disease outbreaks, finding that mortality and hospitalization data improve accuracy more than mobility data or GCNs. Spatial maps from GCNs correlate with lockdown orders, suggesting their utility as mobility indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine learning algorithms and their real-world epidemiological applications, particularly in incorporating mobility data for outbreak prediction.

Method: A two-phase approach: (1) pilot study assessing mobility data significance, (2) evaluating GCNs on a transformer backbone.

Result: Mobility data and GCNs do not significantly improve forecasting, but mortality and hospitalization data do. GCN-derived spatial maps correlate with lockdown orders.

Conclusion: Spatial maps offer a novel mobility representation for disease prediction, aiding decision-makers in outbreak preparedness.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Motivation: To improve time series prediction by introducing a joint forecasting framework that contrasts traditional methods and leverages delayed chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Uses a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer trained via masked token recovery, enhanced by a multi-input ensemble to reduce output variance.

Result: YingLong outperforms other models by 60% in zero-shot tasks and achieves 14-44% better rank in the GIFT-Eval benchmark.

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forward Target Propagation (FTP) is proposed as a biologically plausible and efficient alternative to backpropagation (BP), using feedforward computations to estimate targets, achieving competitive accuracy and hardware compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BP has limitations like non-local credit assignment and hardware inefficiency. FTP addresses these by eliminating backward passes and symmetric weights.

Method: FTP replaces BP's backward pass with a second forward pass, using feedforward computations for layerwise targets, enabling modular and local learning.

Result: FTP matches BP's accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, excels in sequential tasks, and outperforms BP in low-precision and hardware-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: FTP is a promising, efficient alternative to BP for energy-efficient on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces zero-shot-s², a task-aligned prompting method for detecting AI-generated images using pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), improving performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of supervised detection methods for AI-generated images, which struggle with generalization across diverse generators.

Method: Uses pre-trained VLMs with task-aligned prompting (zero-shot-s²) to enhance detection performance, focusing on style and synthesis artifacts.

Result: Zero-shot-s² boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29% across diverse datasets and models, showing strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: Task-aligned prompts enhance VLMs' latent capabilities for AI-generated image detection, offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our

*Minjae Kwon, Tyler Ingebrand, Ufuk Topcu, Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A runtime shielding mechanism for reinforcement learning is developed to ensure safety by adapting to hidden parameters like mass distribution or friction, using real-time inference and probabilistic safety guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden parameters in robotics (e.g., mass distribution, friction) introduce safety risks during execution, necessitating adaptive safety measures.

Method: The method employs constrained hidden-parameter Markov decision processes, function encoders for real-time inference, and conformal prediction to forecast safety risks and constrain actions.

Result: The mechanism reduces safety violations, achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, and incurs minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed shield ensures probabilistic safety guarantees and optimal policies among safety-compliant ones, validated across diverse environments.

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalVLBench, a benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) on visual causal reasoning tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of LVLMs in tasks like recognition and VQA, their performance in visual causal reasoning remains underexplored. The paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: The authors propose CausalVLBench, a benchmark with three tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction, evaluated on three datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art LVLMs are assessed, revealing their fundamental strengths and weaknesses in visual causal reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark aims to highlight limitations of current LVLMs and inspire improvements in their visual causal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

*Andreas Kontogiannis, Konstantinos Papathanasiou, Yi Shen, Giorgos Stamou, Michael M. Zavlanos, George Vouros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a state modeling framework and the MARL SMPE algorithm to improve cooperation in partially observable multi-agent environments without communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) where agents must cooperate without communication in partially observable settings.

Method: Introduces a state modeling framework for inferring belief representations and the SMPE algorithm, which enhances policy discriminative abilities through adversarial exploration.

Result: SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in cooperative tasks across MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and SMPE algorithm effectively improve agent cooperation and performance in distributed, partially observable environments.

Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with
no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this
domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent
observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents'
exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose
a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer
meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to
optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative
joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE
algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities
under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the
policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration
policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while
improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that
SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative
tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

### [331] [Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11035)
*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable version of Tversky's similarity model for deep learning, replacing geometric similarity with feature-based similarity, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometric similarity models in deep learning lack psychological plausibility, unlike Tversky's feature-based theory, which better aligns with human perception.

Method: Developed a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity, creating neural network components like the Tversky projection layer, and tested it in image and language tasks.

Result: The Tversky projection layer improved image classification accuracy by 24.7% and reduced GPT-2's perplexity by 7.5% while cutting parameters by 34.8%.

Conclusion: The work provides a psychologically plausible, interpretable alternative to geometric similarity in deep learning, enhancing performance and understanding.

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

*Aochuan Chen, Yifan Niu, Ziqi Gao, Yujie Sun, Shoujun Liu, Gong Chen, Yang Liu, Jia Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRePO-LTV, a framework combining graph representation learning and Pareto-optimization to improve LTV prediction in data-scarce, multi-task advertising scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LTV prediction is crucial for aligning user interests with ads, but data scarcity and task interdependencies complicate the problem.

Method: Graph representation learning addresses data scarcity, while Pareto-optimization handles task interdependencies.

Result: The proposed GRePO-LTV framework aims to enhance LTV prediction accuracy despite low purchase rates and correlated tasks.

Conclusion: GRePO-LTV offers a novel solution to the challenges of LTV prediction in advertising, leveraging graph learning and multi-task optimization.

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

*Linjie Li, Zhenyu Wu, Yang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MoTE framework for class-incremental learning (CIL) to address prompt overwriting and dimensional misalignment, outperforming existing methods without exemplars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL methods using pre-trained models face issues like prompt overwriting and dimensional misalignment, while MoE struggles with parameter overwriting in dynamic environments.

Method: Introduces MoTE, leveraging task-aware expert filtering and joint inference inspired by MoE, ensuring dimensional consistency and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Result: MoTE outperforms existing methods, scales linearly with adapters, and explores performance trade-offs with Adapter-Limited MoTE.

Conclusion: MoTE effectively addresses CIL challenges, offering a scalable and exemplar-free solution with promising performance.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

*Cheng Jin, Zhenyu Xiao, Chutao Liu, Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) improves text-to-image synthesis but causes color distortions at high guidance weights. The proposed Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) mitigates distortions while maintaining alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address color distortions in CFG while preserving text-image alignment.

Method: Analyze norm amplification in latent space, propose ADG to constrain magnitude and optimize angles.

Result: ADG outperforms existing methods, improving color fidelity and perceptual alignment.

Conclusion: ADG effectively balances text-image alignment and color fidelity in diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of

First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

TL;DR: ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network, outperforms traditional GNNs in modeling multi-reactant reactions by using hyperedges and innovative sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with multi-reactant interactions in chemistry, necessitating a more expressive framework.

Method: ChemHGNN uses hyperedges for multi-reactant modeling, RCNS for negative sampling, and hierarchical embeddings for molecule, reaction, and hypergraph features.

Result: ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines on the USPTO dataset, especially in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: HGNNs like ChemHGNN are superior to GNNs for reaction virtual screening, offering a chemically informed approach for accelerating discovery.

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFT is a novel PEFT method that leverages pretrained weights to guide task-specific updates, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid inefficient training of task-specific updates from scratch by utilizing pretrained weights for guidance.

Method: GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill structured information from pretrained weights and decomposes updates into shared and specific components.

Result: GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods on CV and NLP benchmarks like VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE.

Conclusion: GenFT offers a resource-efficient and high-performing approach for model adaptation, advancing PEFT techniques.

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces null space projection (Q2N) to reduce quantization error in LLMs by constraining weight perturbations within the null space of input activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for LLMs show diminishing returns, indicating a need for new strategies to achieve higher compression without performance loss.

Method: Proposes Q2N, a plug-and-play null space projection module for PTQ baselines, with an efficient approximation method and closed-form solution for practical inference.

Result: Experiments on LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) validate Q2N's effectiveness and the potential of null space optimization.

Conclusion: The paper pioneers null space insights for quantization error reduction, encouraging future research in advanced quantization methods.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Motivation: Addressing the lack of interactive and compositional tool-use training data for online RL, especially in LLM tool-use agents.

Method: Introduces RandomWorld, a procedural generation pipeline for interactive tools and compositional tool-use data.

Result: Models trained on RandomWorld data achieve SoTA on NESTFUL benchmarks and show performance scaling with data volume.

Conclusion: RandomWorld enables effective synthetic data generation, promising further improvements in tool-use tasks.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Motivation: To explore how different data augmentation methods impact confidence estimation in large language models (LLMs) and address limitations of current techniques.

Method: Study the effects of various data augmentation strategies on confidence estimation, analyzing performance and overconfidence mitigation.

Result: Greater data diversity improves augmentation effectiveness, and random combinations of augmentations perform well across applications.

Conclusion: Data augmentation enhances confidence estimation in LLMs, with diverse and random strategies being particularly effective.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large
language models (LLMs), particularly in the widely used closed-source models.
Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a
promising choice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A perception-driven framework for bias detection in machine learning, using crowdsourced human judgment to identify disparities without relying on sensitive labels or rigid fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional bias detection methods, which require sensitive labels or fixed fairness metrics, by leveraging human visual intuition for scalable and interpretable fairness auditing.

Method: Develop a lightweight web platform to display simplified visualizations of data (e.g., salary distributions) and collect binary judgments on group similarity from non-expert users. Aggregate feedback to flag biased segments, validated through statistical tests and ML cross-evaluations.

Result: Perceptual signals from users reliably correlate with known bias cases, demonstrating that visual intuition can effectively detect disparities.

Conclusion: The framework provides a label-efficient, interpretable alternative for fairness auditing, enabling scalable, human-aligned bias detection.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Motivation: Address limitations of real-valued neural networks in capturing wireless signal properties like phase and amplitude, especially in low-SNR conditions.

Method: Introduces CMuSeNet with complex-valued architecture, residual design, Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL), and complex plane IoU (CIoU) metric.

Result: Achieves 98.98%-99.90% accuracy, 9.2% improvement over real-valued networks, and 92.2% faster training.

Conclusion: Complex-valued architectures enhance weak signal detection and training efficiency for spectrum sensing.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSW-EPNews, a benchmark for evaluating time-series and LLMs in electricity price forecasting, revealing marginal benefits from news features for traditional models and modest gains with LLMs, alongside hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing electricity price forecasting methods rely on numerical data and ignore textual signals, creating a gap in multimodal evaluation.

Method: The study uses a dataset of 175,000 half-hourly spot prices, temperature readings, and market-news summaries, framing the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting with multimodal inputs.

Result: Traditional models show marginal gains from news features, while LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibit modest performance improvements but suffer from hallucinations.

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews highlights the gap between LLM capabilities and high-stakes forecasting needs, providing a testbed for grounded numerical reasoning.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

Motivation: To explore and enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities for NP-hard combinatorial optimization tasks.

Method: Introduces ACCORD with autoregressive constraint-satisfying generation, dynamic attention, and problem-specific LoRA modules. Uses the ACCORD-90k dataset.

Result: ACCORD consistently outperforms standard methods and larger LLMs, improving solution feasibility.

Conclusion: First large-scale, end-to-end framework for LLMs in combinatorial optimization, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

*Weichang Wu, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Zhou, Yuchen Li, Wenwen Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bootstrapping Your Behavior (BYB), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that automates behavior vocabulary selection, improving model generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual behavior vocabulary selection in UBS pretraining is labor-intensive, biased, and limits model generalization.

Method: BYB predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing future behaviors, using a student-teacher encoder scheme.

Result: Experiments show 3.9% AUC improvement, 98.9% training throughput gain, and meaningful unsupervised patterns. Online deployment reduced bad debt risk significantly.

Conclusion: BYB outperforms manual methods, enhancing efficiency and generalization in UBS modeling.

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic and uncertain nature of IoT environments causes data distribution fluctuations and evolving system requirements, challenging the long-term effectiveness of MLaaS compositions.

Method: The framework includes a service assessment model to detect underperforming services, a candidate selection model for optimal replacements, and an adaptive composition mechanism using contextual multi-armed bandit optimization.

Result: The approach maintains QoS while reducing computational costs, as demonstrated by experiments on a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively adapts to IoT constraints, ensuring seamless and scalable MLaaS compositions.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

*Michael Buzzy, Andreas Robertson, Peng Chen, Surya Kalidindi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel ML approach for hyper-sparse data in materials science, using physics-driven augmentation and local generative models, achieves breakthroughs in polycrystalline materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large datasets for structural and functional materials by enabling learning from very few examples.

Method: Physics-driven data augmentation with local generative models and diversity curation to create large datasets from minimal observations.

Result: Developed PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials, solving 3D microscopy challenges zero-shot.

Conclusion: The approach advances materials science by enabling scalable learning from sparse data, with open models and datasets for community use.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

*Sean Memery, Kevin Denamganai, Anna Kapron-King, Kartic Subr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to make the iterative optimization in inverse problems more interpretable by using natural language explanations generated from optimizer traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems are widely used but their optimization processes remain cryptic to domain experts, despite advances in explainability of forward models.

Method: The approach involves instrumenting a differentiable simulator to emit natural language events during forward and backward passes, then using a Language Model to generate explanations from these events.

Result: The method is demonstrated with an illustrative optimization problem and a neural network training example, showing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully bridges the gap between cryptic optimization processes and human-interpretable explanations in inverse problems.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

*Xijun Li, Jiexiang Yang, Jinghao Wang, Bo Peng, Jianguo Yao, Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRCMP, a structure-aware LLM framework, integrates CO problem priors to improve solution quality and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for CO problems often ignore structural priors, leading to suboptimal solutions. Inspired by human experts, STRCMP leverages these priors for better performance.

Method: Combines GNNs for structural embeddings with LLMs to generate solver-specific codes, ensuring correctness and topology preservation, followed by evolutionary refinement.

Result: Outperforms five neural and LLM-based methods in solution optimality and efficiency across nine benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: STRCMP effectively integrates structural priors, demonstrating superior performance in CO problem-solving.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

*Boya Xiong, Shuo Wang, Weifeng Ge, Guanhua Chen, Yun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAMIX is an adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework for LLMs, outperforming baselines by optimizing bit allocation to minimize quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing delta-compression methods for LLMs either perform poorly at high compression ratios or rely on empirical bit allocation, lacking theoretical grounding.

Method: ADAMIX uses a mathematically derived mixed-precision strategy, formulating bit allocation as a 0/1 integer linear programming problem to minimize quantization error.

Result: ADAMIX outperforms Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% on AIME2024 and GQA tasks, respectively, with 7B models.

Conclusion: ADAMIX provides an effective, theoretically grounded solution for delta-compression in LLMs, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

*Dongyoung Kim, Jinsung Yoon, Jinwoo Shin, Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFP (Preference Feature Preservation) is a new framework to mitigate bias in LLM responses by preserving human preference feature distributions during online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards in preference learning can bias LLM responses, worsening with iterative online learning.

Method: PFP extracts preference features from offline data, trains a classifier, maps features for new inputs, and integrates them into LLM training via system prompts.

Result: PFP reduces bias in preference features during online learning and outperforms previous methods on LLM alignment benchmarks.

Conclusion: PFP effectively preserves human preference diversity, improving LLM alignment by explicitly handling varied preferences.

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

TL;DR: SectorE is a novel embedding model using polar coordinates to capture semantic hierarchies in knowledge graphs, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing region-based embedding models for knowledge graph completion often ignore semantic hierarchies in entities, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: SectorE embeds entities as points and relations as annular sectors in polar coordinates, combining modulus and phase to model inference patterns and relation attributes.

Result: SectorE achieves competitive performance on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 datasets, excelling in semantic modeling.

Conclusion: SectorE effectively addresses the semantic hierarchy gap in knowledge graph completion, demonstrating superior performance and potential for downstream applications.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

TL;DR: A novel batch-mode active learning policy reduces training data needs by 75% and improves accuracy for neutron diffractometry structure determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neutron diffractometry is computationally expensive; machine learning can speed it up but requires vast simulated data.

Method: Introduces an active learning policy using uncertainty sampling to prioritize uncertain examples, reducing data needs. Also designs a stream-based training workflow.

Result: Achieves 75% less training data usage with improved accuracy and 20% shorter training time without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning and streaming workflow significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy in neutron diffractometry.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-granularity segmentation and adaptability to evolving patterns, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments.

Method: PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns dynamically.

Result: PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning.

Conclusion: PromptTSS effectively addresses the challenges of multi-granularity segmentation and adaptability, demonstrating superior performance in hierarchical and dynamic time series analysis.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and

*Xue Zhou, Dapeng Man, Chen Xu, Fanyi Zeng, Tao Liu, Huan Wang, Shucheng He, Chaoyang Gao, Wu Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify data-policy coverage in offline RL, proposes a poisoning attack (CSDPC) targeting rare decision patterns, and shows its severe impact (90% performance drop with 1% poisoned data).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL studies focus on improving data-policy coverage but overlook security risks from insufficient coverage and lack multi-step analysis.

Method: The authors introduce a sequence-level concentrability coefficient, propose the CSDPC poisoning attack by targeting rare decision patterns, and validate it experimentally.

Result: Poisoning 1% of the dataset degrades agent performance by 90%, highlighting severe security risks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for analyzing and safeguarding offline RL security, especially against coverage-based attacks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oil and gas extraction faces challenges like blockages and hydrate formation, impacting efficiency. Machine learning offers a solution to detect and mitigate these issues.

Method: Employed decision trees, k-NN, and Naive Bayes on preprocessed data from Petrobras' GitHub repository, using scikit-learn for classification.

Result: Decision trees showed the highest accuracy (99.99%) in classifying hydrate formation.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively optimizes production efficiency by addressing flow assurance challenges.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable

Method: Developed uPVC-Net using a custom architecture and multi-source, multi-lead training on 8.3M beats from Holter monitors and wearable ECG patches.

Result: Achieved AUCs of 97.8%-99.1% on held-out datasets, with 99.1% on wearable single-lead ECG data.

Conclusion: uPVC-Net generalizes well across diverse leads and populations, making it suitable for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential
for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

### [359] [A Causal Lens for Learning Long-term Fair Policies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11242)
*Jacob Lear, Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for long-term fairness in reinforcement learning, decomposing fairness metrics into direct, delayed, and spurious effects, and introduces a method to balance fairness notions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems, beyond immediate bias, while meeting instantaneous fairness requirements.

Method: A general reinforcement learning framework measuring long-term fairness via qualification gain differences, decomposed into direct, delayed, and spurious effects using causal analysis.

Result: Identifies intrinsic connections between decomposed fairness components and benefit fairness, proposing a method to balance fairness notions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances fairness in dynamic systems, linking long-term fairness metrics to equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

*Ozan Baris Mulayim, Pengrui Quan, Liying Han, Xiaomin Ouyang, Dezhi Hong, Mario Bergés, Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs show limited generalizability in BEM tasks, performing slightly better than statistical models in some cases but struggling with covariates and complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability challenges in BEM by evaluating the potential of TSFMs, inspired by LLMs, to generalize across tasks and contexts.

Method: Evaluated TSFMs across four dimensions: zero-shot univariate forecasting, forecasting with covariates, zero-shot representation learning, and robustness to metrics and conditions.

Result: TSFMs perform marginally better than statistical models in univariate forecasting but struggle with covariates and complex environments. They excel in zero-shot representation learning but remain inferior in forecasting.

Conclusion: Targeted advancements in TSFM design, especially for covariates and temporal dynamics, are needed for scalable BEM solutions.

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

*Milad Hoseinpour, Vladimir Dvorkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A guided diffusion model is proposed to generate synthetic data, incorporating domain-specific constraints like Kirchhoff laws, with successful application in power systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy, security, and legal barriers in domains like healthcare, finance, and energy by creating synthetic data using generative models.

Method: Utilizing a guided diffusion model with gradient-based guidance to ensure domain constraints (e.g., Kirchhoff laws) are met during data synthesis.

Result: The model successfully generates statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively synthesizes domain-compliant synthetic data, with potential for broader application in tabular data domains.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [362] [Sampling Imbalanced Data with Multi-objective Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11315)
*Karen Medlin, Sven Leyffer, Krishnan Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOODS, a multi-objective optimization framework for handling imbalanced datasets, and a new metric to evaluate sampling methods, achieving improved F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced datasets lead to poor minority class classification; traditional methods like reweighting or resampling fail due to lack of diversity consideration.

Method: Proposes MOODS, a bilevel optimization framework for synthetic oversampling and majority undersampling, and introduces the ε/δ non-overlapping diversification metric.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance with 1-15% F1 score improvement due to enhanced diversity.

Conclusion: MOODS and the new metric effectively address imbalance and diversity, improving classification performance.

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

*Vispi Karkaria, Doksoo Lee, Yi-Ping Chen, Yue Yu, Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASNO, an attention-based spatio-temporal neural operator, to address challenges in SciML by combining separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions, enhancing interpretability and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to learn and predict evolving physical processes in SciML, especially under unknown or fluctuating environmental conditions, where traditional models lack interpretability and adaptability.

Method: Proposes ASNO, which integrates separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions, inspired by BDF, to handle varying external loads and improve interpretability.

Result: ASNO outperforms existing models on SciML benchmarks, showing promise for engineering applications, physics discovery, and interpretable ML.

Conclusion: ASNO effectively addresses the limitations of traditional models in SciML, offering improved interpretability, adaptability, and performance in unseen environments.

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

### [364] [The Sample Complexity of Parameter-Free Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11336)
*Jared Lawrence, Ari Kalinsky, Hannah Bradfield, Yair Carmon, Oliver Hinder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses stochastic convex optimization with unknown parameters, proposing two methods: a reliable model selection approach and a regularization-based method. These adapt to unknown problem structures, achieving near-optimal sample complexity and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle stochastic convex optimization when key parameters (e.g., distance to optimality) are unknown, avoiding overfitting and achieving adaptability.

Method: Two strategies are developed: (1) a reliable model selection method to tune learning rates without overfitting validation sets, and (2) a regularization-based method for unknown distance to optimality.

Result: The methods achieve near-optimal sample complexity and computational efficiency, with experiments showing reduced overfitting in few-shot learning tasks.

Conclusion: Combining these methods enables simultaneous adaptation to multiple problem structures, demonstrating improved performance in practical scenarios like few-shot learning.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

### [365] [Improving Group Robustness on Spurious Correlation via Evidential Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11347)
*Wenqian Ye, Guangtao Zheng, Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evidential Alignment uses uncertainty quantification to identify and mitigate spurious correlations in deep neural networks without needing group annotations, improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations, harming generalization and trustworthiness. Existing methods require costly annotations or deterministic models, which may miss biases.

Method: Proposes Evidential Alignment, leveraging uncertainty quantification (second-order risk minimization) and evidential calibration to debias models.

Result: Empirically improves group robustness across architectures and data modalities, scalable without spurious correlation annotations.

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment offers a principled, annotation-free solution to mitigate spurious correlations, enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

### [366] [Generalization Bound of Gradient Flow through Training Trajectory and Data-dependent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11357)
*Yilan Chen, Zhichao Wang, Wei Huang, Andi Han, Taiji Suzuki, Arya Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalization bound for gradient flow using the loss path kernel (LPK), which captures the training trajectory and provides tighter guarantees than static kernels like NTK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical generalization properties of gradient-based optimization methods, which are empirically successful but not fully theoretically explained.

Method: The authors use the loss path kernel (LPK) to analyze gradient flow, combining stability analysis and Rademacher complexity for uniform convergence.

Result: The LPK-based bound aligns with classical Rademacher complexity bounds, highlights the role of training loss gradients, and shows neural networks' feature learning capability.

Conclusion: The LPK provides tighter generalization guarantees, validated by experiments, and bridges the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

### [367] [EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11368)
*Pintu Kumar, Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) models for graph data, showing label noise depends on node degrees, and compares their impact on GNNs and noise-robust algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing node label noise models ignore graph topology, so EDN is proposed to address this gap by considering edge influence on label noise.

Method: Three EDN variants are explored, with experiments on graph datasets using GNNs and noise-robust algorithms.

Result: Two EDN variants cause more performance degradation than traditional models, verified statistically.

Conclusion: Incorporating EDN is crucial for reliable evaluation of noise-robust algorithms in graph-based learning.

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

*Bernardo P. Schaeffer, Ricardo M. S. Rosa, Glauco Valle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of stochasticity in score-based diffusion models on generation quality, using KL divergence bounds and numerical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stochasticity affects the sampling process in diffusion models and quantify error propagation under different stochasticity choices.

Method: Theoretical bounds on KL divergence are derived using log-Sobolev inequalities, complemented by numerical and analytical examples.

Result: Stochasticity acts as an error-correcting mechanism for exact scores but involves a trade-off between error correction and amplification for approximate scores.

Conclusion: The choice of stochasticity parameter influences performance, with stochasticity improving or worsening results based on score error structure.

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

*Riddhiman Raut, Romit Maulik, Shivam Barwey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIGNN is a new GNN architecture enhancing interpretability in deep learning surrogate models for scientific applications by using feature-specific pooling and mask-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs obscure spatial influences of features in multivariate tasks; FIGNN aims to clarify these influences.

Method: Introduces feature-specific pooling for independent spatial importance attribution and mask-based regularization to align interpretability with predictive error.

Result: FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance and reveals meaningful spatial patterns in atmospheric and fluid dynamics models.

Conclusion: FIGNN is a promising framework for interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

*Pradyut Sekhsaria, Marcel Mateos Salles, Hai Huang, Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT methods like LoRA can lead to models relying on spurious tokens for decision-making, enabling control via SSTI, with varying effects based on LoRA rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate catastrophic failures in PEFT methods, particularly the reliance on shortcut solutions and the potential for malicious control via SSTI.

Method: Applied SSTI across three model families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, Meta LLaMA-3) and four datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, Bias in Bios) to analyze model behavior.

Result: Single SSTI tokens can control decisions; reliance on spurious tokens scales with LoRA rank; higher ranks improve robustness against aggressive SSTI.

Conclusion: PEFT's efficiency comes with vulnerabilities like SSTI, requiring careful consideration of LoRA rank for robustness.

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

### [371] [Byzantine Outside, Curious Inside: Reconstructing Data Through Malicious Updates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11413)
*Kai Yue, Richeng Jin, Chau-Wai Wong, Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new threat model in federated learning (FL) called the 'maliciously curious client' is introduced, where a client manipulates gradients to infer peers' private data, bypassing existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL protocols are vulnerable to privacy leakage, even with robust aggregation or privacy mechanisms, prompting the need to explore novel client-side threats.

Method: The paper defines the threat model theoretically and develops a reconstruction algorithm combining gradient inversion with malicious update strategies.

Result: Experiments show the attack succeeds in reconstructing data, with some defenses unintentionally improving reconstruction quality by 10-15%.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical blind spot in FL defenses, urging reevaluation of current privacy and robustness mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

### [372] [Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11415)
*Linlin Wang, Tianqing Zhu, Laiqiao Qin, Longxiang Gao, Wanlei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework to study how poisoning attacks in RAG systems amplify biases in large language models, proposing defenses to mitigate such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on RAG systems overlooks how poisoning attacks can amplify biases, particularly in sensitive topics like gender stereotypes.

Method: The BRRA framework includes adversarial document generation, subspace projection for retrieval manipulation, and a cyclic feedback mechanism for bias amplification.

Result: Experiments show BRRA significantly increases biases in model outputs, and a dual-stage defense mechanism is proposed to counter the attack.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to address fairness in RAG systems due to the novel threat of bias amplification through poisoning attacks.

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPDiff, a diffusion model, designs high-affinity protein binders for arbitrary targets using SSINC architecture, outperforming baselines in pretraining and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of creating high-affinity protein binders without extensive lab testing drives the need for computational solutions like PPDiff.

Method: PPDiff uses SSINC, combining self-attention, kNN graph layers, and causal attention to model protein sequences and structures. It's trained on PPBench (706,360 complexes) and fine-tuned for mini-binder and antigen-antibody design.

Result: PPDiff achieves success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and 16.89% in pretraining and downstream tasks, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PPDiff demonstrates robust performance in designing protein binders, offering a scalable solution for biomedical and biotech applications.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to

*Jinhee Kim, Seoyeon Yoon, Taeho Lee, Joo Chan Lee, Kang Eun Jeon, Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TruncQuant is a novel training scheme for deep neural networks that enables flexible bit precision via bit-shifting, addressing challenges in truncation-aware training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying complex deep neural networks on edge devices requires reducing model size and latency, but current quantization-aware training schemes don't support truncation.

Method: Proposes TruncQuant, a truncation-ready training scheme aligning with truncation outputs for flexible bit precision during runtime.

Result: Demonstrates strong robustness across bit-width settings and integrates easily with existing quantization-aware frameworks.

Conclusion: TruncQuant offers a practical solution for adapting models to diverse hardware platforms with minimal overhead.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

*Abhishek Tyagi, Arjun Iyer, William H Renninger, Christopher Kanan, Yuhao Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaDiag is a structured sparse-to-sparse DST method that matches unstructured sparsity performance while enabling practical speedups on modern hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured sparsity often fails to achieve practical speedups on hardware, despite reducing parameter counts.

Method: DynaDiag enforces a diagonal sparsity pattern and uses a custom CUDA kernel for efficient computation.

Result: Achieves 3.13x inference speedup and 1.59x training speedup on GPUs without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: DynaDiag bridges the gap between theoretical sparsity benefits and practical hardware efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

*Haotian Ni, Yake Wei, Hang Liu, Gong Chen, Chong Peng, Hao Lin, Di Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a bias in self-attention models where one modality is overly favored, diminishing adaptability. It proposes Rolling Query (RollingQ) to restore balance and improve multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the diminishing adaptability of self-attention models in multimodal learning due to biased modality preference.

Method: Introduces Rolling Query (RollingQ) to rotate queries and break the self-reinforcing cycle of modality bias.

Result: RollingQ effectively restores dynamic adaptability and improves performance in multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: RollingQ enhances multimodal Transformers by reviving cooperation dynamics, validated across diverse experiments.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source

TL;DR: LearnAlign, a gradient-alignment-based method, improves data efficiency in RL post-training for LLMs by selecting representative reasoning data, reducing data needs while maintaining or enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the data inefficiency bottleneck in RL for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Method: Introduces LearnAlign, which selects learnable and representative training data based on success rate to avoid response-length bias in gradient norms.

Result: Significantly reduces training data requirements (e.g., 1,000 fewer points on GSM8K) with comparable or better performance (77.53% vs. 77.04%). Effective in staged RL settings.

Conclusion: Provides insights for data-efficient RL post-training and sets a foundation for optimizing reasoning data selection. Code will be released.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes is a growing global health concern, necessitating early detection and management. Machine learning offers promising tools for risk prediction.

Method: The study tested Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks on 768 samples.

Result: Neural Networks achieved the highest accuracy (78.57%), followed by Random Forests (76.30%).

Conclusion: Machine learning can serve as an effective early screening tool for diabetes, aiding timely intervention and reducing healthcare burdens.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to
avert or mitigate the severe health complications of this disease. Over recent
years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising potential in predicting

highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical
machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from
the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of the significant demographic
and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels
that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation
assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy
and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The
results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive
accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second
position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning
techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act
as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion
with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition,
this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely
intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health
outcomes and disease burden attributable to Diabetes on healthcare systems

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models were trained on VCUG images to objectively diagnose VUR severity, achieving high accuracy and identifying renal calyceal deformation as a key predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subjective grading of VUR introduces variability; machine learning offers a standardized alternative.

Method: Six models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Neural Network) were trained on 113 VCUG images using nine features, evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation.

Result: All models achieved accurate classifications (no false positives/negatives) with high sensitivity and AUC values. Renal calyceal deformation was a key predictor.

Conclusion: Machine learning provides an objective VUR assessment. Future work should expand datasets and refine features for clinical use.

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

### [381] [Task-Driven Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11511)
*Tung-Long Vuong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-driven framework for evaluating deep discrete representation learning (DRL), focusing on downstream tasks rather than just generation quality. It also provides theoretical insights into the trade-off between representational capacity and sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL frameworks (e.g., VQ-VAE) focus on generative settings, leaving the evaluation of discrete representations ambiguous. The paper aims to address this gap by examining DRL from a task-driven perspective.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework to assess the usefulness of discrete features in downstream tasks, with generation as one application. They also analyze the trade-off between representational capacity and sample complexity theoretically.

Result: The framework demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness across diverse applications, highlighting the practical benefits of discrete representations in task performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a clearer definition of discrete representation quality and offers insights into their impact on downstream tasks, advancing the understanding of DRL.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

*Wei Li, Yunyao Cheng, Xinli Hao, Chaohong Ma, Yuxuan Liang, Bin Yang, Christian S. Jensen, Xiaofeng Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift in time-series reasoning with LLMs, focusing on data primitives over task-specific models, introducing three alignment paradigms for efficient reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series reasoning approaches are costly and inflexible due to task-specific customization, overlooking intrinsic data primitives.

Method: Proposes three alignment paradigms (Injective, Bridging, Internal) based on time-series primitives (domain, characteristic, representation).

Result: Aligning LLMs with data primitives enables economical, flexible, and efficient time-series reasoning.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt alignment-oriented methods, and future research should explore these paradigms further.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

TL;DR: The paper interprets in-context learning (ICL) as implicit knowledge distillation (KD), providing a theoretical framework to explain its mechanisms and empirical phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanism behind ICL is poorly understood, limiting its interpretability, improvement, and reliable application.

Method: Proposes a theoretical perspective viewing ICL as implicit KD, deriving a Rademacher complexity-based generalization bound and analyzing bias growth with MMD.

Result: The framework explains empirical phenomena and unifies prior analyses, formalizing inference-time attention as distillation.

Conclusion: This is the first to formalize ICL as KD, offering theoretical insights for future prompt engineering and demonstration selection.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

*Zijian Wang, Peng Tao, Luonan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delayformer is a novel framework for predicting high-dimensional time-series data by using a multivariate spatiotemporal transformation and a shared Transformer encoder, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of high-dimensional, noisy time-series data is challenging due to nonlinearity and complex interactions. Existing methods, including deep learning, often fail in real-world scenarios.

Method: Delayformer uses a multivariate spatiotemporal transformation (mvSTI) to convert observed variables into delay-embedded states, cross-learned via a shared ViT encoder and distinct linear decoders.

Result: Delayformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting tasks on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Delayformer is a promising foundational model for time-series forecasting, with broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

*Xiaoyu Ma, Hao Chen, Yongjian Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes multimodal Data Remixing to address modality imbalance and enhance unimodal learning sufficiency in multimodal models, improving accuracy without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance in joint training of multimodal models, leading to modality laziness and clash.

Method: The method involves decoupling multimodal data, filtering hard samples per modality, and batch-level reassembling to align gradient directions and avoid cross-modal interference.

Result: The method improves accuracy by ~6.50% on CREMAD and ~3.41% on Kinetic-Sounds, integrating seamlessly with existing approaches.

Conclusion: Multimodal Data Remixing effectively mitigates modality imbalance and enhances unimodal learning, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel robust nonlinear filtering methods address noise and abnormalities in state estimation, extending to offline learning and smoothing, validated in diverse applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios involve unknown noise statistics and abnormalities, limiting conventional filtering approaches.

Method: Leverages Bayesian inference, Variational Inference, and Particle Filters, with theoretical limits studied via Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds.

Result: Validated in simulations and experiments (e.g., target tracking, pose graph optimization), showing performance gains.

Conclusion: Fundamental work with potential extensions to outlier-robust machine learning and generative AI challenges.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tradeoff between generalization and personalization in Foundation Models (FMs) through decentralized adaptation.

Method: Introduces FFMs to decouple shared knowledge from individual adaptations, leveraging recommendation systems for validation.

Result: FFMs enable personalized adaptive FMs while preserving user integrity and control.

Conclusion: FFMs offer a promising decentralized, user-centric approach for future personalized agents.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user

personalized agents.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates influence-based signals for debugging training data in ML models, finding that Self-Influence detects mislabeled samples but no signal effectively detects anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving training sample quality to enhance ML model reliability and performance by identifying mislabeled and anomalous samples.

Method: Comparative evaluation of influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence) under a common estimator (TraceIn) across data modalities and models.

Result: Self-Influence detects mislabeled samples, but no signal detects anomalies. Existing signals ignore training dynamics and suffer from influence cancellation.

Conclusion: Current influence-based signals are limited in detecting anomalies and need improvements to account for training dynamics and avoid influence cancellation.

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

TL;DR: KCES is a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework for GNNs that uses Graph Kernel Complexity to identify and prune adversarial edges, improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses often rely on heuristics or overfit to specific attacks, lacking efficiency and generalizability.

Method: KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC) to score edges based on their impact on GNN generalization, pruning high-scoring adversarial edges.

Result: KCES enhances GNN robustness, outperforms baselines, and integrates well with other defenses without requiring training.

Conclusion: KCES provides a principled, efficient, and plug-and-play solution for securing GNNs against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

### [390] [Model Organisms for Emergent Misalignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11613)
*Edward Turner, Anna Soligo, Mia Taylor, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models on narrowly harmful datasets causes broad misalignment, a surprising finding. Improved models and tools are developed to study this phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unexpected emergent misalignment in fine-tuned models and improve understanding of alignment risks.

Method: Use new narrowly misaligned datasets to create improved models, study misalignment across sizes and families, and identify a mechanistic phase transition.

Result: Achieved 99% coherence, worked with smaller models, and induced misalignment with a single LoRA adapter. Demonstrated robust misalignment across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment highlights gaps in alignment research. Clean model organisms and tools provide a foundation for future safety studies.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

### [391] [Machine Unlearning for Robust DNNs: Attribution-Guided Partitioning and Neuron Pruning in Noisy Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11615)
*Deliang Jin, Gang Chen, Shuo Feng, Yufeng Ling, Haoran Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework combining attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and targeted fine-tuning to mitigate noisy training data impact in DNNs, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN performance suffers from noisy or corrupted training data, and existing methods rely on impractical assumptions or extensive retraining.

Method: Uses gradient-based attribution to partition data, regression-based sensitivity analysis to prune noise-vulnerable neurons, and fine-tunes on high-quality data.

Result: Achieves ~10% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10 with label noise and reduces retraining time by up to 47%.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and scalable for robust generalization in noisy environments without full retraining or explicit noise modeling.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

*Anna Soligo, Edward Turner, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates emergent misalignment in fine-tuned large language models, using a minimal model to study and mitigate misaligned behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why fine-tuning causes broadly misaligned behaviors (emergent misalignment) and generalize beyond the training domain, addressing gaps in model alignment knowledge.

Method: Train a minimal model with 9 rank-1 adapters to misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, extract a 'misalignment direction,' and use it to ablate misaligned behaviors in other models.

Result: Different misaligned models converge to similar misalignment representations. Six adapters contribute to general misalignment, while two specialize in domain-specific misalignment.

Conclusion: Advancing understanding of emergent misalignment mechanisms can help mitigate misalignment in large language models more generally.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

*Daniel James Pitchforth, Matthew Rhys Jones, Samuel John Gibson, Elizabeth Jane Cross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces change-point kernels for Gaussian processes to dynamically balance physics and data reliance, optimizing model performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing physics and data in models is crucial to avoid over-reliance on inaccurate physics or underutilizing valuable physical knowledge. The challenge is compounded when this balance varies over time or conditions.

Method: Develops novel change-point kernels for Gaussian processes, allowing dynamic adjustment of physics reliance based on user-defined conditions or learned automatically. Includes noise variation for better uncertainty representation.

Result: Demonstrated through engineering case studies (wind loading on a bridge and aircraft wing strain), showing effective dynamic balance and improved uncertainty capture.

Conclusion: The proposed kernels provide a flexible and interpretable way to optimize physics-data balance, enhancing model performance and reliability in varying conditions.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

### [394] [Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11700)
*Katharina Limbeck, Lydia Mezrag, Guy Wolf, Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel graph pooling layers for GNNs that preserve graph structures and interpretability, outperforming existing methods in performance, spectral property retention, and accuracy across pooling ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pooling layers in GNNs often compromise graph structures and interpretability for task performance, leading to unreliable results. This work aims to address these issues.

Method: Proposes structure-aware pooling via edge collapses, leveraging diffusion geometry and diversity measures (magnitude and spread) to preserve graph metrics and structural diversity.

Result: The methods achieve superior performance in graph classification, preserve spectral properties, and maintain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed pooling layers offer a robust solution for GNNs, balancing performance, structural preservation, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

### [395] [Growing with Experience: Growing Neural Networks in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11706)
*Lukas Fehring, Marius Lindauer, Theresa Eimer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GrowNN is a method for training RL networks by progressively growing them during training, improving performance over static networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large networks for RL is challenging, limiting policy complexity. GrowNN aims to increase capacity while maintaining trainability.

Method: Start with a small network, then add layers without altering the encoded function, allowing the policy to grow in complexity.

Result: Experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show GrowNN outperforms static networks by up to 48% (MiniHack) and 72% (Ant).

Conclusion: GrowNN effectively enhances RL agent performance by dynamically increasing network capacity.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

*Antonin Joly, Nicolas Keriven, Aline Roumy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores graph coarsening by generalizing reduction matrices beyond pseudo-inverses of lifting matrices, reducing information loss (RSA) and improving performance in tasks like node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coarsening frameworks fix reduction and lifting matrices as pseudo-inverses, but their roles aren't symmetric. The paper aims to generalize reduction matrices to minimize RSA and enhance applications like graph neural networks.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy of admissible reduction matrices, explores their properties, and optimizes RSA through constrained optimization. Tests impact on node classification tasks.

Result: Shows RSA can be reduced by modifying reduction matrices for fixed lifting matrices, improving performance in practical applications.

Conclusion: Generalizing reduction matrices beyond pseudo-inverses offers flexibility and performance gains in graph coarsening, benefiting tasks like node classification.

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

*Markus Gambietz, Eva Dorschky, Altan Akat, Marcel Schöckel, Jörg Miehling, Anne D. Koelewijn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSPINNpose is a self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint kinematics and kinetics from IMU data without ground truth labels, offering accurate real-time biomechanical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current real-time methods rely on supervised learning with lab-measured ground truth, which is error-prone and impractical for real-world applications. SSPINNpose aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The method uses a physics-informed neural network to estimate joint dynamics from IMU data, optimizing physical plausibility through a physics model and virtual measurement data.

Result: SSPINNpose achieves accurate joint angle and moment estimations (RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%) with low latency (3.5 ms), and works robustly across sparse sensor configurations.

Conclusion: SSPINNpose is a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time biomechanical analysis in lab and field settings, reducing reliance on lab-based ground truth data.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

*Gregor Baer, Isel Grau, Chao Zhang, Pieter Van Gorp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates class-dependent effects in evaluating feature attribution methods in XAI, showing inconsistencies between perturbation-based and ground truth metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why class-dependent evaluation effects occur in XAI, questioning the reliability of perturbation-based metrics.

Method: Controlled experiments with synthetic time series data, varying feature types and class contrasts, comparing perturbation-based and ground truth metrics.

Result: Class-dependent effects arise even in simple scenarios, with weak correlations between evaluation methods, leading to contradictory assessments.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based metrics should be interpreted cautiously, and more comprehensive evaluation frameworks are needed.

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

TL;DR: SEC-bench is an automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on real security tasks, revealing performance gaps in PoC generation (18.0%) and vulnerability patching (34.0%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM agents lack realism, failing to capture the complexity of real-world security engineering tasks.

Method: SEC-bench uses a multi-agent scaffold to automate vulnerability dataset creation, PoC generation, and patching in isolated environments.

Result: LLM agents achieved low success rates: 18.0% in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the need for improved LLM agents to enhance their practicality and autonomy in security engineering.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TrustGLM, a study evaluating GraphLLMs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks across text, graph structure, and prompts, revealing significant susceptibility and proposing defense techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations, critical for high-stakes deployments.

Method: TrustGLM assesses GraphLLMs using state-of-the-art attack algorithms on text, graph structure, and prompts across six benchmark datasets.

Result: GraphLLMs are highly vulnerable to text and graph structure attacks, and prompt shuffling. Defense techniques like adversarial training show promise.

Conclusion: The study highlights GraphLLMs' vulnerabilities and proposes defenses, encouraging further research with an open-sourced library.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible method combining Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression to efficiently approximate probabilistic values (e.g., Shapley, Banzhaf) in explainable AI, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic values are crucial in explainable AI but computationally expensive. Current approximation methods (Monte Carlo, linear regression) have limitations, prompting the need for a more flexible and accurate approach.

Method: The proposed method combines Monte Carlo sampling with any function family (e.g., tree-based models like XGBoost) to compute probabilistic values efficiently while maintaining unbiased estimates.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing error significantly for Shapley and other probabilistic values.

Conclusion: The new approach offers superior accuracy and flexibility for estimating probabilistic values, advancing explainable AI tools.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

TL;DR: A meta-learning approach improves generalization for molecular prediction models by leveraging unlabeled data to bridge in-distribution and out-of-distribution gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular prediction models struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution compounds, a critical need in drug discovery, due to covariate shift and limited labeled data.

Method: Proposes a meta-learning-based approach using unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with covariate shift.

Conclusion: The meta-learning approach effectively addresses generalization challenges in molecular prediction, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Result: Improved QoS satisfaction (URLLC: 78.0% to 80.13%; eMBB: 71.44% to 73.21%) and higher interpretability precision.

Conclusion: The XRL framework effectively enhances resource allocation interpretability and QoS in vehicular networks.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular
networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By
integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an
attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our
reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in
vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our
approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation
process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention
mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC
services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved
from 71.44% to 73.21%.

*Ningyuan Huang, Miguel Sarabia, Abhinav Moudgil, Pau Rodriguez, Luca Zappella, Federico Danieli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demystifies Mamba's input selectivity, showing its advantages in function approximation, memory retention, and associative recall, with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how Mamba's input selectivity enhances performance over SSM predecessors and interacts with other operations in its architecture.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation of Mamba's S6 layer, focusing on function approximation, memory decay, and associative recall tasks.

Result: Mamba's S6 layer outperforms S4D in discontinuous function approximation, counters memory decay, and solves associative recall tasks effectively.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic understanding of Mamba, highlighting its strengths and suggesting areas for further improvement.

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

*Lu Zhang, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Gan Zheng, Guisheng Liao, Basil AsSadhan, Fabio Roli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a defense system for transformer-based modulation classification against adversarial attacks, introducing a compact transformer for efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are widely used but vulnerable to adversarial attacks in modulation classification, especially in resource-limited environments like IoT.

Method: A compact transformer is proposed, leveraging adversarial attention maps from robustly trained large transformers to enhance robustness.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques against white-box attacks like FGM and PGD, and reduces adversarial example transferability.

Conclusion: The proposed compact transformer offers a robust and efficient solution for modulation classification in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

TL;DR: MAS is a new framework for solving linear inverse problems by balancing prior and measurement information, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with conflicting signals in prior and measurement, especially under non-Gaussian or unknown noise.

Method: Proposes Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), unifying and extending approaches like DDNM and DAPS with an optimization perspective.

Result: MAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across tasks, handling Gaussian, unknown, or non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: MAS provides a flexible and effective solution for inverse problems, improving upon current techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A defense system called neural rejection is proposed to counter universal adversarial perturbations in radio signal classification, showing higher accuracy than undefended networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for radio signal classification is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, especially universal ones, which degrade performance.

Method: Proposes a neural rejection system and evaluates it using white-box universal adversarial perturbations.

Result: The neural rejection system defends against universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively mitigates the impact of universal adversarial perturbations in radio signal classification.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scalable algorithms for online learning and Bayesian inference in neural networks, combining frequentist and Bayesian filtering for efficient updates and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, online learning methods for neural networks in sequential decision-making tasks without requiring replay buffers or offline retraining.

Method: Combines low-rank updates for hidden layers and full-rank updates for the final layer, ensuring a well-defined posterior predictive distribution despite an improper posterior.

Result: Achieves a competitive balance between speed and accuracy in non-stationary contextual bandit and Bayesian optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a practical solution for online learning and decision-making in neural networks, with empirical validation of their effectiveness.

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

TL;DR: XAStruct is a machine learning framework for predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from XAS input, trained on a diverse dataset for broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAS interpretation relies on expert analysis and simulations, which are time-consuming and element-specific. Machine learning can accelerate this process but existing models are limited in scope.

Method: XAStruct uses deep neural networks for complex mappings and baseline models for simpler tasks, trained on a dataset spanning 70+ elements. It includes novel approaches for neighbor atom type prediction and mean nearest-neighbor distance regression.

Result: The model generalizes across diverse chemistries and bonding environments, though integrating tasks into one model degraded performance. Independent training ensured optimal accuracy.

Conclusion: XAStruct provides a scalable, extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference, with potential for broad impact in spectroscopy.

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeRL integrates on-policy tree search into RL for LLMs, eliminating the need for a separate reward model and improving efficiency with strategic branching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL with chain sampling lacks efficient exploration and dense rewards, while existing tree search methods in LLMs are under-explored.

Method: TreeRL incorporates on-policy tree search with intermediate supervision and strategic branching from high-uncertainty steps.

Result: TreeRL outperforms ChainRL on math and code reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: TreeRL highlights the potential of tree search in LLM RL and is open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

### [412] [Breaking Habits: On the Role of the Advantage Function in Learning Causal State Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11912)
*Miguel Suau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The advantage function in reinforcement learning reduces policy confounding by breaking spurious correlations, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing policy confounding, where agents exploit spurious correlations, hindering generalization.

Method: Using the advantage function to adjust action values relative to state representation, downweighting likely state-action pairs.

Result: Improved out-of-trajectory performance, supported by analytical and empirical evidence.

Conclusion: The advantage function mitigates policy confounding and enhances generalization in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

### [413] [Visual Pre-Training on Unlabeled Images using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11967)
*Dibya Ghosh, Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores casting self-supervised image pre-training as an RL problem, using a value function to learn features from unlabeled images by treating transformations as actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between RL and self-supervised learning by treating image pre-training as an RL problem, leveraging the similarity between value-based RL and crop-consistency methods.

Method: Proposes training a general value function in a dynamical system where an agent transforms images (e.g., crops, augmentations) to learn features, optionally using rewards from curated or weakly labeled data.

Result: Improved representations when training on unlabeled images from diverse datasets (EpicKitchens, COCO, CC12M).

Conclusion: The RL-based approach effectively shapes feature learning in self-supervised pre-training, offering flexibility with rewards and demonstrating success on real-world unlabeled data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based protocol for self-regulating cars improves traffic flow in free-flow road networks without new infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address traffic congestion in high-speed, signal-free environments where traditional methods fail.

Method: Integrates traffic flow theory, gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL framework, using super-segments to capture flow dynamics.

Result: Improves throughput by 5%, reduces delay by 13%, and decreases stops by 3% in simulations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable, ML-driven traffic management with smoother, congestion-resistant flow.

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Motivation: Existing methods treat compression and certified robustness separately, compromising efficiency or safety.

Method: Proposes CACTUS, a framework for unified training of compression-aware and certifiably robust models, applied to pruning and quantization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and certified performance for pruning and quantization across datasets.

Conclusion: CACTUS effectively balances efficiency and robustness, enabling safe deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained
environments must balance efficiency and robustness. Existing methods treat
compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either
efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training
Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during
training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed.
We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high
accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) for multi-dimensional data like DAGs, grids, and trees, addressing limitations of modern RNNs and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the constraints of sequential processing in modern RNNs (e.g., xLSTM, Mamba) and Transformers, which struggle with multi-dimensional data structures like images or graphs.

Method: Extends multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs using pLSTMs with Source, Transition, and Mark gates, enabling parallelization for DAGs. Efficient implementation for grids via einsum operations and two modes (P-mode and D-mode) to handle long-range dependencies.

Result: pLSTMs generalize well to larger image sizes and outperform Transformers in extrapolation tasks. They also show strong performance on molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: pLSTMs offer a scalable and parallelizable solution for multi-dimensional data, addressing long-range dependency issues and outperforming existing architectures in certain tasks.

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

Motivation: To reduce storage requirements for neural network training checkpoints while preserving model performance.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for storage-limited environments, balancing compression and recovery quality.

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer

network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIMSHIFT, a benchmark for evaluating neural surrogates for PDEs under unseen configurations, and extends domain adaptation techniques to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural surrogates for PDEs perform poorly on unseen configurations, while domain adaptation (DA) techniques in vision/language could bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces SIMSHIFT dataset (4 industrial tasks) and applies DA methods to neural surrogates, using source data and target descriptions (no ground truth).

Result: Experiments show challenges in out-of-distribution modeling but demonstrate DA's potential for improving neural surrogates in simulations.

Conclusion: Highlights the promise of DA for robust neural surrogates in industrial scenarios, though challenges remain.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMLoC is a memory-efficient framework for fine-tuning large models within inference memory limits, using emulators and LoRA correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large foundation models is expensive due to high memory overhead, limiting accessibility for domain-specific tasks.

Method: EMLoC uses activation-aware SVD to create a lightweight emulator, fine-tunes it with LoRA, and corrects misalignment via a novel compensation algorithm.

Result: EMLoC outperforms baselines across datasets and enables fine-tuning a 38B model on a 24GB GPU.

Conclusion: EMLoC provides a practical, efficient solution for individual users to adapt large models.

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the trustworthiness of FV explanations in DNNs, exposing their vulnerability to manipulation.

Method: Introduces Gradient Slingshots, shaping trajectories in off-distribution regions to force predefined visualizations.

Result: Demonstrates successful replacement of faithful FV with arbitrary targets across DNN architectures.

Conclusion: FV explanations can be untrustworthy; a defense method is proposed to mitigate this risk.

Abstract: Feature Visualization (FV) is a widely used technique for interpreting the
concepts learned by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which synthesizes input
patterns that maximally activate a given feature. Despite its popularity, the
trustworthiness of FV explanations has received limited attention. In this
paper, we introduce a novel method, Gradient Slingshots, that enables
manipulation of FV without modifying the model architecture or significantly
degrading its performance. By shaping new trajectories in the off-distribution
regions of the activation landscape of a feature, we coerce the optimization
process to converge in a predefined visualization. We evaluate our approach on
several DNN architectures, demonstrating its ability to replace faithfuls FV
with arbitrary targets. These results expose a critical vulnerability: auditors
relying solely on FV may accept entirely fabricated explanations. To mitigate
this risk, we propose a straightforward defense and quantitatively demonstrate
its effectiveness.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across toy and real-world benchmarks, handling long trajectories and sparse rewards.

Conclusion: EGFN is a simple yet powerful augmentation for GFlowNets, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a family of probabilistic generative
models that learn to sample compositional objects proportional to their
rewards. One big challenge of GFlowNets is training them effectively when
dealing with long time horizons and sparse rewards. To address this, we propose
Evolution guided generative flow networks (EGFN), a simple but powerful
augmentation to the GFlowNets training using Evolutionary algorithms (EA). Our
method can work on top of any GFlowNets training objective, by training a set
of agent parameters using EA, storing the resulting trajectories in the
prioritized replay buffer, and training the GFlowNets agent using the stored
trajectories. We present a thorough investigation over a wide range of toy and
real-world benchmark tasks showing the effectiveness of our method in handling
long trajectories and sparse rewards. We release the code at

*Weikang Wan, Ziyu Wang, Yufei Wang, Zackory Erickson, David Held*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffTORI uses differentiable trajectory optimization for deep RL and imitation learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'objective mismatch' in model-based RL by learning dynamics and cost functions end-to-end.

Method: Leverages differentiable trajectory optimization to compute gradients for learning dynamics and cost functions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on 15 RL and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional inputs.

Conclusion: DiffTORI effectively bridges the gap in model-based RL and imitation learning, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory
Optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep
Reinforcement and Imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and
widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics
function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in
differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients
of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a
result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be
learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of
prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned
to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient
loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI
for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with
high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward
policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15
model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional
image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods in both domains. Our code is available at

*Xinhao Zhang, Jinghan Zhang, Banafsheh Rekabdar, Yuanchun Zhou, Pengfei Wang, Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel feature generation method using LLMs and prompts addresses issues of explainability, applicability, and flexibility, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature generation methods lack explainability, applicability, and flexibility, limiting ML model deployment.

Method: Uses large language models (LLMs) and feature-generating prompts for dynamic, adaptive feature generation.

Result: Significantly superior to existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances interpretability, broadens applicability, and improves strategic flexibility in feature generation.

Abstract: The representation of feature space is a crucial environment where data
points get vectorized and embedded for subsequent modeling. Thus the efficacy
of machine learning (ML) algorithms is closely related to the quality of
feature engineering. As one of the most important techniques, feature
generation transforms raw data into an optimized feature space conducive to
model training and further refines the space. Despite the advancements in
automated feature engineering and feature generation, current methodologies
often suffer from three fundamental issues: lack of explainability, limited
applicability, and inflexible strategy. These shortcomings frequently hinder
and limit the deployment of ML models across varied scenarios. Our research
introduces a novel approach adopting large language models (LLMs) and
feature-generating prompts to address these challenges. We propose a dynamic
and adaptive feature generation method that enhances the interpretability of
the feature generation process. Our approach broadens the applicability across
various data types and tasks and offers advantages over strategic flexibility.
A broad range of experiments showcases that our approach is significantly
superior to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-DPO, a modified version of DPO, improves policy performance by controlling entropy, enhancing mode-seeking fitting, and outperforms DPO in tasks like mathematical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's reverse KL divergence may fail to capture reference distribution modes, hurting policy performance.

Method: H-DPO modifies DPO's loss calculation to control policy entropy, improving distribution sharpness.

Result: H-DPO outperforms DPO in tasks, especially in pass@k evaluations for mathematical tasks.

Conclusion: H-DPO is a simple, practical enhancement to DPO, promising for LLM training.

Abstract: In the post-training of large language models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach to achieve generation
aligned with human preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allows for
policy training with a simple binary cross-entropy loss without a reward model.
The objective of DPO is regularized by reverse KL divergence that encourages
mode-seeking fitting to the reference policy. Nonetheless, we indicate that
minimizing reverse KL divergence could fail to capture a mode of the reference
distribution, which may hurt the policy's performance. Based on this
observation, we propose a simple modification to DPO, H-DPO, which allows for
control over the entropy of the resulting policy, enhancing the distribution's
sharpness and thereby enabling mode-seeking fitting more effectively. In our
experiments, we show that H-DPO outperformed DPO across various tasks,
demonstrating superior results in pass@$k$ evaluations for mathematical tasks.
Moreover, H-DPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to
the loss calculation of DPO, which makes it highly practical and promising for
wide-ranging applications in the training of LLMs.

*Tzu-Heng Huang, Manjot Bilkhu, John Cooper, Frederic Sala, Javier Movellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Grad-Mimic, a model-based data selection method using the Mimic Score to improve training efficiency and performance by prioritizing high-quality samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale multimodal datasets often contain noise and bias, making data selection crucial. Existing methods are either heuristic-heavy or computationally expensive.

Method: Introduces the Mimic Score, a metric using reference model weights to assess sample usefulness. Grad-Mimic prioritizes samples based on gradient alignments with a target direction.

Result: Improves data efficiency, accelerates convergence, and boosts performance across six image datasets. CLIP models trained with 20.7% fewer steps and 4.7M fewer samples.

Conclusion: Mimic Score and Grad-Mimic offer an efficient, effective solution for data selection, complementing existing methods and enhancing model training.

Abstract: Multimodal models are trained on large-scale web-crawled datasets, which
often contain noise, bias, and irrelevant information. This motivates the use
of data selection techniques, which can be divided into model-free variants,
relying on heuristic rules and downstream datasets, and model-based approaches,
such as those using influence functions. The former can be expensive to design
and risks introducing unwanted dataset dependencies, while the latter are often
computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose an efficient, model-based
approach using the Mimic Score, a new data-quality metric that leverages the
weights of a reference model to assess the usefulness of individual samples for
training a new model. Our method relies on measuring alignments between
training gradients and a target direction induced by this reference model.
Building on the derived mimic scores, we develop Grad-Mimic: a framework that
prioritizes samples to learn, estimates overall sample utility, and creates
effective filters. Empirically, using mimic scores to guide training improves
data efficiency, accelerates convergence, yields consistent performance gains
across six image datasets, and enhances CLIP models with 20.7% fewer training
steps. Moreover, mimic score-based filters complement existing filtering
methods, e.g., training improved CLIP models with 4.7 million fewer samples
while offering accurate estimation of dataset quality.

canopy height maps are essential for understanding forest structure, estimating
above-ground biomass, and monitoring ecological disruptions. To this end, we
present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height
maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years

provide a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art methods and discuss key
challenges in leveraging FMs for improved anomaly detection. We also outline
future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AB-UPT is a novel neural surrogate modeling scheme for CFD simulations, addressing scalability, geometry complexity, and physics constraints with multi-branch operators, latent space simulation, and divergence-free formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial-scale CFD simulations face challenges like high-resolution meshes, complex geometries, and strict physics constraints, requiring scalable and accurate neural surrogate models.

Method: AB-UPT decouples geometry encoding and prediction via multi-branch operators, uses latent space simulation for scalability, and enforces physics consistency with divergence-free formulations.

Result: AB-UPT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on automotive CFD simulations (33K to 150M mesh cells), enforces hard physical constraints, and predicts fields in seconds on a single GPU.

Conclusion: AB-UPT offers a scalable, efficient, and physics-consistent solution for neural surrogate modeling in CFD, enabling simulation from CAD geometry without costly meshing.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for
transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics.
Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts
reaching the 100 millions, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex
geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume
interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must
satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we
introduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for
CFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and
prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to
high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent
space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity
outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free
formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of
surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33
thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field
architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the
physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling
divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained
on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and
volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of
our method enables neural simulation from a CAD geometry alone, omitting the
need for costly CFD meshing procedures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BalanceBenchmark, a toolkit for fair and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal imbalance algorithms, categorizing them into four groups and providing key insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons in existing multimodal imbalance solutions.

Method: Systematically categorizes algorithms into four groups, introduces BalanceBenchmark with datasets and metrics, and develops a modular toolkit for standardized evaluation.

Result: Identifies key insights into the performance, balance degree, and complexity of different method groups.

Conclusion: The analysis aims to inspire future efficient approaches and foundation models for multimodal imbalance problems.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained attention for its capacity to integrate
information from different modalities. However, it is often hindered by the
multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others
remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to
alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this
paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance
algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate
imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we
introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used
multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives:
performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we
have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the
experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using
BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the
characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of
performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such
analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance
problem in the future, as well as foundation models. The code of the toolkit is

*Megan Tjandrasuwita, Chanakya Ekbote, Liu Ziyin, Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates implicit alignment in multimodal learning, exploring when and why it emerges and its impact on performance, finding it depends on data characteristics like modality similarity and information balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergence of implicit alignment in multimodal learning and its reliability as a performance indicator.

Method: Comprehensive empirical investigation analyzing data characteristics such as modality similarity and information balance.

Result: Alignment emergence and its performance impact depend on data traits; it's not universally beneficial and can vary by task and dataset.

Conclusion: Alignment's usefulness is context-dependent, helping practitioners decide when to prioritize it for optimal performance.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning is fundamentally about transforming
incomparable modalities into comparable representations. While prior research
primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted
learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found
that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance
can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental
questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal
learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and
(2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive
empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment
and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data
characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree
of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and
unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that
alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance
varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners
determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or,
in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance. Code is released
at https://github.com/MeganTj/multimodal_alignment.

*Jinbo Wang, Mingze Wang, Zhanpeng Zhou, Junchi Yan, Weinan E, Lei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a sharpness disparity across Transformer blocks and proposes Blockwise Learning Rate (LR) to tailor LR per block, achieving faster LLM pre-training and lower loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding differences and interactions among Transformer blocks is crucial, and the observed sharpness disparity motivates a tailored learning rate strategy.

Method: Proposes Blockwise LR, integrating it into AdamW and Adam-mini, to customize LR based on each block's sharpness.

Result: Achieves lower terminal loss, nearly 2x speedup, and 2x memory saving in GPT-2 and LLaMA models.

Conclusion: Exploiting sharpness disparity improves LLM training efficiency, demonstrating potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Transformers consist of diverse building blocks, such as embedding layers,
normalization layers, self-attention mechanisms, and point-wise feedforward
networks. Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these
blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity
across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists
throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose
Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's
sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating
Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly
$2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration
across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 2B and datasets
of OpenWebText, MiniPile, and C4. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into
Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of
Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These
results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to
improve LLM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of IL (distribution shift, imitation gaps) and the lack of standardized RL frameworks in AD, enabling generalizable AD policies.

Method: V-Max extends Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator, using ScenarioNet's approach for fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.

Result: V-Max provides necessary tools for RL in AD, facilitating large-scale experimentation.

Conclusion: V-Max aims to make RL practical for AD by offering a standardized and efficient research framework.

Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable

benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from
inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption
in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLIDER improves expert routing in model merging by combining global semantic context with local token-level decisions, enhancing performance on held-in tasks without sacrificing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoErging methods prioritize generalization over held-in task performance, lacking global semantic context for expert selection.

Method: Proposes GLIDER, a multi-scale routing mechanism with a global semantic router (using LLM reasoning) and a local router for token-level decisions.

Result: GLIDER achieves better held-in performance and maintains strong generalization on held-out tasks in T5-based models for T0 and FLAN tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-scale routing with LLM-driven semantic reasoning is crucial for effective MoErging, balancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation
of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to particular domains. This
has enabled the creation of powerful and adaptive routing-based "Model
MoErging" methods with the goal of using expert modules to create an aggregate
system with improved performance or generalization. However, existing MoErging
methods often prioritize generalization to unseen tasks at the expense of
performance on held-in tasks, which limits its practical applicability in
real-world deployment scenarios. We observe that current token-level routing
mechanisms neglect the global semantic context of the input task. This
token-wise independence hinders effective expert selection for held-in tasks,
as routing decisions fail to incorporate the semantic properties of the task.
To address this, we propose, Global and Local Instruction Driven Expert Router
(GLIDER) that integrates a multi-scale routing mechanism, encompassing a
semantic global router and a learned local router. The global router leverages
LLM's advanced reasoning capabilities for semantic-related contexts to enhance
expert selection. Given the input query and LLM, the router generates semantic
task instructions that guide the retrieval of the most relevant experts across
all layers. This global guidance is complemented by a local router that
facilitates token-level routing decisions within each module, enabling finer
control and enhanced performance on unseen tasks. Our experiments using
T5-based models for T0 and FLAN tasks demonstrate that GLIDER achieves
substantially improved held-in performance while maintaining strong
generalization on held-out tasks. We also perform ablations experiments to dive
deeper into the components of GLIDER. Our experiments highlight the importance
of our multi-scale routing that leverages LLM-driven semantic reasoning for
MoErging methods.

*Sungbin Shin, Dongyeop Lee, Maksym Andriushchenko, Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM's effectiveness in improving generalization relies on overparameterization, which enlarges the solution space and enhances implicit bias, particularly in noisy or sparse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how overparameterization affects SAM's performance, given its reliance on flatness variability in the solution space.

Method: Analyzed SAM under varying overparameterization levels through empirical experiments and theoretical analysis.

Result: SAM benefits consistently from overparameterization, achieving faster convergence and more uniform Hessian moments compared to SGD.

Conclusion: Overparameterization critically enhances SAM's effectiveness, especially in noisy or sparse scenarios, but requires sufficient regularization.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has attracted considerable attention for
its effectiveness in improving generalization in deep neural network training
by explicitly minimizing sharpness in the loss landscape. Its success, however,
relies on the assumption that there exists sufficient variability of flatness
in the solution space-a condition commonly facilitated by overparameterization.
Yet, the interaction between SAM and overparameterization has not been
thoroughly investigated, leaving a gap in understanding precisely how
overparameterization affects SAM. Thus, in this work, we analyze SAM under
varying degrees of overparameterization, presenting both empirical and
theoretical findings that reveal its critical influence on SAM's effectiveness.
First, we conduct extensive numerical experiments across diverse domains,
demonstrating that SAM consistently benefits from overparameterization. Next,
we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay between the enlarged solution
space and increased implicit bias resulting from overparameterization.
Furthermore, we show that this effect is particularly pronounced in practical
settings involving label noise and sparsity, and yet, sufficient regularization
is necessary. Last but not least, we provide other theoretical insights into
how overparameterization helps SAM achieve minima with more uniform Hessian
moments compared to SGD, and much faster convergence at a linear rate.

*Jialin Yu, Yuxiang Zhou, Yulan He, Nevin L. Zhang, Junchi Yu, Philip Torr, Ricardo Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses latent-confounded shifts in AI by proposing causal fine-tuning to decompose inputs into spurious and causal features, enabling better adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent-confounded shifts create spurious correlations in AI models, especially when fine-tuning pre-trained models on confounded data, leading to deployment vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors frame causal fine-tuning as an identification problem, decomposing inputs into spurious and causal representations, and formalize assumptions for identification.

Result: Experiments on semi-synthetic benchmarks show the method outperforms black-box domain generalization baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling causal structure during fine-tuning improves adaptation to latent-confounded shifts.

Abstract: Adapting to latent-confounded shifts remains a core challenge in modern AI.
These shifts are propagated via latent variables that induce spurious,
non-transportable correlations between inputs and labels. One practical failure
mode arises when fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models on confounded data
(e.g., where certain text tokens or image backgrounds spuriously correlate with
the label), leaving models vulnerable at deployment. We frame causal
fine-tuning as an identification problem and pose an explicit causal model that
decomposes inputs into low-level spurious features and high-level causal
representations. Under this family of models, we formalize the assumptions
required for identification. Using pre-trained language models as a case study,
we show how identifying and adjusting these components during causal
fine-tuning enables automatic adaptation to latent-confounded shifts at test
time. Experiments on semi-synthetic benchmarks derived from real-world problems
demonstrate that our method outperforms black-box domain generalization
baselines, illustrating the benefits of explicitly modeling causal structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the challenge of confounded datasets in continual learning, where spurious correlations vary over tasks. It formalizes continual confounders, shows their impact, and presents the ConCon dataset to evaluate continual learning methods, which fail to ignore confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of confounded datasets in continual learning, where spurious correlations hinder generalization across tasks.

Method: The authors formalize continual confounders, create the ConCon dataset (a CLEVR-based continually confounded dataset), and evaluate standard continual learning methods on it.

Result: Standard continual learning methods fail to ignore confounders in the ConCon dataset, highlighting the difficulty of mitigating spurious correlations in sequential tasks.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for robust continual learning methods to handle confounders, as current approaches struggle with spurious correlations in sequential settings.

Abstract: A dataset is confounded if it is most easily solved via a spurious
correlation, which fails to generalize to new data. In this work, we show that,
in a continual learning setting where confounders may vary in time across
tasks, the challenge of mitigating the effect of confounders far exceeds the
standard forgetting problem normally considered. In particular, we provide a
formal description of such continual confounders and identify that, in general,
spurious correlations are easily ignored when training for all tasks jointly,
but it is harder to avoid confounding when they are considered sequentially.
These descriptions serve as a basis for constructing a novel CLEVR-based
continually confounded dataset, which we term the ConCon dataset. Our
evaluations demonstrate that standard continual learning methods fail to ignore
the dataset's confounders. Overall, our work highlights the challenges of
confounding factors, particularly in continual learning settings, and
demonstrates the need for developing continual learning methods to robustly
tackle these.

Method: Uses a separate neural network (value network) trained on a small base model, then integrates it with larger pre-trained models during inference. Investigates best practices for pre-training weights and connection schemes.

Result: Demonstrates broad transferability across models of varying sizes, vocabularies, and families, sometimes matching full fine-tuning performance. Explores methods to enhance transferability and prevent overfitting.

Conclusion: The value network offers a scalable and efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, with potential for wide applicability.

Abstract: As post-training processes utilize increasingly large datasets and base
models continue to grow in size, the computational demands and implementation
challenges of existing algorithms are escalating significantly. In this paper,
we propose modeling the changes at the logits level during post-training using
a separate neural network (i.e., the value network). After training this
network on a small base model using demonstrations, this network can be
seamlessly integrated with other pre-trained models during inference, enables
them to achieve similar capability enhancements. We systematically investigate
the best practices for this paradigm in terms of pre-training weights and
connection schemes. We demonstrate that the resulting value network has broad
transferability across pre-trained models of different parameter sizes within
the same family, models undergoing continuous pre-training within the same
family, and models with different vocabularies across families. In certain
cases, it can achieve performance comparable to full-parameter fine-tuning.
Furthermore, we explore methods to enhance the transferability of the value
model and prevent overfitting to the base model used during training.

TL;DR: RioT is a method to prevent spurious correlations in deep time series models by interacting with explanations in time and frequency domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep time series models often rely on spurious correlations, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: RioT interacts with model explanations in both time and frequency domains to constrain the model and avoid spurious correlations.

Result: RioT effectively guides models toward reliable decision-making in time series classification and forecasting, validated on datasets including P2S.

Conclusion: RioT addresses shortcuts in time series models by leveraging dual-domain explanations, improving reliability.

Abstract: Deep time series models often suffer from reliability issues due to their
tendency to rely on spurious correlations, leading to incorrect predictions. To
mitigate such shortcuts and prevent "Clever-Hans" moments in time series
models, we introduce Right on Time (RioT), a novel method that enables
interacting with model explanations across both the time and frequency domains.
By incorporating feedback on explanations in both domains, RioT constrains the
model, steering it away from annotated spurious correlations. This dual-domain
interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing shortcuts in time
series datasets. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of RioT in
guiding models toward more reliable decision-making across popular time series
classification and forecasting datasets, as well as our newly recorded dataset
with naturally occuring shortcuts, P2S, collected from a real mechanical
production line.

TL;DR: T1 scales reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs by encouraging exploration and understanding inference scaling, achieving superior performance on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches rely on imitation learning and struggle with test-time scaling, while RL offers potential but yields modest improvements.

Method: Initialize LLM with synthesized chain-of-thought data, scale RL training via oversampling for diversity, and examine inference scaling.

Result: T1 exhibits inference scaling behavior and outperforms on math reasoning benchmarks without additional verification.

Conclusion: T1 demonstrates effective RL scaling and improved performance, offering a simple strategy for inference scaling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches mainly rely on imitation
learning and struggle to achieve effective test-time scaling. While
reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for enabling self-exploration, recent
attempts yield modest improvements in complex reasoning. In this paper, we
present T1 to scale RL by encouraging exploration and understand inference
scaling. We first initialize the LLM using synthesized chain-of-thought data
that integrates trial-and-error and self-verification. To scale RL training, we
promote increased sampling diversity through oversampling. We demonstrate that
T1 with open LLMs as its base exhibits inference scaling behavior and achieves
superior performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. More
importantly, we present a simple strategy to examine inference scaling, where
increased inference budgets directly lead to T1's better performance without
any additional verification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BSR is a new matrix factorization method for differentially private model training, reducing computational overhead while matching performance of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for differentially private model training are computationally expensive due to demanding optimization problems.

Method: BSR leverages properties of the standard matrix square root to efficiently handle large-scale problems, with analytical expressions for specific scenarios like SGD with momentum and weight decay.

Result: BSR matches the performance of existing methods while eliminating their computational overhead, proven by theoretical bounds and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: BSR is a computationally efficient alternative to current matrix factorization techniques for differentially private model training.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for differentially private model training
are based on matrix factorization techniques. However, these methods suffer
from high computational overhead because they require numerically solving a
demanding optimization problem to determine an approximately optimal
factorization prior to the actual model training. In this work, we present a
new matrix factorization approach, BSR, which overcomes this computational
bottleneck. By exploiting properties of the standard matrix square root, BSR
allows to efficiently handle also large-scale problems. For the key scenario of
stochastic gradient descent with momentum and weight decay, we even derive
analytical expressions for BSR that render the computational overhead
negligible. We prove bounds on the approximation quality that hold both in the
centralized and in the federated learning setting. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate that models trained using BSR perform on par with the best existing
methods, while completely avoiding their computational overhead.

*Yihe Dong, Lorenzo Noci, Mikhail Khodak, Mufan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of self-attention in Transformers by comparing standard models to variants with frozen components and introducing MixiT, a simplified model with fixed random attention. MixiT performs well on algorithmic tasks but underperforms on retrieval tasks, highlighting the importance of input-dependent attention and specialized circuits like induction heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how much of the Transformer's performance gains are due to self-attention and which aspects of it are crucial for different tasks.

Method: Compare standard Transformers to variants with frozen MLP layers or attention projectors. Introduce MixiT, a model with fixed random attention coefficients, to isolate attention's contribution.

Result: MixiT matches standard Transformers on algorithmic tasks but underperforms on retrieval tasks. Frozen key and query projectors can still form induction heads and perform well on language modeling.

Conclusion: Architectural heterogeneity, with distinct components contributing complementary inductive biases, is crucial for solving diverse tasks.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide
range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization,
and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction.
While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we
question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be
attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in
which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention
projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate
the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer --
a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely
random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation
or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the
performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks,
especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on
memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent
attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms.
We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as
induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and
exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we
find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to
form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling.
Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where
distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for
solving different classes of tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates multi-bitwidth quantization for DeepSeek-R1 and V3, finding 4-bit quantization viable for single-machine deployment with minimal performance loss. It also introduces DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit method outperforming traditional variants and matching 4-bit performance in many tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High demand for local deployment of DeepSeek models due to service unavailability and privacy concerns, but memory constraints challenge single-machine setups.

Method: Quantitative evaluation of multi-bitwidth quantization, proposing DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization method.

Result: 4-bit quantization maintains performance close to FP8, enabling single-machine deployment. DQ3_K_M outperforms traditional 3-bit methods and matches 4-bit performance in most tasks.

Conclusion: DQ3_K_M offers a practical solution for local deployment, balancing performance and resource efficiency, with implementations available for NVIDIA and Huawei hardware.

Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally,
possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some
organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment
offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration
exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization
is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However,
it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being
quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of
multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key
findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance
degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard
NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization
method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various
benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach
in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment
configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of
DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing
optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

### [443] [A Rescaling-Invariant Lipschitz Bound Based on Path-Metrics for Modern ReLU Network Parameterizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15006)
*Antoine Gonon, Nicolas Brisebarre, Elisa Riccietti, Rémi Gribonval*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Lipschitz inequality for ReLU-DAG architectures ensures robustness to weight perturbations, is rescaling-invariant, and applies to diverse networks like ResNets and CNNs. It sharpens prior bounds and aids in pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robustness guarantees for neural networks are limited to simple architectures and fail under neuron-wise rescaling, necessitating a more general and invariant bound.

Method: The paper introduces a Lipschitz inequality based on the ℓ¹-path-metric of weights, applicable to ReLU-DAG architectures (e.g., ResNets, CNNs) with convolutions, skip connections, and batch-normalization.

Result: The new bound is rescaling-invariant, sharper than prior bounds, and computable in two forward passes. A symmetry-aware pruning criterion derived from it matches classical pruning performance while being immune to rescaling.

Conclusion: The proposed Lipschitz bound improves robustness guarantees for diverse architectures and enables practical applications like pruning without sensitivity to rescaling.

Abstract: Robustness with respect to weight perturbations underpins guarantees for
generalization, pruning and quantization. Existing guarantees rely on Lipschitz
bounds in parameter space, cover only plain feed-forward MLPs, and break under
the ubiquitous neuron-wise rescaling symmetry of ReLU networks. We prove a new
Lipschitz inequality expressed through the $\ell^1$-path-metric of the weights.
The bound is (i) rescaling-invariant by construction and (ii) applies to any
ReLU-DAG architecture with any combination of convolutions, skip connections,
pooling, and frozen (inference-time) batch-normalization -- thus encompassing
ResNets, U-Nets, VGG-style CNNs, and more. By respecting the network's natural
symmetries, the new bound strictly sharpens prior parameter-space bounds and
can be computed in two forward passes. To illustrate its utility, we derive
from it a symmetry-aware pruning criterion and show -- through a
proof-of-concept experiment on a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNet -- that its
pruning performance matches that of classical magnitude pruning, while becoming
totally immune to arbitrary neuron-wise rescalings.

*Michael K. Chen, Xikun Zhang, Jiaxing Huang, Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a method to improve LLMs' ability to learn coherent concepts by enabling multi-token training during fine-tuning, outperforming traditional next-token methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with forming high-level concepts due to fragmented token-based learning, limiting human-like understanding and reasoning.

Method: CAFT is a novel multi-token training approach that allows LLMs to learn sequences spanning multiple tokens during fine-tuning, enhancing concept-aware learning.

Result: Experiments show CAFT significantly improves performance over conventional methods in tasks like text summarization and protein design.

Conclusion: CAFT democratizes multi-token learning benefits, suggesting broader implications for ML research, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

*Antoine Gonon, Léon Zheng, Pascal Carrivain, Quoc-Tung Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new GPU kernel for Kronecker-sparse (KS) matrix multiplication reduces memory overheads, achieving speedups and energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GPU kernels for KS matrices suffer from high data movement costs, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes a fused, output-stationary GPU kernel to eliminate memory-bound tensor permutations.

Result: Achieves median speedup of x1.4, 15% lower energy, and up to 22% latency reduction in models like ViT-S/16.

Conclusion: The new kernel significantly improves efficiency and performance for KS matrix operations, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Kronecker-sparse (KS) matrices -- whose supports are Kronecker products of
identity and all-ones blocks -- underpin the structure of Butterfly and Monarch
matrices and offer the promise of more efficient models. However, existing GPU
kernels for KS matrix multiplication suffer from high data movement costs, with
up to 50% of time spent on memory-bound tensor permutations. We propose a
fused, output-stationary GPU kernel that eliminates these overheads, reducing
global memory traffic threefold. Across 600 KS patterns, our kernel achieves in
FP32 a median speedup of x1.4 and lowers energy consumption by 15%. A simple
heuristic based on KS pattern parameters predicts when our method outperforms
existing ones. We release all code at github.com/PascalCarrivain/ksmm,
including a PyTorch-compatible KSLinear layer, and demonstrate in FP32
end-to-end latency reductions of up to 22% in ViT-S/16 and 16% in GPT-2 medium.

*Amrith Setlur, Matthew Y. R. Yang, Charlie Snell, Jeremy Greer, Ian Wu, Virginia Smith, Max Simchowitz, Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (e3) to improve LLM reasoning by enabling in-context exploration, allowing models to extrapolate beyond their training token budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models fail to extrapolate well, limiting their performance on harder problems with longer "thinking" times.

Method: The e3 method involves chaining asymmetric skills (e.g., verification and generation), leveraging negative gradients for exploration, and using a curriculum to align task difficulty with token budget.

Result: The e3-1.7B model achieves top scores on AIME'25 and HMMT'25, extrapolates to 2x the training budget, and improves pass@1 and pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: In-context exploration via e3 enhances LLM reasoning and extrapolation, offering a scalable solution for complex tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of physical equation discrepancies in data-driven spatiotemporal field generation.

Method: Develops HMT-PF with a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporates unstructured grid input, and uses physics-informed fine-tuning with self-supervised learning.

Result: The model performs well in generating fields, and the fine-tuning mechanism effectively reduces physical errors.

Conclusion: HMT-PF successfully improves physical consistency in spatiotemporal field generation, validated by the MSE-R evaluation method.

Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation
discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields
through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation
model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A
fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to
effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation
residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient
evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning
process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical
consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show
that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating
spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further
reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is
developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.

TL;DR: A novel framework for multimodal diffusion models enables native generation of coupled data across modalities without relying on external preprocessing, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joint multimodal data generation rely heavily on external preprocessing, which is problematic for limited-data applications.

Method: Proposes a framework with a decoupled noise schedule for each modality, allowing unconditional and modality-conditioned generation in a single model.

Result: Empirically validated for text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, showing competitive performance.

Conclusion: The framework lifts restrictions of external preprocessing, enabling efficient multimodal data generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

TL;DR: A novel hierarchical feature fusion method improves early ASD detection in children by analyzing code-switched speech (English-Hindi) with 98.75% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising prevalence of ASD highlights the need for better early detection methods to address this public health concern.

Method: Uses Transformer Encoders to fuse acoustic, paralinguistic, and linguistic features from a code-switched speech corpus (CoSAm) of 61 recordings.

Result: Achieves 98.75% accuracy with hierarchical fusion of features.

Conclusion: The method enhances early ASD detection robustness and precision, demonstrating high potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro-developmental challenge,
presenting a spectrum of difficulties in social interaction, communication, and
the expression of repetitive behaviors in different situations. This increasing
prevalence underscores the importance of ASD as a major public health concern
and the need for comprehensive research initiatives to advance our
understanding of the disorder and its early detection methods. This study
introduces a novel hierarchical feature fusion method aimed at enhancing the
early detection of ASD in children through the analysis of code-switched speech
(English and Hindi). Employing advanced audio processing techniques, the
research integrates acoustic, paralinguistic, and linguistic information using
Transformer Encoders. This innovative fusion strategy is designed to improve
classification robustness and accuracy, crucial for early and precise ASD
identification. The methodology involves collecting a code-switched speech
corpus, CoSAm, from children diagnosed with ASD and a matched control group.
The dataset comprises 61 voice recordings from 30 children diagnosed with ASD
and 31 from neurotypical children, aged between 3 and 13 years, resulting in a
total of 159.75 minutes of voice recordings. The feature analysis focuses on
MFCCs and extensive statistical attributes to capture speech pattern
variability and complexity. The best model performance is achieved using a
hierarchical fusion technique with an accuracy of 98.75% using a combination of
acoustic and linguistic features first, followed by paralinguistic features in
a hierarchical manner.

TL;DR: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates MoE models more than dense models, especially as MoEs become sparser. A new metric 'target efficiency' helps analyze SD acceleration tradeoffs, achieving up to 2.29x speedup in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of speculative decoding (SD) for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which outperform dense models, and to address limitations in current SD research.

Method: Developed a theoretical model to analyze SD tradeoffs, introduced 'target efficiency' as a new metric, and conducted experiments on MoE models like Qwen2-57B-A14B.

Result: MoE models benefit more from SD than dense models, especially with sparsity. Experiments showed up to 2.29x speedup at medium batch sizes.

Conclusion: This work provides a new perspective for accelerating MoE inference, particularly in private serving scenarios, and introduces a metric to better understand SD acceleration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many
applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great
potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better
performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used
technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been
considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate
that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than
dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in
MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be
effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in
SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current
SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms,
changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD
acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we
introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects,
thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD
acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this
work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing
solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for
Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.

TL;DR: The paper improves the learning rate for training two-layer ReLU³ PINNs from O(λ₀) to O(1/‖H∞‖₂), showing faster GD convergence. It further analyzes NGD, achieving O(1) learning rate and quadratic convergence for smooth activations, independent of the Gram matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the slow training process of GD in over-parameterized two-layer neural networks due to poor learning rate dependence on sample size and Gram matrix.

Method: Analyze GD and NGD for two-layer ReLU³ PINNs, focusing on learning rate improvements and convergence rates. Theoretical analysis includes Gram matrix properties and smooth activation functions.

Result: GD's learning rate improves to O(1/‖H∞‖₂), but convergence remains tied to the Gram matrix. NGD achieves O(1) learning rate and quadratic convergence, independent of the Gram matrix.

Conclusion: NGD outperforms GD for training PINNs with smooth activations, offering faster convergence and independence from the Gram matrix, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: In the context of over-parameterization, there is a line of work
demonstrating that randomly initialized (stochastic) gradient descent (GD)
converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the
quadratic loss function. However, the learning rate of GD for training
two-layer neural networks exhibits poor dependence on the sample size and the
Gram matrix, leading to a slow training process. In this paper, we show that
for training two-layer $\text{ReLU}^3$ Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs), the learning rate can be improved from $\mathcal{O}(\lambda_0)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(1/\|\bm{H}^{\infty}\|_2)$, implying that GD actually enjoys a
faster convergence rate. Despite such improvements, the convergence rate is
still tied to the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix, leading to slow
convergence. We then develop the positive definiteness of Gram matrices with
general smooth activation functions and provide the convergence analysis of
natural gradient descent (NGD) in training two-layer PINNs, demonstrating that
the learning rate can be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and at this rate, the convergence
rate is independent of the Gram matrix. In particular, for smooth activation
functions, the convergence rate of NGD is quadratic. Numerical experiments are
conducted to verify our theoretical results.

Motivation: To apply OEL principles to cybersecurity for creating more robust and generalizable autonomous agents, overcoming domain-specific challenges.

Method: A training approach inspired by OEL, focusing on consistent task representation across diverse network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals.

Result: Demonstrates that OEL principles can enhance robustness and generalization in cyber defense agents.

Conclusion: The work aims to influence AI research in cybersecurity by advocating for diverse tasks with consistent representations in benchmarks and gyms.

Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve
broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop
artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization.
However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL,
applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity
applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous
network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL
principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber
defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several
technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task
representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a
consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the
learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors,
and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that
applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers
develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they
consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we
propose in our work.

### [453] [LeMON: Learning to Learn Multi-Operator Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16168)
*Jingmin Sun, Zecheng Zhang, Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes pretraining and fine-tuning strategies for multi-operator learning in PDE-solving, enabling a single model to predict diverse operators with limited data and even zero-shot prediction. It also introduces meta-learning and low-rank adaptation for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-operator learning by leveraging multi-operator learning for broader adaptability and efficiency in solving PDEs, especially with limited data or resources.

Method: Pretraining with diverse PDE families, fine-tuning for new operators, PDE-agnostic meta-learning for better initialization, and low-rank adaptation for computational efficiency.

Result: The model outperforms single-operator networks, achieves zero-shot prediction, and scales well with more operator families.

Conclusion: Multi-operator learning with pretraining and fine-tuning is a powerful, adaptable, and efficient approach for PDE-solving tasks.

Abstract: Single-operator learning involves training a deep neural network to learn a
specific operator, whereas recent work in multi-operator learning uses an
operator embedding structure to train a single neural network on data from
multiple operators. Thus, multi-operator learning is capable of predicting a
range of operators within one model. In this work, we propose pretraining and
fine-tuning strategies for solving PDEs using multi-operator learning. One key
aspect is that by increasing the number of families of operators used in
pretraining, a PDE foundation model can be fine-tuned to downstream tasks
involving new PDEs with a limited number of samples, thus outperforming single
operator neural networks. Specifically, a multi-operator learning model
pre-trained with data from diverse PDE families can predict unseen operators
after fine-tuning with only a limited number of operators from the new family,
enabling them to serve as a data-free PDE solver. We also show that the
proposed training and fine-tuning method is able to predict new operators in
zero-shot prediction without samples. Additionally, we introduce a PDE-agnostic
meta-learning algorithm to improve the adaptability of the model to various
PDEs by providing a better parameter initialization process. To address the
needs of applications with limited computing resources, we explore low-rank
adaptation methods that reduce computational costs while enhancing solver
accuracy. Lastly, by examining the scaling law with respect to the number of
operator families, we establish and highlight its potential for broad
adaptation in PDE-solving tasks.

*Gabriel Thompson, Kai Yue, Chau-Wai Wong, Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a decentralized federated learning (DFL) method using neural tangent kernel (NTK) to improve accuracy and convergence in heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of statistical heterogeneity in DFL by leveraging NTK for better performance.

Method: Combines NTK-based evolution with model averaging to exploit inter-client model deviation.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy and 4.6x faster convergence in heterogeneous settings compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Validated across datasets and topologies, the method is robust and generalizable.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a collaborative machine learning
framework for training a model across participants without a central server or
raw data exchange. DFL faces challenges due to statistical heterogeneity, as
participants often possess data of different distributions reflecting local
environments and user behaviors. Recent work has shown that the neural tangent
kernel (NTK) approach, when applied to federated learning in a centralized
framework, can lead to improved performance. We propose an approach leveraging
the NTK to train client models in the decentralized setting, while introducing
a synergy between NTK-based evolution and model averaging. This synergy
exploits inter-client model deviation and improves both accuracy and
convergence in heterogeneous settings. Empirical results demonstrate that our
approach consistently achieves higher accuracy than baselines in highly
heterogeneous settings, where other approaches often underperform.
Additionally, it reaches target performance in 4.6 times fewer communication
rounds. We validate our approach across multiple datasets, network topologies,
and heterogeneity settings to ensure robustness and generalization.

### [455] [NOBLE -- Neural Operator with Biologically-informed Latent Embeddings to Capture Experimental Variability in Biological Neuron Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04536)
*Luca Ghafourpour, Valentin Duruisseaux, Bahareh Tolooshams, Philip H. Wong, Costas A. Anastassiou, Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOBLE is a neural operator framework that predicts neural dynamics by learning from biophysically realistic neuron models, addressing variability and computational inefficiencies in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuron modeling approaches struggle with limited data availability, intrinsic variability, and computational inefficiency, while deep learning lacks biophysical complexity.

Method: NOBLE learns a mapping from neuron features to somatic voltage responses, trained on biophysically realistic models, and predicts neural dynamics with variability.

Result: NOBLE achieves a 4200x speedup over numerical solvers and generates synthetic neurons with trial-to-trial variability, validated on real experimental data.

Conclusion: NOBLE advances neuron modeling by capturing intrinsic variability and biophysical complexity, enabling applications in neuroAI, neuromorphic architectures, and brain circuit studies.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

### [456] [Federated Learning Nodes Can Reconstruct Peers' Image Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04661)
*Ethan Wilson, Kai Yue, Chau-Wai Wong, Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training while keeping data private, but gradient-sharing steps can leak data. This paper shows that even honest-but-curious clients can reconstruct peers' images via gradient inversion, using diffusion models to improve quality, highlighting privacy risks and the need for stronger safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the vulnerability of FL to client-side data reconstruction attacks, even by honest-but-curious peers, and demonstrate the severity of privacy risks using gradient inversion and diffusion models.

Method: The study leverages gradient inversion techniques to reconstruct private images from consecutive updates in FL, enhanced by state-of-the-art diffusion models for better perceptual quality.

Result: A single client can silently reconstruct peers' private images, with diffusion models improving recognizability, proving significant privacy risks in FL.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the urgent need for robust privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL to mitigate client-side attacks and protect sensitive data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning framework
that enables multiple nodes to train models on their local data and
periodically average weight updates to benefit from other nodes' training. Each
node's goal is to collaborate with other nodes to improve the model's
performance while keeping its training data private. However, this framework
does not guarantee data privacy. Prior work has shown that the gradient-sharing
steps in FL can be vulnerable to data reconstruction attacks from an
honest-but-curious central server. In this work, we show that an
honest-but-curious node/client can also launch attacks to reconstruct peers'
image data through gradient inversion, presenting a severe privacy risk. We
demonstrate that a single client can silently reconstruct other clients'
private images using diluted information available within consecutive updates.
We leverage state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the perceptual quality
and recognizability of the reconstructed images, further demonstrating the risk
of information leakage at a semantic level. This highlights the need for more
robust privacy-preserving mechanisms that protect against silent client-side
attacks during federated training.

*Haifeng Sun, Yu Xiong, Runze Wu, Xinyu Cai, Changjie Fan, Lan Zhang, Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fast-DataShapley is a one-pass training method for efficiently calculating Shapley values of training data without retraining, improving performance and speed significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to protect data providers' rights and fairly reward them, coupled with the high computational cost of traditional Shapley value methods, drives the development of a more efficient solution.

Method: Leverages weighted least squares to train a reusable explainer model, avoiding retraining for new test samples. Introduces three methods to reduce training overhead.

Result: Achieves over 2.5x performance improvement and two orders of magnitude faster training speed compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley provides an efficient and scalable solution for evaluating data contributions, addressing computational and practical challenges.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a neural SDE model with a VAE framework for time-series change point detection, using a Gaussian prior for the initial state and iterative parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve modeling of change points in time-series data with distribution shifts using neural SDEs, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Uses a VAE framework with neural SDEs, Gaussian prior for initial state, and iterative updates for parameters and change points via likelihood or sequential likelihood ratio test.

Result: Effective modeling of parametric SDEs and real datasets with distribution shifts, validated theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a robust and expressive approach for detecting change points in time-series data.

Abstract: In this work, we explore modeling change points in time-series data using
neural stochastic differential equations (neural SDEs). We propose a novel
model formulation and training procedure based on the variational autoencoder
(VAE) framework for modeling time-series as a neural SDE. Unlike existing
algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only
necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic
process, rather than a Wiener process prior on the entire latent stochastic
process. We develop two methodologies for modeling and estimating change points
in time-series data with distribution shifts. Our iterative algorithm
alternates between updating neural SDE parameters and updating the change
points based on either a maximum likelihood-based approach or a change point
detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We provide a
theoretical analysis of this proposed change point detection scheme. Finally,
we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of
our proposed model, showing that it can effectively model both classical
parametric SDEs and some real datasets with distribution shifts.

*Nan Sun, Xixun Lin, Zhiheng Zhou, Yanmin Shang, Zhenlin Cheng, Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EviSEC, an OOD detector for dynamic graphs, uses Evidential Deep Learning and spectrum-aware contrastive learning to address bias, variance, and score homogenization issues in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods for static graphs face challenges like high bias/variance and score homogenization, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic graph scenarios.

Method: Proposes EviSEC, combining evidential neural networks (for uncertainty modeling) and spectrum-aware augmentation (to generate OOD approximations and widen score gaps).

Result: EviSEC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs, as validated by experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses key challenges in OOD detection for dynamic graphs, offering a robust solution.

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

*Sabina J. Sloman, Julien Martinelli, Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses negative transfer in transfer learning by introducing a Bayesian perspective and a method called PROMPT, which leverages proxy information without requiring prior knowledge of source data or target observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of negative transfer, where transfer learning worsens target task performance, by refining prior knowledge about non-transferable causes in source data.

Method: Introduces PROMPT, a proxy-informed robust method for probabilistic transfer learning, which uses indirect information (e.g., human feedback) and does not need prior knowledge of source data or target observations.

Result: Theoretical results show PROMPT's effectiveness even with noisy proxy information, mitigating negative transfer without dependency on proxy informativeness.

Conclusion: PROMPT provides a practical solution to negative transfer, especially in scenarios with unobserved task differences or limited target data access.

Abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging
prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't,
between different data sources. Transfer learning is a framework for specifying
and refining this knowledge about sets of source (training) and target
(prediction) data. A challenging open problem is addressing the empirical
phenomenon of negative transfer, whereby the transfer learner performs worse on
the target data after taking the source data into account than before. We first
introduce a Bayesian perspective on negative transfer, and then a method to
address it. The key insight from our formulation is that negative transfer can
stem from misspecified prior information about non-transferable causes of the
source data. Our proposed method, proxy-informed robust method for
probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), does not require prior knowledge of
the source data (the data sources may be "unknown"). PROMPT is thus applicable
when differences between tasks are unobserved, such as in the presence of
latent confounders. Moreover, the learner need not have access to observations
in the target task (may not have the ability to "fine-tune"), and instead makes
use of proxy (indirect) information. Our theoretical results show that the
threat of negative transfer does not depend on the informativeness of the proxy
information, highlighting the usefulness of PROMPT in cases where only noisy
indirect information, such as human feedback, is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes LwPTV for layer-wise pruning of task vectors in multi-task learning, improving out-of-domain performance without compromising in-domain results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model merging methods focus on in-domain performance, neglecting out-of-domain efficacy.

Method: Uses saliency scores to measure parameter redundancy, enabling layer-wise pruning of task vectors.

Result: Significant improvements in out-of-domain performance while maintaining in-domain capabilities.

Conclusion: LwPTV enhances flexibility and performance in multi-task learning, compatible with existing merging methods.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task
datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance
across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple
independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing
the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of
MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on
enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their
efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV
(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the
redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve
mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task
vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding
layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly
integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their
performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD
performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

*Sharmila Karumuri, Lori Graham-Brady, Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PI-Latent-NO integrates physics into Latent DeepONet for efficient, physics-consistent predictions in high-dimensional PDE systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of data-driven Latent DeepONet by incorporating physical laws for robustness in data-scarce settings.

Method: Two coupled DeepONets: Latent-DeepONet learns low-dimensional representations, Reconstruction-DeepONet maps back to physical space with PDE constraints via automatic differentiation.

Result: Memory and compute-efficient, near-constant scaling with problem size, faster than traditional physics-informed models, validated on high-dimensional PDEs.

Conclusion: PI-Latent-NO offers accurate, scalable, and real-time prediction for complex physical systems by embedding physics into learning.

Abstract: Deep operator network (DeepONet) has shown significant promise as surrogate
models for systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling
accurate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. However, for
complex, high-dimensional systems, these models often require heavily
overparameterized networks, leading to long training times and convergence
difficulties. Latent DeepONet addresses some of these challenges by introducing
a two-step approach: first learning a reduced latent space using a separate
model, followed by operator learning within this latent space. While efficient,
this method is inherently data-driven and lacks mechanisms for incorporating
physical laws, limiting its robustness and generalizability in data-scarce
settings. In this work, we propose PI-Latent-NO, a physics-informed latent
neural operator framework that integrates governing physics directly into the
learning process. Our architecture features two coupled DeepONets trained
end-to-end: a Latent-DeepONet that learns a low-dimensional representation of
the solution, and a Reconstruction-DeepONet that maps this latent
representation back to the physical space. By embedding PDE constraints into
the training via automatic differentiation, our method eliminates the need for
labeled training data and ensures physics-consistent predictions. The proposed
framework is both memory and compute-efficient, exhibiting near-constant
scaling with problem size and demonstrating significant speedups over
traditional physics-informed operator models. We validate our approach on a
range of high-dimensional parametric PDEs, showcasing its accuracy,
scalability, and suitability for real-time prediction in complex physical
systems.

*Chaoyang Zhou, Shunyu Liu, Zengmao Wang, Di Wang, Rong-Cheng Tu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using generation probabilities to refine reward models in LLMs, improving generalization and performance on benchmarks like RewardBench, DPO policies, and BON verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models rely on coarse-grained response-level scores, limiting their ability to generalize and identify specific response components that correlate with rewards.

Method: The authors leverage generation probabilities to enforce reward consistency across response processes, introducing intra-trajectory consistency regularization under a Bayesian framework.

Result: The refined reward model outperforms on RewardBench, enhances DPO-aligned policies, and improves BON verification results.

Conclusion: Fine-grained reward modeling via generation probabilities significantly improves LLM performance and generalization.

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs),
particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or
inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores
of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However,
since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the
reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response
trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization
on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation
probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response
trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate
across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward
learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an
intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes
with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards.
We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model,
improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward
model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned
policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification
results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

TL;DR: Tensor-Var integrates kernel CME with 4D-Var to linearize nonlinear dynamics, enabling convex optimization in a learned feature space, improving accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D-Var faces computational costs and imperfect mappings; DL lacks guarantees. Tensor-Var addresses these by combining kernel CME with 4D-Var.

Method: Uses kernel CME to linearize dynamics, enabling convex optimization in feature space. Deep features are learned via neural networks for scalability.

Result: Outperforms conventional and DL hybrid 4D-Var in accuracy with 10-20x speedup in chaotic systems and weather prediction.

Conclusion: Tensor-Var provides a linear, scalable solution for 4D-Var with theoretical guarantees, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Variational data assimilation estimates the dynamical system states by
minimizing a cost function that fits the numerical models with the
observational data. Although four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var)
is widely used, it faces high computational costs in complex nonlinear systems
and depends on imperfect state-observation mappings. Deep learning (DL) offers
more expressive approximators, while integrating DL models into 4D-Var is
challenging due to their nonlinearities and lack of theoretical guarantees in
assimilation results. In this paper, we propose Tensor-Var, a novel framework
that integrates kernel conditional mean embedding (CME) with 4D-Var to
linearize nonlinear dynamics, achieving convex optimization in a learned
feature space. Moreover, our method provides a new perspective for solving
4D-Var in a linear way, offering theoretical guarantees of consistent
assimilation results between the original and feature spaces. To handle
large-scale problems, we propose a method to learn deep features using neural
networks within the Tensor-Var framework. Experiments on chaotic systems and
global weather prediction with real-time observations show that Tensor-Var
outperforms conventional and DL hybrid 4D-Var baselines in accuracy while
achieving a 10- to 20-fold speed improvement.

*Xinhao Zhang, Jinghan Zhang, Fengran Mo, Dongjie Wang, Yanjie Fu, Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEKA, a knowledge augmentation method for active knowledge transfer, improving computational efficiency and transfer learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel in analogical learning and knowledge transfer, but models struggle with autonomously identifying and retrieving useful knowledge. The goal is to enable models to actively access and learn from knowledge.

Method: LEKA extracts key info from target domain text, retrieves relevant data from external libraries, and aligns it with target domain data in feature space and marginal probability measures.

Result: Extensive experiments show LEKA reduces computational costs, automates data alignment, and outperforms traditional methods in transfer learning.

Conclusion: LEKA effectively enhances knowledge transfer by actively retrieving and harmonizing relevant knowledge, offering significant improvements over conventional approaches.

Abstract: Humans excel in analogical learning and knowledge transfer and, more
importantly, possess a unique understanding of identifying appropriate sources
of knowledge. From a model's perspective, this presents an interesting
challenge. If models could autonomously retrieve knowledge useful for transfer
or decision-making to solve problems, they would transition from passively
acquiring to actively accessing and learning from knowledge. However, filling
models with knowledge is relatively straightforward -- it simply requires more
training and accessible knowledge bases. The more complex task is teaching
models about which knowledge can be analogized and transferred. Therefore, we
design a knowledge augmentation method, LEKA, for knowledge transfer that
actively searches for suitable knowledge sources that can enrich the target
domain's knowledge. This LEKA method extracts key information from the target
domain's textual information, retrieves pertinent data from external data
libraries, and harmonizes retrieved data with the target domain data in feature
space and marginal probability measures. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments across various domains and demonstrate
significant improvements over traditional methods in reducing computational
costs, automating data alignment, and optimizing transfer learning outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in SOMs during sequential tasks.

Method: Introduces a saturation mechanism to adjust learning rate and neighborhood radius for neurons based on accumulated information.

Result: Improves knowledge retention by freezing well-trained neurons and focusing learning on underutilized areas.

Conclusion: SatSOM enhances SOMs for continual learning by mitigating forgetting through adaptive saturation.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

TL;DR: A novel method for learning energy-based models (EBMs) in large discrete spaces by jointly training an energy model and its log-partition, enabling tractable optimization without MCMC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact MLE for EBMs is intractable due to partition function computation, especially in combinatorially-large spaces like sets or permutations.

Method: Jointly learn an energy model and its log-partition as neural networks, providing a tractable objective for stochastic gradient descent.

Result: The approach recovers optimal MLE solutions theoretically and extends to Fenchel-Young losses, enabling sparsemax loss optimization.

Conclusion: Demonstrated effectiveness in multilabel classification and label ranking, offering a scalable and flexible framework for EBMs.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for parameterizing
probability distributions using neural networks. However, learning EBMs by
exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally intractable, due to the
need to compute the partition function (normalization constant). In this paper,
we propose a novel formulation for approximately learning probabilistic EBMs in
combinatorially-large discrete spaces, such as sets or permutations. Our key
idea is to jointly learn both an energy model and its log-partition, both
parameterized as a neural network. Our approach not only provides a novel
tractable objective criterion to learn EBMs by stochastic gradient descent
(without relying on MCMC), but also a novel means to estimate the log-partition
function on unseen data points. On the theoretical side, we show that our
approach recovers the optimal MLE solution when optimizing in the space of
continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that our approach naturally extends
to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, allowing us to obtain the first
tractable method for optimizing the sparsemax loss in combinatorially-large
spaces. We demonstrate our approach on multilabel classification and label
ranking.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The logistic loss (a.k.a. cross-entropy loss) is one of the most popular loss
functions used for multiclass classification. It is also the loss function of
choice for next-token prediction in language modeling. It is associated with
the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence and the softargmax operator. In this
work, we propose to construct new convex loss functions based on
$f$-divergences. Our loss functions generalize the logistic loss in two
directions: i) by replacing the KL divergence with $f$-divergences and ii) by
allowing non-uniform reference measures. We instantiate our framework for
numerous $f$-divergences, recovering existing losses and creating new ones. By
analogy with the logistic loss, the loss function generated by an
$f$-divergence is associated with an operator, that we dub $f$-softargmax. We
derive a novel parallelizable bisection algorithm for computing the
$f$-softargmax associated with any $f$-divergence. On the empirical side, one
of the goals of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of loss functions
beyond the classical cross-entropy in a language model setting, including on
pre-training, post-training (SFT) and distillation. We show that the loss
function generated by the $\alpha$-divergence (which is equivalent to Tsallis
$\alpha$-negentropy in the case of unit reference measures) with $\alpha=1.5$
performs well across several tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoNNect is a differentiable regularizer for sparse NN training, ensuring connectivity and approximating L0 regularization, improving pruning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like layer collapse in pruning techniques and enhance connectivity in sparse neural networks.

Method: Introduces CoNNect, a differentiable regularizer that approximates L0 regularization and integrates with existing pruning methods.

Result: CoNNect improves classical pruning strategies and enhances state-of-the-art one-shot pruners like DepGraph and LLM-pruner.

Conclusion: CoNNect effectively ensures connectivity and sparsity, advancing pruning techniques in neural networks.

Abstract: Pruning encompasses a range of techniques aimed at increasing the sparsity of
neural networks (NNs). These techniques can generally be framed as minimizing a
loss function subject to an $L_0$ norm constraint. This paper introduces
CoNNect, a novel differentiable regularizer for sparse NN training that ensures
connectivity between input and output layers. We prove that CoNNect
approximates $L_0$ regularization, guaranteeing maximally connected network
structures while avoiding issues like layer collapse. Moreover, CoNNect is
easily integrated with established structural pruning strategies. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that CoNNect can improve classical pruning strategies
and enhance state-of-the-art one-shot pruners, such as DepGraph and LLM-pruner.

*Yousef El-Laham, Niccolò Dalmasso, Svitlana Vyetrenko, Vamsi K. Potluru, Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel probabilistic mixup framework for conditional density estimation, outperforming standard mixup variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixup regularization is popular but underexplored for conditional density estimation and probabilistic ML.

Method: Proposes probabilistic fusion via log-linear pooling for exponential family data and extends mixup to intermediate network layers.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show superior performance over existing mixup variants.

Conclusion: The framework effectively adapts mixup for probabilistic tasks, enhancing generalization.

Abstract: In recent years, mixup regularization has gained popularity as an effective
way to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by
training on convex combinations of training data. While many mixup variants
have been explored, the proper adoption of the technique to conditional density
estimation and probabilistic machine learning remains relatively unexplored.
This work introduces a novel framework for mixup regularization based on
probabilistic fusion that is better suited for conditional density estimation
tasks. For data distributed according to a member of the exponential family, we
show that likelihood functions can be analytically fused using log-linear
pooling. We further propose an extension of probabilistic mixup, which allows
for fusion of inputs at an arbitrary intermediate layer of the neural network.
We provide a theoretical analysis comparing our approach to standard mixup
variants. Empirical results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
benefits of our proposed framework compared to existing mixup variants.

*Peter Sharpe, Rishikesh Ranade, Kaustubh Tangsali, Mohammad Amin Nabian, Ram Cherukuri, Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-based initialization reduces transient CFD simulation costs by 50% compared to traditional methods, using hybrid ML-predictions and uniform flow integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High compute costs of transient CFD simulations due to error advection and data sampling for time-averaged quantities.

Method: Three ML-based initialization strategies evaluated on a 17M-cell unsteady RANS simulation, focusing on hybrid ML-predictions with potential/uniform flow.

Result: 50% reduction in time-to-convergence, with hybrid ML strategies matching steady RANS performance at lower cost.

Conclusion: Hybrid-ML workflow is practical for industrial CFD acceleration, leveraging existing ML models without solver modifications.

Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for
many industrial applications, but suffer from high compute costs relative to
steady-state simulations. This is due to the need to: (a) reach statistical
steadiness by physically advecting errors in the initial field sufficiently far
downstream, and (b) gather a sufficient sample of fluctuating flow data to
estimate time-averaged quantities of interest. We present a machine
learning-based initialization method that aims to reduce the cost of transient
solve by providing more accurate initial fields. Through a case study in
automotive aerodynamics on a 17M-cell unsteady incompressible RANS simulation,
we evaluate three proposed ML-based initialization strategies against existing
methods. Here, we demonstrate 50% reductions in time-to-convergence compared to
traditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Two ML-based
initialization strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a hybrid method
combining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) an approach
integrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD
solvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally-expensive
steady RANS initializations, while requiring far less wall-clock time to
compute the initialization field. Notably, these improvements are achieved
using an ML model trained on a different dataset of diverse automotive
geometries, demonstrating generalization capabilities relevant to specific
industrial application areas. Because this Hybrid-ML workflow only modifies the
inputs to an existing CFD solver, rather than modifying the solver itself, it
can be applied to existing CFD workflows with relatively minimal changes; this
provides a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations using
existing ML surrogate models.

TL;DR: Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) improves Hopfield network storage capacity, achieving perfect recall even when patterns exceed neurons, and outperforms Hebbian and linear methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hebbian learning limits storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron ratio ~0.14), prompting the need for a better method.

Method: Proposes KLR, which uses kernels to map patterns to high-dimensional space, enhancing separability and learning dual variables.

Result: KLR achieves perfect recall with pattern-to-neuron ratios up to 1.5 and improves noise robustness.

Conclusion: KLR significantly outperforms Hebbian and linear logistic regression, offering superior storage capacity and robustness.

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron
ratio around 0.14). We propose Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) learning.
Unlike linear methods, KLR uses kernels to implicitly map patterns to
high-dimensional feature space, enhancing separability. By learning dual
variables, KLR dramatically improves storage capacity, achieving perfect recall
even when pattern numbers exceed neuron numbers (up to ratio 1.5 shown), and
enhances noise robustness. KLR demonstrably outperforms Hebbian and linear
logistic regression approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives error bounds for neural ODEs with quadratic nonlinearities, showing expressivity comes from depth rather than operation complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how depth contributes to the expressivity of deep learning architectures, using simple neural ODEs as a model.

Method: Analyzing neural ODEs with quadratic nonlinearities to derive quantitative approximation error bounds.

Result: Expressivity in such models arises from depth (iterative composition) rather than complex elementary operations.

Conclusion: Depth is a key factor in the capabilities of deep learning architectures, as demonstrated by simple neural ODEs.

Abstract: This work focuses on deriving quantitative approximation error bounds for
neural ordinary differential equations having at most quadratic nonlinearities
in the dynamics. The simple dynamics of this model form demonstrates how
expressivity can be derived primarily from iteratively composing many basic
elementary operations, versus from the complexity of those elementary
operations themselves. Like the analog differential analyzer and universal
polynomial DAEs, the expressivity is derived instead primarily from the "depth"
of the model. These results contribute to our understanding of what depth
specifically imparts to the capabilities of deep learning architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AtlasD, a method for discovering local symmetries (atlas equivariance) in functions, improving accuracy over global symmetry methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetry discovery methods focus on global transformations, missing local symmetries and potentially misrepresenting true symmetry groups.

Method: AtlasD trains local predictor networks and learns a Lie group basis for equivariance, recovering local symmetries.

Result: AtlasD successfully discovers local symmetry groups in top-quark tagging and PDE experiments, enhancing downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Local symmetry discovery via AtlasD serves as a useful inductive bias, improving outcomes in climate segmentation and vision tasks.

Abstract: Existing symmetry discovery methods predominantly focus on global
transformations across the entire system or space, but they fail to consider
the symmetries in local neighborhoods. This may result in the reported symmetry
group being a misrepresentation of the true symmetry. In this paper, we
formalize the notion of local symmetry as atlas equivariance. Our proposed
pipeline, automatic local symmetry discovery (AtlasD), recovers the local
symmetries of a function by training local predictor networks and then learning
a Lie group basis to which the predictors are equivariant. We demonstrate
AtlasD is capable of discovering local symmetry groups with multiple connected
components in top-quark tagging and partial differential equation experiments.
The discovered local symmetry is shown to be a useful inductive bias that
improves the performance of downstream tasks in climate segmentation and vision
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines bias in ML-driven house price prediction models, focusing on racial and ethnic fairness, and evaluates bias mitigation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Housing is vital for well-being, but ML models for price prediction may exhibit racial/ethnic bias, risking inequity. This study aims to assess and mitigate such bias.

Method: Develops ML models using structural and neighborhood attributes, evaluates fairness across privileged groups, and tests pre- and in-processing bias mitigation techniques.

Result: ML models show bias toward protected attributes (race/ethnicity). In-processing mitigation is generally more effective than pre-processing.

Conclusion: Addressing bias in ML-driven housing models is crucial for equity, with in-processing methods offering better mitigation outcomes.

Abstract: As a basic human need, housing plays a key role in enhancing health,
well-being, and educational outcome in society, and the housing market is a
major factor for promoting quality of life and ensuring social equity. To
improve the housing conditions, there has been extensive research on building
Machine Learning (ML)-driven house price prediction solutions to accurately
forecast the future conditions, and help inform actions and policies in the
field. In spite of their success in developing high-accuracy models, there is a
gap in our understanding of the extent to which various ML-driven house price
prediction approaches show ethnic and/or racial bias, which in turn is
essential for the responsible use of ML, and ensuring that the ML-driven
solutions do not exacerbate inequity. To fill this gap, this paper develops
several ML models from a combination of structural and neighborhood-level
attributes, and conducts comprehensive assessments on the fairness of ML models
under various definitions of privileged groups. As a result, it finds that the
ML-driven house price prediction models show various levels of bias towards
protected attributes (i.e., race and ethnicity in this study). Then, it
investigates the performance of different bias mitigation solutions, and the
experimental results show their various levels of effectiveness on different
ML-driven methods. However, in general, the in-processing bias mitigation
approach tends to be more effective than the pre-processing one in this problem
domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/wahab1412/housing_fairness.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes transformers' performance for regression tasks with noisy input data on a manifold, showing their ability to leverage low-dimensional structures despite high-dimensional noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical foundation for transformers' performance in tasks with noisy data on manifolds, addressing a gap in understanding.

Method: Theoretical analysis of transformers for regression tasks, focusing on noisy input data in a tubular neighborhood of a manifold. Approximation and generalization errors are derived, depending on the manifold's intrinsic dimension.

Result: Transformers can effectively utilize low-dimensional structures in learning tasks, even with high-dimensional noise. A novel proof technique constructs representations of basic arithmetic operations.

Conclusion: Transformers are theoretically validated to handle noisy, low-dimensional data structures, with implications for their use in real-world applications.

Abstract: Transformers serve as the foundational architecture for large language and
video generation models, such as GPT, BERT, SORA and their successors.
Empirical studies have demonstrated that real-world data and learning tasks
exhibit low-dimensional structures, along with some noise or measurement error.
The performance of transformers tends to depend on the intrinsic dimension of
the data/tasks, though theoretical understandings remain largely unexplored for
transformers. This work establishes a theoretical foundation by analyzing the
performance of transformers for regression tasks involving noisy input data on
a manifold. Specifically, the input data are in a tubular neighborhood of a
manifold, while the ground truth function depends on the projection of the
noisy data onto the manifold. We prove approximation and generalization errors
which crucially depend on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. Our results
demonstrate that transformers can leverage low-complexity structures in
learning task even when the input data are perturbed by high-dimensional noise.
Our novel proof technique constructs representations of basic arithmetic
operations by transformers, which may hold independent interest.

*Xuyang Chen, Keyu Yan, Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAC, a novel offline RL method, addresses distribution shift by evaluating OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function and modulating Q-function updates via an advantage function, achieving superior performance on D4RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from distribution shift, leading to inaccurate evaluation and overestimation of OOD actions. Existing conservative approaches hinder generalization by discouraging all OOD actions.

Method: ADAC systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function, defines an advantage function to modulate Q-function updates, and tests performance in a custom PointMaze environment and D4RL benchmark.

Result: ADAC outperforms existing methods on D4RL tasks, especially in challenging scenarios, by effectively identifying and selecting superior OOD actions.

Conclusion: ADAC provides a robust solution to distribution shift in offline RL, enabling precise evaluation of OOD actions and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies
from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution
where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often
suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and
substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address
this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately
discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to
generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose
Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that
systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function.
Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the
Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We
design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal
that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD
actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear
margins on the more challenging tasks.

*Sanggeon Yun, Ryozo Masukawa, Hyunwoo Oh, Nathaniel D. Bastian, Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, plug-in detection framework for adversarial examples in DNNs, leveraging internal layer-wise inconsistencies and requiring only benign data for calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and existing detection methods are inefficient or lack generalizability.

Method: Proposes Recovery Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT) based on the A Few Large Shifts Assumption to detect adversarial perturbations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with minimal computational overhead and no impact on clean accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework is efficient, generalizable, and effective for adversarial example detection without external models or adversarial data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial
examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect
predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to
adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex
architectures, heavy augmentations, or adversarial data, limiting their
efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection
framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target
model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is
grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial
perturbations typically induce large representation shifts in a small subset of
layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery
Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to expose internal disruptions
caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under
both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art
detection performance with negligible computational overhead and no compromise
to clean accuracy. The code is available here:

TL;DR: The paper proposes PPTNet, a model combining periodic pattern extraction with Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction, and a fuzzy inference method for congestion identification, validated on a new dataset (TF4CHE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic flow prediction and real-time congestion identification are crucial for intelligent transportation systems, especially in congested highway scenarios.

Method: PPTNet uses Fast Fourier Transform for multi-scale periodic pattern extraction, 2D Inception convolutions for feature extraction, and a Transformer decoder for temporal modeling. A Mamdani fuzzy inference module identifies congestion.

Result: PPTNet outperforms mainstream methods in prediction accuracy, and the congestion module effectively identifies real-time congestion.

Conclusion: The proposed method is superior and practical for real-world traffic scenarios, as demonstrated by experimental results.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic flow parameters and real time identification
of congestion states are essential for the efficient operation of intelligent
transportation systems. This paper proposes a Periodic Pattern Transformer
Network (PPTNet) for traffic flow prediction, integrating periodic pattern
extraction with the Transformer architecture, coupled with a fuzzy inference
method for real-time congestion identification. Firstly, a high-precision
traffic flow dataset (Traffic Flow Dataset for China's Congested Highways and
Expressways, TF4CHE) suitable for congested highway scenarios in China is
constructed based on drone aerial imagery data. Subsequently, the proposed
PPTNet employs Fast Fourier Transform to capture multi-scale periodic patterns
and utilizes two-dimensional Inception convolutions to efficiently extract
intra and inter periodic features. A Transformer decoder dynamically models
temporal dependencies, enabling accurate predictions of traffic density and
speed. Finally, congestion probabilities are calculated in real-time using the
predicted outcomes via a Mamdani fuzzy inference-based congestion
identification module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
PPTNet significantly outperforms mainstream traffic prediction methods in
prediction accuracy, and the congestion identification module effectively
identifies real-time road congestion states, verifying the superiority and
practicality of the proposed method in real-world traffic scenarios. Project

Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of SNNs compared to ANNs, focusing on discrete-time LIF-SNNs.

Method: Study discrete-time LIF-SNNs with static inputs/outputs, analyzing their function approximation and input space partitioning.

Result: Demonstrates LIF-SNNs realize piecewise constant functions and quantifies network size for approximation; highlights latency's importance.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundations for LIF-SNNs, contrasting them with ANNs, and supports findings with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in developing spiking neural
networks (SNNs) as a potential solution to the energy challenges posed by
conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, our theoretical
understanding of SNNs remains relatively limited compared to the ever-growing
body of literature on ANNs. In this paper, we study a discrete-time model of
SNNs based on leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, referred to as
discrete-time LIF-SNNs, a widely used framework that still lacks solid
theoretical foundations. We demonstrate that discrete-time LIF-SNNs with static
inputs and outputs realize piecewise constant functions defined on polyhedral
regions, and more importantly, we quantify the network size required to
approximate continuous functions. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
latency (number of time steps) and depth (number of layers) on the complexity
of the input space partitioning induced by discrete-time LIF-SNNs. Our analysis
highlights the importance of latency and contrasts these networks with ANNs
employing piecewise linear activation functions. Finally, we present numerical
experiments to support our theoretical findings.

*Ning Zhang, Henry Kenlay, Li Zhang, Mihai Cucuringu, Xiaowen Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing the stability of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) under graph topology perturbations, offering a probabilistic perspective by considering data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on GCNN stability are limited to worst-case perturbations, lacking a broader understanding of how data distribution affects model robustness.

Method: The authors propose a distribution-aware formulation to analyze GCNN stability, examining output perturbations across diverse input data rather than focusing solely on worst-case scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the framework, showing improved representation stability and resilience to adversarial attacks compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis for developing robust and trustworthy GCNNs.

Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools
for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across
diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability
of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph
structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and
deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we
study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a
novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that
focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation
characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This
way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on
the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and
perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing
baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on
downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the
proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data
distribution into stability analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework for adapting pre-trained models, categorizing methods by manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge fragmented research areas like model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt instruction by understanding their shared principle of manipulating model interfaces while keeping parameters frozen.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy for adaptation approaches based on four dimensions: manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment.

Result: The framework applies across data modalities and model architectures, revealing theoretical connections and practical distinctions among existing techniques.

Conclusion: Neural network reprogrammability is a fundamental paradigm for efficient model adaptation, with identified challenges and promising research directions.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Result: Theoretical guarantees and extensive experiments show the methods consistently outperform existing alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance clustering performance by identifying stable and informative features, with practical implementation available.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering
performance in high-dimensional data, where irrelevant features can obscure
meaningful structure. In this work, we introduce the Minkowski weighted
$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and
informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling.
We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting privacy in relational and network-structured data is critical, but applying DP-SGD directly is challenging due to high sensitivity and coupled sampling procedures.

Method: Proposes an adaptive gradient clipping scheme and extends privacy amplification to coupled sampling, resulting in a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data.

Result: Demonstrates strong utility-privacy trade-offs in experiments on text-attributed network-structured relational data.

Conclusion: The framework provides provable privacy guarantees for relational learning, addressing key challenges in sensitivity and sampling.

Abstract: Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in
sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is
paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for
quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for
private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational
learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate
in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;
and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially
coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy
amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework
for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a
rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping
scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.
We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of
coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These
contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with
provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over
text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong
utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach. Our code is available at

### [485] [Course Project Report: Comparing MCMC and Variational Inference for Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization on the MovieLens Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09928)
*Ruixuan Xu, Xiangxiang Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares MCMC and VI for approximating the posterior in PMF, showing VI converges faster but MCMC is more accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PMF lacks tractable posterior computation; Bayesian methods (MCMC and VI) are explored to address this.

Method: Uses MCMC and VI to approximate the posterior in PMF, evaluated on MovieLens dataset.

Result: VI converges faster, but MCMC provides more accurate posterior estimates.

Conclusion: Both methods have trade-offs; choice depends on the need for speed (VI) or accuracy (MCMC).

Abstract: This is a course project report with complete methodology, experiments,
references and mathematical derivations. Matrix factorization [1] is a widely
used technique in recommendation systems. Probabilistic Matrix Factorization
(PMF) [2] extends traditional matrix factorization by incorporating probability
distributions over latent factors, allowing for uncertainty quantification.
However, computing the posterior distribution is intractable due to the
high-dimensional integral. To address this, we employ two Bayesian inference
methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [3, 4] and Variational Inference (VI)
[5, 6] to approximate the posterior. We evaluate their performance on MovieLens
dataset [7] and compare their convergence speed, predictive accuracy, and
computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that VI offers
faster convergence, while MCMC provides more accurate posterior estimates.

*Xinyu Yang, Yuwei An, Hongyi Liu, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multiverse introduces a parallel generative model inspired by AR-LLMs, using a MapReduce paradigm for adaptive task decomposition, parallel execution, and lossless synthesis. It achieves performance on par with leading AR-LLMs with superior scaling and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the implicit parallelism in AR-LLMs and enable natively parallel generation for improved efficiency and performance.

Method: Multiverse employs a three-stage MapReduce paradigm (Map, Process, Reduce) and integrates co-design of data, algorithm, and system. It uses automated data creation (Multiverse Curator), Multiverse Attention for parallel reasoning, and Multiverse Engine for parallel inference.

Result: Multiverse-32B matches AR-LLM performance (AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%) with superior scaling (1.87% better) and up to 2x speedup.

Conclusion: Multiverse demonstrates the feasibility of parallel generation models, offering efficiency and performance gains, and is open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit
parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce
Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.
Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through
three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process
stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless
result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with
co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer
from frontier AR-LLMs. For data creation, we develop Multiverse Curator, an
automated LLM-assisted pipeline that transforms sequential reasoning chains
into structured training data, avoiding costly human annotations.
Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning
steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.
Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to support parallel inference.
It features a dedicated interpreter that dynamically switches between
sequential and parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a
3-hour fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only
open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of
the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits
superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same
context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gains,
achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the
entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, as well as
complete data curation prompts and detailed training and evaluation recipes.

*Weiying Zhao, Aleksei Unagaev, Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining spectral clustering and cLHS improves SOC sampling representativeness by ensuring coverage of minor environmental clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard cLHS may overlook minor but important environmental clusters in SOC monitoring, leading to less accurate predictions.

Method: Integrates spectral clustering to partition the study area into homogeneous zones, then applies cLHS within each zone for diverse sampling.

Result: Spectral-cLHS provides more uniform covariate coverage and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS.

Conclusion: The hybrid method enhances SOC prediction accuracy by improving training data balance for machine learning models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores activation probes for detecting high-stakes interactions in LLMs, showing robust generalization and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored need for monitoring high-stakes interactions in LLMs to prevent harm.

Method: Evaluated probe architectures on synthetic data, tested generalization on real-world data, and compared performance to LLM monitors.

Result: Probes generalized well, matched LLM monitor performance, and saved significant computational resources.

Conclusion: Probes are efficient for initial monitoring, enabling hierarchical systems, with released dataset and code for further research.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

*Jianhong Wang, Yang Li, Samuel Kaski, Jonathan Lawry*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a game-theoretic approach to solve the n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT) problem in open multi-agent systems, using Shapley values for credit assignment and proposing a novel RL algorithm called Shapley Machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for NAHT lack theoretical rigor and clear credit assignment. The paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging cooperative game theory.

Method: The authors model NAHT using cooperative game theory, extending the game and state spaces for dynamic scenarios. They derive Shapley values for credit assignment and propose a TD(λ)-like RL algorithm, Shapley Machine.

Result: The proposed Shapley Machine algorithm effectively solves NAHT, with experiments validating its performance and theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges cooperative game theory and RL, providing a rigorous and effective solution for NAHT.

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of high communication overhead and insufficient agent-level personalization in multi-agent systems motivate the need for a more efficient and scalable collaboration framework.

Method: PE-MA uses lightweight personalized adapters for agent-specific behavior and a shared adapter collaboratively optimized across neighboring agents, balancing global coordination with local adaptation.

Result: The framework achieves an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of O(1/(NK)^(1/2)), where N is the number of agents and K the local update steps.

Conclusion: PE-MA effectively addresses the challenges of multi-agent systems by enabling efficient, scalable, and personalized co-evolution.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaborative reasoning and solving complex tasks. However, the design of
collaborative learning algorithms in multi-agent systems faces several
challenges, including high communication overhead and insufficient agent-level
personalization. In this paper, we propose PE-MA (Parameter-Efficient
Multi-Agent Co-Evolution), a novel collaboration framework that supports
efficient, scalable, and personalized co-evolution in multi-agent systems. In
PE-MA, each agent maintains a lightweight personalized adapter to support
agent-specific behavior, while a shared adapter is collaboratively optimized
across neighboring agents. This design balances global coordination with local
adaptation under heterogeneous environments. We achieve an asymptotically
optimal convergence rate of O( 1/(NK)^(1/2) ), where N is the number of agents
and K the local update steps.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses robust cooperative multi-agent RL under stochastic and non-stochastic uncertainties, proposing a minimax framework and a solution in the Linear Quadratic setting using Mean-Field Type Games (MFTG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of learning policies for cooperative agents with distributed information under uncertainties, where traditional methods are intractable.

Method: Formulates the problem in a worst-case minimax framework, uses MFTG for solution guarantees, and proposes a Receding-horizon Gradient Descent Ascent RL algorithm.

Result: Establishes MFTG Nash equilibrium guarantees, proves non-asymptotic convergence, and demonstrates efficacy via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The approach provides a tractable solution for robust multi-agent RL, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of robust cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (RL) where a large number of cooperative agents with
distributed information aim to learn policies in the presence of
\emph{stochastic} and \emph{non-stochastic} uncertainties whose distributions
are respectively known and unknown. Focusing on policy optimization that
accounts for both types of uncertainties, we formulate the problem in a
worst-case (minimax) framework, which is is intractable in general. Thus, we
focus on the Linear Quadratic setting to derive benchmark solutions. First,
since no standard theory exists for this problem due to the distributed
information structure, we utilize the Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) paradigm to
establish guarantees on the solution quality in the sense of achieved Nash
equilibrium of the MFTG. This in turn allows us to compare the performance
against the corresponding original robust multi-agent control problem. Then, we
propose a Receding-horizon Gradient Descent Ascent RL algorithm to find the
MFTG Nash equilibrium and we prove a non-asymptotic rate of convergence.
Finally, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach relative to a baseline algorithm.

### [493] [Policy Optimization and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Mean-variance Team Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22779)
*Junkai Hu, Li Xia*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG) by proposing a sensitivity-based optimization approach and a multi-agent policy iteration algorithm, MV-MAPI, which converges to a stationary point. It also extends this to a reinforcement learning method, MV-MATRPO, for unknown environments, validated via energy management experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of non-additive variance metrics and non-stationarity in MV-TSGs make dynamic programming unsuitable, motivating a sensitivity-based optimization approach.

Method: The paper derives performance difference and derivative formulas, proves the existence of Nash policies, and introduces MV-MAPI with sequential updates. It extends this to MV-MATRPO for unknown environments.

Result: MV-MAPI converges to stationary points, with conditions for Nash equilibria and local optima. MV-MATRPO provides a performance lower bound per update.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address MV-TSG challenges, with practical validation in microgrid energy management.

Abstract: We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each
agent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions
independently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the
variance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second,
simultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment
for each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming
inapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of
sensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance
derivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization
information for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy
for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy
Iteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual
agent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the
MV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective
function. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive
specific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and
further, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with
unknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to
MV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named
Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We
derive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally,
numerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are
conducted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of planning systems on platforms prone to fraudulent information (e.g., fake reviews) poses risks like financial losses and poor user experiences, necessitating an evaluation of these risks.

Method: WandaPlan is introduced as an evaluation environment with real-world data and deceptive content, tested across three fraud cases: Misinformation Fraud, Team-Coordinated Multi-Person Fraud, and Level-Escalating Multi-Round Fraud.

Result: Existing frameworks prioritizing task efficiency over data authenticity show significant weaknesses. WandaPlan proves generalizable for assessing risks in real-world open-source planning frameworks.

Conclusion: To mitigate fraud risks, the paper proposes integrating an anti-fraud agent, offering a reliable solution for planning systems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Planning has leveraged
advanced frameworks to enable autonomous and collaborative task execution. Some
systems rely on platforms like review sites and social media, which are prone
to fraudulent information, such as fake reviews or misleading descriptions.
This reliance poses risks, potentially causing financial losses and harming

performance across three fraud cases: Misinformation Fraud, Team-Coordinated
Multi-Person Fraud, and Level-Escalating Multi-Round Fraud. We reveal
significant weaknesses in existing frameworks that prioritize task efficiency
over data authenticity. At the same time, we validate WandaPlan's
generalizability, capable of assessing the risks of real-world open-source
planning frameworks. To mitigate the risk of fraud, we propose integrating an
anti-fraud agent, providing a solution for reliable planning.

*Jiajun He, Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces PMF-CEC, a phoneme-augmented multimodal fusion method, to improve ASR postprocessing by better correcting rare words and homophones, while addressing overdetection with a retention probability mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR models struggle with rare words, especially homophones. The goal is to enhance accuracy for such cases beyond the existing ED-CEC method.

Method: Proposes PMF-CEC, combining phoneme augmentation and multimodal fusion, and introduces a retention probability mechanism to reduce overdetection.

Result: PMF-CEC outperforms ED-CEC and other contextual biasing methods, reducing biased word error rates and handling homophones better, with faster inference than LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: PMF-CEC is effective for rare word correction, especially homophones, offering faster inference and robustness compared to alternatives.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced distribution, and speaker heterogeneity in privacy-preserving FL for dysarthric and elderly speech recognition.

Method: Systematic investigation of FL techniques: parameter-based, embedding-based, and novel loss-based regularization.

Result: Regularized FL outperforms FedAvg by up to 0.55% absolute WER reduction; increased communication frequency nears centralized performance.

Conclusion: Regularized FL is effective for improving speech recognition in dysarthric and elderly populations while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of speech features from OpenSMILE and Praat for adolescents with autism, highlighting tool-induced variations and biases in machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about reproducibility and fairness in behavioral models due to unvalidated speech processing tools, especially for diverse populations like adolescents with autism.

Method: Comparison of speech features extracted from OpenSMILE and Praat, assessing their reliability and impact on model performance across contexts and demographics.

Result: Significant variation in features across tools, affecting model performance and fairness.

Conclusion: Domain-relevant verification is needed to improve reliability and fairness of machine learning models in clinical settings.

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in improving Voice Type Classification for child-worn device recordings, finding marginal gains from technical improvements but more progress from better data relevance and sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address obstacles in transforming large-scale child speech data into usable information for speech sciences.

Method: Summarizes three years of experiments on Voice Type Classification, testing representation features, architecture, and parameter search.

Result: Technical improvements yield marginal gains; data relevance and quantity are more impactful.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of collecting and sharing high-quality, relevant data for meaningful progress.

Abstract: Recordings gathered with child-worn devices promised to revolutionize both
fundamental and applied speech sciences by allowing the effortless capture of
children's naturalistic speech environment and language production. This
promise hinges on speech technologies that can transform the sheer mounds of
data thus collected into usable information. This paper demonstrates several
obstacles blocking progress by summarizing three years' worth of experiments
aimed at improving one fundamental task: Voice Type Classification. Our
experiments suggest that improvements in representation features, architecture,
and parameter search contribute to only marginal gains in performance. More
progress is made by focusing on data relevance and quantity, which highlights
the importance of collecting data with appropriate permissions to allow
sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture children's language input and production with minimal bias, leveraging automated analysis due to data volume.

Method: Summarizes collective knowledge, identifies error sources in automated annotations, and proposes troubleshooting metrics.

Result: Highlights challenges in automated analysis and suggests practical strategies for improving data quality.

Conclusion: While fully automated quality control isn't feasible, practical strategies can enhance data collection and analysis.

Abstract: Audio-recordings collected with a child-worn device are a fundamental tool in
child language research. Long-form recordings collected over whole days promise
to capture children's input and production with minimal observer bias, and
therefore high validity. The sheer volume of resulting data necessitates
automated analysis to extract relevant metrics for researchers and clinicians.
This paper summarizes collective knowledge on this technique, providing entry
points to existing resources. We also highlight various sources of error that
threaten the accuracy of automated annotations and the interpretation of
resulting metrics. To address this, we propose potential troubleshooting
metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality
control system is not feasible, we outline practical strategies for researchers
to improve data collection and contextualize their analyses.

TL;DR: A multimodal approach using Whisper and LLMs improves child speech recognition and reading mistake detection, achieving a 5.1% WER and 0.73 F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support teachers by automating reading aloud evaluation, addressing limited research in this area.

Method: Combines Whisper and instruction-tuned LLMs with prompts for better transcription and mistake detection.

Result: Improved WER from 9.4% to 5.1% and F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73.

Conclusion: Prompting Whisper and LLMs enhances child speech recognition and reading evaluation.

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers
by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on
reading evaluation systems and applications remains limited. We present a novel
multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child
speech recognition, as well as their effectiveness in downstream reading
mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without
prompting. The best performing system achieved state-of-the-art recognition
performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER) of 5.1%,
improving the baseline WER of 9.4%. Furthermore, it significantly improved
reading mistake detection, increasing the F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates five TTS models for intelligibility and quality with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs, finding significant gaps compared to human expert renditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited evaluation of TTS models with MX inputs prompted this study to assess quality and intelligibility.

Method: Experiments included listening and transcribing tests, using LLMs for pronunciation from LaTeX MX, and metrics like Mean Opinion Score and transcription correctness.

Result: TTS models' outputs for MX were often unintelligible, with performance varying by model and MX category, and generally worse than expert renditions. LLM choice had minimal impact.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improving TTS models to better handle MX inputs.

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A unified multi-ASR prompt-driven framework using LLMs improves transcription accuracy and semi-supervised ASR performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pseudo-label generation for ASR involves complex pipelines with error propagation and disjoint optimization.

Method: Proposes a unified multi-ASR framework with LLM postprocessing (textual or speech-based) to replace voting/arbitration logic.

Result: Significant improvements in transcription accuracy and better performance in semi-supervised ASR training.

Conclusion: LLM-enhanced pseudo-labeling outperforms traditional methods, offering a more efficient and accurate approach for ASR training.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces LibriJump, a dataset for tracking intermittent and moving sources, and proposes adapted tracking association metrics to evaluate identity assignment performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tracking methods struggle with discontinuous spatial tracks caused by inactive sources changing positions, a rarely explored issue.

Method: The paper presents LibriJump, a dataset simulating discontinuous tracks, and adapts computer vision tracking association metrics for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show the complementarity of association metrics with existing tracking metrics for both continuous and discontinuous tracks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses gaps in tracking intermittent sources and provides a robust evaluation framework.

Abstract: This paper presents the problem of tracking intermittent and moving sources,
i.e, sources that may change position when they are inactive. This issue is
seldom explored, and most current tracking methods rely on spatial observations
for track identity management. They are either based on a previous localization
step, or designed to perform joint localization and tracking by predicting
ordered position estimates. This raises concerns about whether such methods can
maintain reliable track identity assignment performance when dealing with
discontinuous spatial tracks, which may be caused by a change of direction
during silence. We introduce LibriJump, a novel dataset of acoustic scenes in
the First Order Ambisonics format focusing on speaker tracking. The dataset
contains speakers with changing positions during inactivity periods, thus
simulating discontinuous tracks. To measure the identity assignment
performance, we propose to use tracking association metrics adapted from the
computer vision community. We provide experiments showing the complementarity
of association metrics with previously used tracking metrics, given continuous
and discontinuous spatial tracks.

Result: The method significantly outperforms simple microphone signal mixing, improving speech quality and noise reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances in-car speech quality, making it viable for real-world applications.

Abstract: With advancements in automotive electronics and sensors, the sound pick-up
using multiple microphones has become feasible for hands-free telephony and
voice command in-car applications. However, challenges remain in effectively
processing multiple microphone signals due to bandwidth or processing
limitations. This work explores the use of the Multichannel Wiener Filter
algorithm with a two-microphone in-car system, to enhance speech quality for
driver and passenger voice, i.e., to mitigate notch-filtering effects caused by
echoes and improve background noise reduction. We evaluate its performance
under various noise conditions using modern objective metrics like Deep Noise
Suppression Mean Opinion Score. The effect of head movements of
driver/passenger is also investigated. The proposed method is shown to provide
significant improvements over a simple mixing of microphone signals.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: S2ST-Omni is a framework for multilingual speech-to-speech translation, combining speech-to-text and text-to-speech in a single model, leveraging pretrained models to reduce reliance on parallel corpora and achieve high-quality, low-latency results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multilingual speech-to-speech translation, such as high-quality, low-latency requirements and reliance on large parallel speech corpora.

Method: Decomposes S2ST into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), using pretrained models (Whisper, Qwen 3.0) and a speech adapter for alignment. A streaming speech decoder ensures real-time performance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the CVSS benchmark with comparable latency.

Conclusion: S2ST-Omni is effective and practical for real-world deployment in multilingual speech-to-speech translation.

Abstract: Multilingual speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to directly convert
spoken utterances from multiple source languages into natural and intelligible
speech in a target language. Despite recent progress, significant challenges
remain: (1) achieving high-quality and low-latency S2ST remains a critical
hurdle; (2) existing S2ST approaches heavily rely on large-scale parallel
speech corpora, which are extremely difficult to collect. To address these
issues, we propose S2ST-Omni, an efficient and scalable framework for
multilingual speech-to-speech translation. Specifically, we decompose the S2ST
task into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS),
unifying them within a single end-to-end speech-language model. To achieve
high-quality S2TT while reducing dependence on parallel corpora, we leverage
large-scale pretrained models -- Whisper for audio understanding and Qwen 3.0
for text understanding. A lightweight speech adapter is introduced to align
speech and text representations, enabling effective use of pretrained
multimodal knowledge. To ensure both translation quality and real-time
performance, we adopt a pretrained streaming speech decoder in the TTS stage to
generate target speech in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on
the CVSS benchmark demonstrate that S2ST-Omni outperforms state-of-the-art S2ST
baselines while maintaining comparable latency, highlighting its effectiveness
and practical potential for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient speech enhancement method using pre-trained audio embeddings, outperforming existing models in quality and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve speech enhancement by leveraging pre-trained audio embeddings instead of traditional methods like time-frequency masking.

Method: Extracts audio embeddings from noisy speech, denoises them with a compact encoder, and synthesizes clean speech using a vocoder.

Result: Outperforms discriminative audioencoder-based models in enhancement and speaker fidelity, with better perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed generative audioencoder-based SE system is efficient and superior to state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Recent research has delved into speech enhancement (SE) approaches that
leverage audio embeddings from pre-trained models, diverging from
time-frequency masking or signal prediction techniques. This paper introduces
an efficient and extensible SE method. Our approach involves initially
extracting audio embeddings from noisy speech using a pre-trained audioencoder,
which are then denoised by a compact encoder network. Subsequently, a vocoder
synthesizes the clean speech from denoised embeddings. An ablation study
substantiates the parameter efficiency of the denoise encoder with a
pre-trained audioencoder and vocoder. Experimental results on both speech
enhancement and speaker fidelity demonstrate that our generative
audioencoder-based SE system outperforms models utilizing discriminative
audioencoders. Furthermore, subjective listening tests validate that our
proposed system surpasses an existing state-of-the-art SE model in terms of
perceptual quality.

*Wen Huang, Xuechen Liu, Xin Wang, Junichi Yamagishi, Yanmin Qian*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores sharpness as a theoretical proxy for generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD), showing its correlation with model performance and proposing Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in SDD lacks a theoretical framework, and performance metrics alone are insufficient to explain model behavior.

Method: Analyzes sharpness under domain shifts, applies SAM to reduce sharpness, and conducts correlation analysis between sharpness and generalization.

Result: Sharpness increases in unseen conditions, and SAM improves performance and stability across diverse test sets. A significant correlation between sharpness and generalization is confirmed.

Conclusion: Sharpness is a viable theoretical indicator for generalization in SDD, and sharpness-aware training enhances robustness.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge in speech deepfake detection
(SDD). While various approaches aim to improve robustness, generalization is
typically assessed through performance metrics like equal error rate without a
theoretical framework to explain model performance. This work investigates
sharpness as a theoretical proxy for generalization in SDD. We analyze how
sharpness responds to domain shifts and find it increases in unseen conditions,
indicating higher model sensitivity. Based on this, we apply Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) to reduce sharpness explicitly, leading to better and more
stable performance across diverse unseen test sets. Furthermore, correlation
analysis confirms a statistically significant relationship between sharpness
and generalization in most test settings. These findings suggest that sharpness
can serve as a theoretical indicator for generalization in SDD and that
sharpness-aware training offers a promising strategy for improving robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address cross-array generalization challenges in multi-channel ASR by decoupling signal processing from array geometry.

Method: Uses SHT for spatial sound field decomposition, SSAFN for spatial-spectral fusion, and Rand-SHT training for robustness.

Result: Achieves 39.26% average CER across heterogeneous arrays with 97.1% fewer computations than neural beamformers.

Conclusion: SHTNet effectively generalizes across array geometries while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents SHTNet, a lightweight spherical harmonic transform (SHT)
based framework, which is designed to address cross-array generalization
challenges in multi-channel automatic speech recognition (ASR) through three
key innovations. First, SHT based spatial sound field decomposition converts
microphone signals into geometry-invariant spherical harmonic coefficients,
isolating signal processing from array geometry. Second, the Spatio-Spectral
Attention Fusion Network (SSAFN) combines coordinate-aware spatial modeling,
refined self-attention channel combinator, and spectral noise suppression
without conventional beamforming. Third, Rand-SHT training enhances robustness
through random channel selection and array geometry reconstruction. The system
achieves 39.26\% average CER across heterogeneous arrays (e.g., circular,
square, and binaural) on datasets including Aishell-4, Alimeeting, and XMOS,
with 97.1\% fewer computations than conventional neural beamformers.

*Kathleen MacWilliam, Thomas Dietzen, Toon van Waterschoot*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper extends a method for estimating early room impulse responses (RIRs) along linear trajectories to more realistic scenarios by segmenting longer paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring RIRs at multiple points is time-consuming, and simulations need detailed room knowledge. The prior method was limited to small areas.

Method: Segment longer trajectories into smaller linear intervals where assumptions hold, applying the method piecewise.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness using the trajectoRIR database with real-world L-shaped trajectory data.

Conclusion: The extended method is practical for more complex room environments.

Abstract: Measuring room impulse responses (RIRs) at multiple spatial points is a
time-consuming task, while simulations require detailed knowledge of the room's
acoustic environment. In prior work, we proposed a method for estimating the
early part of RIRs along a linear trajectory in a time-varying acoustic
scenario involving a static sound source and a microphone moving at constant
velocity. This approach relies on measured RIRs at the start and end points of
the trajectory and assumes that the time intervals occupied by the direct sound
and individual reflections along the trajectory are non-overlapping. The
method's applicability is therefore restricted to relatively small areas within
a room, and its performance has yet to be validated with real-world data. In
this paper, we propose a practical extension of the method to more realistic
scenarios by segmenting longer trajectories into smaller linear intervals where
the assumptions approximately hold. Applying the method piecewise along these
segments extends its applicability to more complex room environments. We
demonstrate its effectiveness using the trajectoRIR database, which includes
moving microphone recordings and RIR measurements at discrete points along a
controlled L-shaped trajectory in a real room.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Diffusion models, trained on clean speech, assess speech quality by estimating likelihood in a Gaussian distribution, showing strong correlation with human scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore diffusion models for speech quality assessment without relying on annotations.

Method: Use an unconditional diffusion model trained on clean speech to estimate likelihood in a terminating Gaussian distribution via deterministic noising.

Result: Proposed log-likelihoods correlate well with intrusive metrics and human scores.

Conclusion: Diffusion models effectively assess speech quality unsupervised, leveraging clean speech priors.

Abstract: Diffusion models have found great success in generating high quality, natural
samples of speech, but their potential for density estimation for speech has so
far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we leverage an unconditional
diffusion model trained only on clean speech for the assessment of speech
quality. We show that the quality of a speech utterance can be assessed by
estimating the likelihood of a corresponding sample in the terminating Gaussian
distribution, obtained via a deterministic noising process. The resulting
method is purely unsupervised, trained only on clean speech, and therefore does
not rely on annotations. Our diffusion-based approach leverages clean speech
priors to assess quality based on how the input relates to the learned
distribution of clean data. Our proposed log-likelihoods show promising
results, correlating well with intrusive speech quality metrics and showing the
best correlation with human scores in a listening experiment.

Motivation: Enabling speech-aware LMs to produce efficient and effective speech output remains a challenge.

Method: Extends Phi-4 MM with an audio transformer head for delayed audio token prediction and a streaming vocoder for synthesis.

Result: Superior performance on CVSS-C dataset; matches SOTA with scaled training and model size.

Conclusion: Phi-Omni-ST advances speech-to-speech translation, demonstrating scalability and performance.

Abstract: Speech-aware language models (LMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
understanding spoken language while generating text-based responses. However,
enabling them to produce speech output efficiently and effectively remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present Phi-Omni-ST, a multimodal LM for direct
speech-to-speech translation (ST), built on the open-source Phi-4 MM model.
Phi-Omni-ST extends its predecessor by generating translated speech using an
audio transformer head that predicts audio tokens with a delay relative to text
tokens, followed by a streaming vocoder for waveform synthesis. Our
experimental results on the CVSS-C dataset demonstrate Phi-Omni-ST's superior
performance, significantly surpassing existing baseline models trained on the
same dataset. Furthermore, when we scale up the training data and the model
size, Phi-Omni-ST reaches on-par performance with the current SOTA model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve joint speech-text decoding paradigms for better performance, efficiency, and alignment in spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Systematic comparison of interleaved and parallel generation paradigms using the same base model, tokenizer, and data. Introduction of ESI to address slow inference.

Result: Interleaved approach achieves best alignment but is slow; ESI accelerates decoding and improves performance. QA datasets enhance speech QA.

Conclusion: ESI is a promising solution for efficient and high-quality joint speech-text decoding, with curated QA datasets further boosting performance.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

TL;DR: A modified MaskedAutoencoder (DDE-MAE) is proposed for respiratory sound classification, using dual encoders to disentangle disease-related and irrelevant features, improving performance on the ICBHI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in respiratory sound classification include data scarcity and domain mismatch from varied stethoscopes, demographics, and environments.

Method: Proposed DDE-MAE with two independent encoders to separate disease-related and irrelevant features, reducing domain mismatch.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on the ICBHI dataset.

Conclusion: DDE-MAE effectively addresses domain mismatch and improves classification accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to audio spectrograms for respiratory
sound classification, but it remains challenging to achieve satisfactory
performance due to the scarcity of available data. Moreover, domain mismatch
may be introduced into the trained models as a result of the respiratory sound
samples being collected from various electronic stethoscopes, patient
demographics, and recording environments. To tackle this issue, we proposed a
modified MaskedAutoencoder(MAE) model, named Disentangling Dual-Encoder MAE
(DDE-MAE) for respiratory sound classification. Two independent encoders were
designed to capture disease-related and disease-irrelevant information
separately, achieving feature disentanglement to reduce the domain mismatch.
Our method achieves a competitive performance on the ICBHI dataset.

### [517] [Grids Often Outperform Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11139)
*Namhoon Kim, Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) against grid-based methods, finding grids often outperform INRs in speed and quality, except for signals with lower-dimensional structure like shape contours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental capacity, biases, and scaling behavior of INRs compared to grid-based representations.

Method: Evaluated diverse INRs on 2D/3D signals (real and synthetic) with varying bandwidth, covering tasks like tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. Performance was stratified by model size, signal type, and bandwidth.

Result: Regularized grids with interpolation generally train faster and achieve higher quality than INRs with the same parameter count. INRs excel only in fitting signals with lower-dimensional structure (e.g., shape contours).

Conclusion: Grids are preferable for most tasks, but INRs are advantageous for signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure, guiding future INR applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as

### [518] [ADAgent: LLM Agent for Alzheimer's Disease Analysis with Collaborative Coordinator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11150)
*Wenlong Hou, Gangqian Yang, Ye Du, Yeung Lau, Lihao Liu, Junjun He, Ling Long, Shujun Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ADAgent, an AI agent for Alzheimer's disease analysis, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by integrating multi-modal data and advanced tools for improved diagnosis and prognosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and precise AD diagnosis is critical, but existing methods lack flexibility with multi-modal data and diverse tasks.

Method: ADAgent uses a large language model (LLM) with a reasoning engine, medical tools, and a coordinator for multi-modal AD tasks.

Result: ADAgent achieves significant accuracy improvements: 2.7% in multi-modal diagnosis, 0.7% in prognosis, and better MRI/PET diagnosis.

Conclusion: ADAgent is a promising tool for AD analysis, offering flexibility and superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

*James Batten, Michiel Schaap, Matthew Sinclair, Ying Bai, Ben Glocker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VeTTA, a novel framework, uses Transformer-based autoencoders to learn vector representations of 3D vascular networks, reducing GPU memory usage and improving reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling tree-structured geometric data (e.g., 3D vascular networks) with high fidelity and low computational cost.

Method: Employs two Transformer-based autoencoders: Vessel Autoencoder for segment-level embeddings and Vessel Tree Autoencoder for topology encoding, ensuring valid tree reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms 3D convolutional models in reconstruction fidelity, topology preservation, and latent space interpolations on 2D synthetic and 3D coronary artery datasets.

Conclusion: VeTTA provides scalable, precise, and topologically consistent modeling for anatomical tree structures in medical imaging.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

### [520] [DiffPR: Diffusion-Based Phase Reconstruction via Frequency-Decoupled Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11183)
*Yi Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework, addresses oversmoothing in QPI by removing high-level skip connections and using a diffusion model for high-frequency detail recovery, outperforming U-Net baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversmoothing in deep learning for QPI leads to loss of fine diagnostic details due to spectral bias, exacerbated by high-level skip connections in U-Nets.

Method: DiffPR: Stage 1 uses an asymmetric U-Net without high-frequency skips to predict low-frequency phase maps. Stage 2 refines this with a diffusion model to recover high-frequency details.

Result: DiffPR improves PSNR by 1.1 dB and reduces MAE by 11%, delivering sharper features like membrane ridges and speckle patterns.

Conclusion: Removing high-level skips and using a diffusion model effectively mitigates spectral bias in phase-retrieval networks.

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

### [521] [Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11283)
*Joakim Andén, Justus Sagemüller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A transformer-based neural network improves cryo-EM image denoising by clustering, aligning, and denoising simultaneously, outperforming single-image DNNs by 45% in MSE at low SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNNs are limited in high-noise settings like cryo-EM, where class averaging methods leverage redundant projections.

Method: A transformer-based architecture clusters, aligns, and denoises cryo-EM images simultaneously.

Result: Reduces relative MSE by 45% compared to single-image DNNs at SNR 0.03.

Conclusion: The transformer-based approach effectively combines clustering, alignment, and denoising for superior cryo-EM image processing.

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

*Jiaqi Wu, Jiahong Ouyang, Farshad Moradi, Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi, Greg Zaharchuk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study compares diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for MRI-to-PET image translation in epilepsy imaging, finding SGM-KD as the best for pure MRI-to-PET synthesis, while all models improve with low-dose PET inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the suboptimal radiation dose in FDG PET for epilepsy patients by synthesizing PET images from MRI or ultralow-dose PET using generative AI methods.

Method: Evaluated three models (SGM-KD, SGM-VP, Transformer-Unet) for MRI-to-PET translation in 52 subjects, using standard and clinical metrics like metabolic asymmetry.

Result: SGM-KD performed best for pure MRI-to-PET synthesis. Including 1% low-dose PET improved all models significantly, making them interchangeable.

Conclusion: SGMs show promise for MRI-to-PET translation, and all models can accurately synthesize full-dose PET when combined with ultralow-dose PET.

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

*Darren Olufemi Dahunsi, Randy Palmar, Tyler Henry, Mohammad Rahim Sobhani, Negar Majidi, Joy Wang, Afshin Kashani Ilkhechi, Jeremy Brown, Roger Zemp*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HERCULES is a novel 3D imaging technique using TOBE arrays for expansive scanning, achieving high resolution and speed, validated through simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable imaging beyond the shadow of RCA arrays, allowing whole organ imaging and 3D visualization of tissue morphology through limited windows.

Method: Uses Hadamard-Encoded-Read-Out (HERO) for beamforming on a synthetic 2D aperture, transmitting plane/cylindrical wavefronts. Validated via simulations, custom TOBE arrays, and experiments.

Result: Achieved comparable resolution to existing RCA methods at hundreds of frames per second, demonstrated in phantom and xenograft mouse model imaging.

Conclusion: HERCULES with TOBE arrays enables advanced 3D imaging, validated for practical applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays, also known as
bias-switchable row-column arrays (RCAs), allow for imaging techniques
otherwise impossible for non-bias-switachable RCAs. Hadamard Encoded Row Column
Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES) is a novel imaging technique that
allows for expansive 3D scanning by transmitting plane or cylindrical
wavefronts and receiving using Hadamard-Encoded-Read-Out (HERO) to perform
beamforming on what is effectively a full 2D synthetic receive aperture. This
allows imaging beyond the shadow of the aperture of the RCA array, potentially
allows for whole organ imaging and 3D visualization of tissue morphology. It
additionally enables view large volumes through limited windows. In this work
we demonstrated with simulation that we are able to image at comparable
resolution to existing RCA imaging methods at hundreds of frames per second. We
validated these simulations by demonstrating an experimental implementation of
HERCULES using a custom fabricated TOBE array, custom biasing electronics, and
a research ultrasound system. Furthermore, we assess our imaging capabilities
by imaging a commercial phantom, and comparing our results to those taken with
traditional RCA imaging methods. Finally, we verified our ability to image real
tissue by imaging a xenograft mouse model.

### [524] [The Iris File Extension](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10009)
*Ryan Erik Landvater, Michael David Olp, Mustafa Yousif, Ulysses Balis*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Iris file extension, a binary container format designed for efficient real-time transfer and display of whole slide images in digital pathology, addressing the limitations of the DICOM standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of digital pathology highlights the need for a performance-oriented intermediary slide format, as existing standards like DICOM are not optimized for the unique requirements of digital pathology.

Method: The Iris file extension is designed with modern compression, dynamic structure, optional metadata, validation, corruption recovery, and slide annotations. It includes source code for (de)serialization and validation, with language support for C++, Python, and JavaScript.

Result: The Iris specification is openly provided under a Creative Commons license, along with encoder/decoder implementations and binary builds for easy integration.

Conclusion: Iris addresses the unmet need for a vendor-agnostic, performance-focused binary slide format in digital pathology, offering a modern alternative to DICOM.

Abstract: A modern digital pathology vendor-agnostic binary slide format specifically
targeting the unmet need of efficient real-time transfer and display has not
yet been established. The growing adoption of digital pathology only
intensifies the need for an intermediary digital slide format that emphasizes
performance for use between slide servers and image management software. The
DICOM standard is a well-established format widely used for the long-term
storage of both images and associated critical metadata. However, it was
inherently designed for radiology rather than digital pathology, a discipline
that imposes a unique set of performance requirements due to high-speed
multi-pyramidal rendering within whole slide viewer applications. Here we
introduce the Iris file extension, a binary container specification explicitly
designed for performance-oriented whole slide image viewer systems. The Iris
file extension specification is explicit and straightforward, adding modern
compression support, a dynamic structure with fully optional metadata features,
computationally trivial deep file validation, corruption recovery capabilities,
and slide annotations. In addition to the file specification document, we
provide source code to allow for (de)serialization and validation of a binary
stream against the standard. We also provide corresponding binary builds with
C++, Python, and JavaScript language support. Finally, we provide full encoder
and decoder implementation source code, as well as binary builds (part of the
separate Iris Codec Community module), with language bindings for C++ and
Python, allowing for easy integration with existing WSI solutions. We provide
the Iris File Extension specification openly to the community in the form of a
Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative 4.0 International license.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAD-Net, a deep learning model using frequency-domain analysis, improves coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality, and precise segmentation of coronary arteries from ICA is crucial for clinical decision-making.

Method: FAD-Net integrates a frequency-domain attention mechanism (MLSA) and a cascading diffusion strategy (LFDM) to enhance segmentation accuracy by leveraging high- and low-frequency components.

Result: FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717 in segmentation and strong performance in stenosis detection (TPR: 0.6140, PPV: 0.6398).

Conclusion: FAD-Net shows significant potential for improving CAD diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

*Chunlei Li, Yilei Shi, Haoxi Hu, Jingliang Hu, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Lichao Mou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes adapting Stable Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution, outperforming existing methods with high-quality results at reduced radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the trade-off between CT image quality and patient safety by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for super-resolution.

Method: Uses a degradation model to synthesize low-quality CT images, generates text descriptions via a vision-language model, and applies Stable Diffusion with a controlling strategy for super-resolution.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, enabling high-quality CT imaging with lower radiation doses.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of Stable Diffusion for medical imaging, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient and scalable CVSR method inspired by hyperspectral images, reducing computational complexity and improving temporal information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in SOTA CVSR models, such as slow inference, complex training, and reliance on auxiliary data, due to increasing video frame rates.

Method: Introduces a compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy and modular architecture for integration with existing VSR frameworks.

Result: Achieves performance comparable or superior to SOTA models while significantly reducing inference time.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical and efficient solution for advancing VSR technology, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

*Yifei Tang, Hongjie Jiang, Changhong Jing, Hieu Pham, Shuqiang Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis, enhancing generalizability by expanding brain region representations across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for brain networks are limited to a single dimension, restricting their broader application in neuroscience.

Method: The model includes an adapter module for multi-dimensional feature expansion and a fine-tuned foundation model using self-supervised learning on fMRI data. A transformer block extracts features and computes inter-region associations.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a promising approach for brain network analysis and disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

*Zuzanna Skorniewska, Bartlomiej W. Papiez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores using deep generative models for synthetic medical imaging, focusing on retinal fundus images. It evaluates domain-specific loss functions but finds conventional edge detection more effective for vascular structure sharpness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, data scarcity, and bias in medical imaging by generating synthetic data, ensuring morphological and clinical accuracy.

Method: Compare domain-specific deep activation-based loss functions with perceptual and edge-detection losses for synthetic retinal image generation.

Result: Domain-specific deep features don't improve image generation; edge detection enhances vascular structure sharpness.

Conclusion: Conventional edge detection is more effective than domain-specific deep features for generating clinically accurate synthetic retinal images.

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

Result: MS-DT effectively extracts precise kinematic and dynamic tissue features, aiding spine biomechanics monitoring and rehabilitation.

Conclusion: The MS-DT framework enhances patient-specific diagnosis and intervention planning through high-fidelity modeling and real-time visualization.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and

*Zhangkai Ni, Yang Zhang, Wenhan Yang, Hanli Wang, Shiqi Wang, Sam Kwong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSIU, a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding method for efficient image super-resolution, combining data-driven and model-driven approaches to balance performance and compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven SR methods increase model complexity with deeper networks or transformers, while model-driven methods offer compactness. The goal is to merge these strengths for efficient SR.

Method: SSIU unfolds an SR optimization function with structural similarity constraints, using Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and Efficient Sparse Attention Modules (ESAM) per iteration, plus a Mixture-of-Experts-based Feature Selector (MoE-FS).

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods with fewer parameters and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: SSIU effectively combines data-driven and model-driven advantages, achieving efficient and high-performance image super-resolution.

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

*Martina Paccini, Giuseppe Patanè*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper compares algorithmic (region-growing) and AI-driven (TotalSegmentator) skin segmentation methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin segmentation is vital for medical applications like diagnostics and treatment planning, but choosing the right method depends on data and requirements.

Method: The study evaluates a region-growing algorithm and the TotalSegmentator (deep learning) across different imaging modalities (MRI, CT) and anatomical regions.

Result: AI excels in automation and CT bed removal but struggles with MRI due to CT-based training. The graphics-based method performs better for MRI but adds noise and requires manual bed removal.

Conclusion: The choice between AI and algorithmic methods depends on the imaging modality and application needs, balancing automation and accuracy.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures is critical in medical image
analysis, aiding diagnostics and treatment planning. Skin segmentation plays a
key role in registering and visualising multimodal imaging data. 3D skin
segmentation enables applications in personalised medicine, surgical planning,
and remote monitoring, offering realistic patient models for treatment
simulation, procedural visualisation, and continuous condition tracking. This
paper analyses and compares algorithmic and AI-driven skin segmentation
approaches, emphasising key factors to consider when selecting a strategy based
on data availability and application requirements. We evaluate an iterative
region-growing algorithm and the TotalSegmentator, a deep learning-based
approach, across different imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Our tests
show that AI segmentation excels in automation but struggles with MRI due to
its CT-based training, while the graphics-based method performs better for MRIs
but introduces more noise. AI-driven segmentation also automates patient bed
removal in CT, whereas the graphics-based method requires manual intervention.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MindGrab is a highly efficient deep learning model for skull-stripping in brain images, outperforming classical methods and matching SynthStrip in accuracy while using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a parameter- and memory-efficient model for volumetric skull-stripping that works across multiple imaging modalities without requiring high-end hardware.

Method: Developed a fully-convolutional model with a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, trained on synthetic data. Evaluated on 606 multimodal brain scans.

Result: Achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9, outperforming ROBEX and BET, and matching SynthStrip with 95% fewer parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: MindGrab offers state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly lower resource demands, making it accessible on a wider range of hardware.

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli
(https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The crossMoDA challenge series focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation for clinical applications, evolving over years to enhance clinical relevance. Findings show improved performance with expanded datasets but highlight challenges like declining cochlea Dice scores due to added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 MRI scans for cost-effective VS management, addressing extreme domain shifts.

Method: Unsupervised cross-modality segmentation from contrast-enhanced T1 to T2 MRI, evolving from single-institutional data to multi-institutional and heterogeneous datasets.

Result: Expanding datasets reduced outliers, and increased heterogeneity improved segmentation performance. However, cochlea Dice scores declined in 2023 due to added complexity.

Conclusion: While progress is evident, clinically acceptable VS segmentation requires further improvement. Future benchmarks may need more challenging cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

*Juhyung Park, Dongwon Park, Sooyeon Ji, Hyeong-Geol Shin, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Coil2Coil (C2C) is a self-supervised method for denoising multi-coil MRI images, leveraging coil redundancy without clean ground truth, outperforming prior methods and matching supervised results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoiding the need for expensive clean ground truth images in MRI denoising by exploiting multi-coil data redundancy.

Method: Uses phased array coils to split and combine data, generating noise-corrupted training pairs, with techniques to decorrelate and match clean images.

Result: C2C outperforms prior self-supervised methods and matches supervised results in synthetic and real-world denoising.

Conclusion: C2C is a promising self-supervised alternative for MRI denoising, reducing dependency on clean ground truth while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based denoising methods have shown powerful results for
improving the signal-to-noise ratio of magnetic resonance (MR) images, mostly
by leveraging supervised learning with clean ground truth. However, acquiring
clean ground truth images is often expensive and time-consuming. Self
supervised methods have been widely investigated to mitigate the dependency on
clean images, but mostly rely on the suboptimal splitting of K-space
measurements of an image to yield input and target images for ensuring
statistical independence. In this study, we investigate an alternative
self-supervised training method for deep denoisers in multi-coil MRI, dubbed
Coil2Coil (C2C), that naturally split and combine the multi-coil data among
phased array coils, generating two noise-corrupted images for training. This
novel approach allows exploiting multi-coil redundancy, but the images are
statistically correlated and may not have the same clean image. To mitigate
these issues, we propose the methods to pproximately decorrelate the
statistical dependence of these images and match the underlying clean images,
thus enabling them to be used as the training pairs. For synthetic denoising
experiments, C2C yielded the best performance against prior self-supervised
methods, reporting outcome comparable even to supervised methods. For
real-world denoising cases, C2C yielded consistent performance as synthetic
cases, removing only noise structures.

### [536] [We Care Each Pixel: Calibrating on Medical Segmentation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05107)
*Wenhao Liang, Wei Zhang, Lin Yue, Miao Xu, Olaf Maennel, Weitong Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces pixel-wise Expected Calibration Error (pECE) and Signed Distance Calibration Loss (SDC) to improve segmentation model calibration, ensuring both spatial precision and confidence reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like Accuracy, DSC, IoU, and HD lack calibration quality assessment, which is crucial for clinical reliability.

Method: Proposes pECE for pixel-level calibration measurement, a morphological adaptation strategy for ground-truth masks, and SDC loss for aligning boundary geometry with calibration objectives.

Result: The method enhances segmentation performance and calibration quality, providing more trustworthy confidence estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses calibration limitations in medical image segmentation, improving reliability for clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for computer-aided diagnostics,
providing accurate delineation of anatomical structures and pathological
regions. While common metrics such as Accuracy, DSC, IoU, and HD primarily
quantify spatial agreement between predictions and ground-truth labels, they do
not assess the calibration quality of segmentation models, which is crucial for
clinical reliability. To address this limitation, we propose pixel-wise
Expected Calibration Error (pECE), a novel metric that explicitly measures
miscalibration at the pixel level, thereby ensuring both spatial precision and
confidence reliability. We further introduce a morphological adaptation
strategy that applies morphological operations to ground-truth masks before
computing calibration losses, particularly benefiting margin-based losses such
as Margin SVLS and NACL. Additionally, we present the Signed Distance
Calibration Loss (SDC), which aligns boundary geometry with calibration
objectives by penalizing discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth
signed distance functions (SDFs). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method not only enhances segmentation performance but also improves calibration
quality, yielding more trustworthy confidence estimates. Code is available at:

### [537] [seg2med: a bridge from artificial anatomy to multimodal medical images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09182)
*Zeyu Yang, Zhilin Chen, Yipeng Sun, Anika Strittmatter, Anish Raj, Ahmad Allababidi, Johann S. Rink, Frank G. Zöllner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: seg2med is a modular framework for high-fidelity, anatomy-driven multimodal medical image synthesis, integrating anatomical priors, a modality-specific simulator, and diffusion models for CT and MR image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for high-quality, cross-modality medical image synthesis by leveraging structured anatomical priors to enhance fidelity and alignment in generated images.

Method: The framework combines anatomical maps from real patient data, XCAT phantoms, and synthetic anatomies, uses PhysioSynth for modality-specific simulation, and trains 2-channel conditional denoising diffusion models for image generation.

Result: seg2med achieves high SSIM (0.94 for CT, 0.89 for MR) and FID (3.62 for CT), with strong anatomical fidelity (Dice scores >0.90 for 11 organs).

Conclusion: seg2med demonstrates robust performance in cross-modality synthesis, data augmentation, and anatomy-aware medical AI, with potential applications in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: We present seg2med, a modular framework for anatomy-driven multimodal medical
image synthesis. The system integrates three components to enable
high-fidelity, cross-modality generation of CT and MR images based on
structured anatomical priors. First, anatomical maps are independently derived
from three sources: real patient data, XCAT digital phantoms, and synthetic
anatomies created by combining organs from multiple patients. Second, we
introduce PhysioSynth, a modality-specific simulator that converts anatomical
masks into prior volumes using tissue-dependent parameters (e.g., HU, T1, T2,
proton density) and modality-specific signal models. It supports simulation of
CT and multiple MR sequences including GRE, SPACE, and VIBE. Third, the
synthesized anatomical priors are used to train 2-channel conditional denoising
diffusion models, which take the anatomical prior as structural condition
alongside the noisy image, enabling generation of high-quality, structurally
aligned images. The framework achieves SSIM of 0.94 for CT and 0.89 for MR
compared to real data, and FSIM of 0.78 for simulated CT. The generative
quality is further supported by a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.62 for
CT synthesis. In modality conversion, seg2med achieves SSIM of 0.91 for MR to
CT and 0.77 for CT to MR. Anatomical fidelity evaluation shows synthetic CT
achieves mean Dice scores above 0.90 for 11 key abdominal organs, and above
0.80 for 34 of 59 total organs. These results underscore seg2med's utility in
cross-modality synthesis, data augmentation, and anatomy-aware medical AI.

TL;DR: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming medical image analysis by leveraging large unlabeled datasets, reducing reliance on manual annotations, and adapting to clinical tasks with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how FMs are developed and applied in medical imaging (pathology, radiology, ophthalmology) and their impact on reducing annotation dependency.

Method: Review of over 150 studies, covering FM pipelines, architectures, self-supervised learning, and downstream adaptation strategies.

Result: FMs show promise in medical imaging by learning general-purpose features and adapting to specific tasks with limited supervision.

Conclusion: FMs are reshaping medical image analysis, but challenges remain, requiring further research to address open questions.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by
learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on
manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose
visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with
little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies
for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each
imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we
discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.
