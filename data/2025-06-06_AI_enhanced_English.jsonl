VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint.

In\nthis paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View\nText Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval\nperformance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and\npartial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose\nChinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates\nglobal visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP\napplies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as\nthe exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on\nsingle-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle\ndiverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP\noutperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also\nprovides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the\nsuperior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts.

To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

Meanwhile,\nrecent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm\ncould soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with\nnetworks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this\npaper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model,\nparticularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce\nGenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform\nlight manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly\ninsert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and\ngenerate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned\non only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling\nsingle-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results\nhighlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information\nabout lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such\nmodels, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without\nexplicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenLit uses Stable Video Diffusion to relight single images without explicit 3D reconstruction, achieving plausible results with minimal training on synthetic data.", "motivation": "Traditional inverse rendering for relighting is costly and complex; leveraging video diffusion models offers a simpler alternative.", "method": "GenLit distills graphics engine capabilities into a video-generation model, enabling direct light manipulation in images.", "result": "The model generalizes to real-world scenes, producing convincing shadows and relighting effects.", "conclusion": "Video foundation models can effectively perform relighting without explicit 3D reconstruction or ray tracing."}}
