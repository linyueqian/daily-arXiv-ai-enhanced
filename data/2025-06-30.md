### [1] [Efficient Multilingual ASR Finetuning via LoRA Language Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21555)
*Jiahong Li, Yiwen Shao, Jianheng Zhuo, Chenda Li, Liliang Tang, Dong Yu, Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a finetuning framework using LoRA language experts for multilingual ASR, improving recognition performance by 10-15% over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual ASR faces interference between languages, making it hard to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model capacity.

Method: Uses LoRA language experts based on Whisper, employing expert fusion or knowledge distillation for finetuning.

Result: Achieves 10% and 15% relative performance gains in language-aware and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances multilingual ASR performance by mitigating language interference.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

### [2] [Adapting Whisper for Parameter-efficient Code-Switching Speech Recognition via Soft Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21576)
*Hongli Yang, Yizhou Peng, Hao Huang, Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT) enhances code-switching ASR in low-resource settings, outperforming traditional methods while maintaining parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in low-resource multilingual ASR, such as rare languages and code-switching, without degrading performance on existing languages.

Method: Evaluate two strategies: full fine-tuning (FFT) and Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), and introduce SPT4ASR, a combination of SPT variants.

Result: Deep prompt tuning is most effective; SPT4ASR methods reduce errors in CS ASR while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: SPT and SPT4ASR improve CS ASR performance without compromising prior knowledge or efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

### [3] [VAT-KG: Knowledge-Intensive Multimodal Knowledge Graph Dataset for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21556)
*Hyeongcheol Park, MinHyuk Jang, Ha Dam Baek, Gyusam Chang, Jiyoung Seo, Jiwan Park, Hogun Park, Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAT-KG, a multimodal knowledge graph covering visual, audio, and text, addressing limitations of existing MMKGs by enabling broader knowledge coverage and richer modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGs are limited in scope, outdated, and lack support for newer modalities like video and audio, reducing their applicability.

Method: Proposes VAT-KG, a concept-centric MMKG with cross-modal alignment, constructed via stringent filtering and alignment steps, and introduces a multimodal RAG framework.

Result: VAT-KG effectively supports MLLMs in multimodal question answering, demonstrating its practical value.

Conclusion: VAT-KG advances multimodal knowledge representation and retrieval, enhancing MLLM performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

### [4] [Language-Aware Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Seamless Language Expansion in Multilingual ASR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21577)
*Hongli Yang, Sheng Li, Hao Huang, Ayiduosi Tuohan, Yizhou Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Entire SPT and LAPT for multilingual ASR, improving performance in language expansion tasks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like language interference and expanding to unseen languages in multilingual ASR without degrading performance.

Method: 1) Entire SPT applies soft prompts to encoder and decoder. 2) LAPT uses cross-lingual similarities for shared and language-specific features. 3) SPT-Whisper toolkit integrates SPT into Whisper for continual learning.

Result: Entire SPT and LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks.

Conclusion: The methods provide efficient solutions for dynamic multilingual ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

### [5] [Debunk and Infer: Multimodal Fake News Detection via Diffusion-Generated Evidence and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21557)
*Kaiying Yan, Moyang Liu, Yukun Liu, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao, Xuefei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIFND is a fake news detection framework combining debunking knowledge, conditional diffusion models, and multimodal large language models for improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of fake news spread by enhancing detection performance and interpretability.

Method: Integrates debunk diffusion for evidence generation and a chain-of-debunk strategy with multimodal large language models for reasoning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on FakeSV and FVC datasets, providing trustworthy decisions.

Conclusion: DIFND effectively combines generative and reasoning capabilities for superior fake news detection.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

TL;DR: ChildGuard1 is a specialized dataset for detecting child-targeted hate speech, addressing gaps in existing datasets by including age-specific annotations and nuanced contexts. It benchmarks LLMs and other methods for effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hate speech datasets lack age-specific annotations and fail to account for the unique emotional impact on children, necessitating a specialized dataset.

Method: Curated dataset (ChildGuard1) derived from existing corpora with child-specific annotations, benchmarking state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including LLMs.

Result: ChildGuard1 provides a robust foundation for detecting and contextualizing child-targeted hate speech, with publicly released data for further research.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of child-targeted hate speech online underscores
the urgent need for specialized datasets to address this critical issue.
Existing hate speech datasets lack agespecific annotations, fail to capture
nuanced contexts, and overlook the unique emotional impact on children. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ChildGuard1, a curated dataset derived from
existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. ChildGuard
captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.
We benchmark existing state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including
Large Language Models (LLMs), and assess their effectiveness in detecting and
contextualizing child-targeted hate speech. To foster further research in this
area, we publicly release ChildGuard, providing a robust foundation for

### [7] [Bench to the Future: A Pastcasting Benchmark for Forecasting Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21558)
*FutureSearch, :, Jack Wildman, Nikos I. Bosse, Daniel Hnyk, Peter Mühlbacher, Finn Hambly, Jon Evans, Dan Schwarz, Lawrence Phillips*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BTF is a 'pastcasting' benchmark for LLMs, using known-resolution questions and offline web data to simulate forecasting, showing comparable results to real forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of realistic, repeatable forecasting benchmarks for LLMs by creating a controlled environment with known outcomes.

Method: Develop BTF with hundreds of high-quality past questions and offline web corpora to simulate forecasting. Test agent and chain-of-thought approaches using LLMs like Claude 4.

Result: BTF produces results comparable to real forecasts and tracks forecasting progress over time.

Conclusion: BTF is a living benchmark for realistic LLM forecasting evaluation, with plans for continuous updates and community involvement.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

### [8] [IndexTTS2: A Breakthrough in Emotionally Expressive and Duration-Controlled Auto-Regressive Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21619)
*Siyi Zhou, Yiquan Zhou, Yi He, Xun Zhou, Jinchao Wang, Wei Deng, Jingchen Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IndexTTS2 introduces a novel method for precise duration control in autoregressive TTS models, supports two generation modes, disentangles emotion and speaker identity, and enhances emotional clarity using GPT latent representations and soft instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive TTS models struggle with precise duration control, limiting applications like video dubbing. IndexTTS2 aims to address this while improving emotional and speaker disentanglement.

Method: Proposes two generation modes for duration control, disentangles emotion and speaker identity, uses GPT latent representations for stability, and employs soft instructions via fine-tuned Qwen3 for emotion guidance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

Conclusion: IndexTTS2 advances autoregressive TTS by enabling precise duration control and independent emotion-speaker control, enhancing performance and usability.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

### [9] [GraphLAMA: Enabling Efficient Adaptation of Graph Language Models with Limited Annotations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21559)
*Junze Chen, Cheng Yang, Shujie Li, Zhiqiang Zhang, Yawen Li, Junping Du, Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphLAMA introduces a parameter adaptation stage for GLMs to improve accuracy and speed, outperforming ICL and instruction tuning with fewer labeled examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of in-context learning (ICL) and instruction tuning in graph language models (GLMs) by proposing a more efficient and effective adaptation method.

Method: Proposes GraphLAMA, using a GNN backbone to transform nodes into LLM token representations, with pre-training and few-shot adaptation stages.

Result: Achieves 4.91% absolute improvement in accuracy and 10x faster inference speed compared to ICL.

Conclusion: GraphLAMA offers a superior alternative to ICL and instruction tuning for GLMs, with better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models for speech-impaired individuals improves transcription quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech impairments challenge ASR systems due to limited training data and annotation difficulties for non-normative speech.

Method: Proposes a pipeline for selecting words and enriching a small speech-impaired dataset with semantic coherence.

Result: Shows promising improvements in transcription quality for a child with structural speech impairment.

Conclusion: The approach has potential to reduce communication barriers for those with atypical speech patterns.

Abstract: Speech impairments caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic
disorders pose significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with
non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of
collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we
propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

*Tzu-Quan Lin, Hsi-Chun Cheng, Hung-yi Lee, Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how self-supervised speech Transformers encode speaker information by identifying neurons correlated with speaker data, revealing their role in preserving speaker-related task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little research has investigated how self-supervised speech Transformers encode speaker information, despite their growing use in speaker-related applications.

Method: The study identifies neurons in feed-forward layers correlated with speaker information by analyzing k-means clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors.

Result: The analysis shows these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, and protecting these neurons during pruning preserves speaker-related task performance.

Conclusion: The identified neurons play a crucial role in encoding speaker information, highlighting their importance in self-supervised speech models.

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

*Yifu Han, Geo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates RL fine-tuning techniques (SFT, DPO, RLOO) on a compact language model for instruction following and math reasoning, finding RLOO with DeBERTa rewards optimal for alignment and DPO consistent. Synthetic data and best-of-N sampling boost math task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective RL fine-tuning methods for small language models in challenging tasks like instruction following and mathematical reasoning.

Method: Compared SFT, DPO, and RLOO with reward models (DeBERTa). Used synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external verifier for math tasks.

Result: RLOO with DeBERTa rewards achieved the best alignment; DPO was consistent. Synthetic data and best-of-N sampling improved math task accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools enhances lightweight model performance, highlighting practical strategies for task alignment.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

### [13] [Analyzing and Fine-Tuning Whisper Models for Multilingual Pilot Speech Transcription in the Cockpit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21990)
*Kartheek Kumar Reddy Nareddy, Sarah Ternus, Julia Niebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations using Whisper models by fine-tuning and normalization, reducing WER from 68.49% to 26.26%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models struggle with niche domains like cockpit speech due to specific vocabulary and multilingual content.

Method: Collected and labeled cockpit recordings, proposed normalization schemes, and fine-tuned Whisper models using LoRA.

Result: WER decreased significantly from 68.49% to 26.26% after fine-tuning and normalization.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning and normalization effectively improve ASR performance for niche domains like cockpit conversations.

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

### [14] [Reasoning Isn't Enough: Examining Truth-Bias and Sycophancy in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21561)
*Emilio Barkett, Olivia Long, Madhavendra Thakur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' truth-judgment capabilities, finding reasoning models less truth-biased than non-reasoning ones but still flawed, with sycophantic tendencies in advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' effectiveness as truth judges, given their use in critical applications like fact-checking and decision-making.

Method: Evaluated 8 LLMs on 4,800 veracity judgments, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models across prompts.

Result: Reasoning models showed lower truth-bias but still underperformed humans. Advanced models exhibited sycophantic tendencies, excelling in truth accuracy but failing in deception detection.

Conclusion: Capability improvements in LLMs don't inherently solve veracity detection challenges, highlighting persistent flaws.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

*Muhammad Umar Farooq, Oscar Saz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves speech recognition for dialectal Arabic and Arabic-English code-switched speech using a modified audio-splicing method and Experience Replay, achieving significant WER reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and improve performance on dialectal Arabic and Arabic-English code-switched speech tasks.

Method: Introduces a modified audio-splicing approach (SAGE) for artificial data generation and an Experience Replay technique to enhance generalization.

Result: Achieves absolute WER improvements (7.8% on CS benchmarks) and outperforms larger models (5.5-8.4% better than USM and Whisper-large-v2).

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address data scarcity and improve performance, surpassing larger models in code-switched speech recognition.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

*Jun Yin, Pengyu Zeng, Jing Zhong, Peilin Li, Miao Zhang, Ran Luo, Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'next room prediction' paradigm for floor plan generation, inspired by autoregressive models, to better align with real-world iterative design workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for floor plans are end-to-end and don't match the incremental nature of architectural design.

Method: Proposes a 'next room prediction' approach, inspired by autoregressive language models, for progressive floor plan generation.

Result: FPDS shows competitive performance against diffusion models and Tell2Design in text-to-floorplan tasks.

Conclusion: The method has potential for supporting intelligent architectural design by aligning with real-world iterative workflows.

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting

### [17] [FormosanBench: Benchmarking Low-Resource Austronesian Languages in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21563)
*Kaiying Kevin Lin, Hsiyu Chen, Haopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FORMOSANBENCH, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on low-resource Formosan languages, revealing significant performance gaps and limited improvements from existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capabilities of LLMs in low-resource and endangered languages, specifically Formosan languages, due to their linguistic richness and sociolinguistic challenges.

Method: FORMOSANBENCH evaluates LLMs on three Formosan languages (Atayal, Amis, Paiwan) across machine translation, ASR, and text summarization tasks, testing zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings.

Result: LLMs underperform significantly on Formosan languages, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning providing only marginal improvements.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for more inclusive NLP technologies to support endangered languages, with released datasets and code to aid future research.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

Motivation: To improve fact-checked claim retrieval performance.

Method: Three-stage framework: candidate retrieval, re-ranking with Top-10 results, and weighted voting for final outcomes.

Result: Achieved 5th in monolingual and 7th in crosslingual tracks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, with code released for public use.

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of QUST_NLP in the SemEval-2025 Task
7. We propose a three-stage retrieval framework specifically designed for
fact-checked claim retrieval. Initially, we evaluate the performance of several
retrieval models and select the one that yields the best results for candidate
retrieval. Next, we employ multiple re-ranking models to enhance the candidate
results, with each model selecting the Top-10 outcomes. In the final stage, we
utilize weighted voting to determine the final retrieval outcomes. Our approach
achieved 5th place in the monolingual track and 7th place in the crosslingual
track. We release our system code at:

### [19] [A Multi-Agent Probabilistic Inference Framework Inspired by Kairanban-Style CoT System with IdoBata Conversation for Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21565)
*Takato Ueno, Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent framework (KCS+IBC) inspired by Japan's kairanban and idobata conversations to improve sentiment analysis by mitigating bias, enhancing explainability, and enabling probabilistic prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage traditional Japanese communication practices for modern AI applications, addressing bias and improving explainability in sentiment analysis.

Method: Integrates multiple LLMs with a mid-phase casual dialogue session and probabilistic sentiment prediction.

Result: KCS matches single LLM accuracy, while KCS+IBC reduces entropy and increases variance, balancing prediction aggregation and diversity.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for bias correction and advanced sentiment analysis, with future work planned to quantify its impact.

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

### [20] [The Saturation Point of Backtranslation in High Quality Low Resource English Gujarati Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21566)
*Arwa Arif*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Backtranslation (BT) for English-Gujarati MT using MBART50 shows no improvement despite careful filtering, suggesting diminishing returns in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of backtranslation in high-quality, low-resource machine translation, specifically for English-Gujarati.

Method: Augmented a baseline system (trained on 50K parallel sentences) with filtered backtranslated data from monolingual Gujarati text.

Result: Adding synthetic data did not improve performance; slight degradation observed in some cases.

Conclusion: Backtranslation may have diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings, warranting further research.

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

### [21] [BioPars: A Pretrained Biomedical Large Language Model for Persian Biomedical Text Mining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21567)
*Baqer M. Merzah, Tania Taami, Salman Asoudeh, Amir reza Hossein pour, Saeed Mirzaee, Amir Ali Bengari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioPars, a framework for evaluating LLMs in bioinformatics, using datasets like BIOPARS-BENCH and BioParsQA. It highlights LLMs' strengths in knowledge retrieval but notes limitations in complex reasoning, showing BioPars outperforms models like GPT-4 in Persian medical QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance the capabilities of LLMs in bioinformatics, particularly for Persian medical question-answering, addressing gaps in complex reasoning and fine-grained inferences.

Method: Developed BIOPARS-BENCH and BioParsQA datasets, introduced BioPars to evaluate LLMs (ChatGPT, Llama, Galactica) on knowledge acquisition, synthesis, and evidence demonstration.

Result: BioPars outperformed GPT-4 and others, achieving ROUGE-L=29.99, BERTScore=90.87, MoverScore=60.43, and BLEURT=50.78 on Persian medical QA tasks.

Conclusion: BioPars demonstrates LLMs' potential in specialized domains but underscores the need for further fine-tuning to improve complex reasoning. The project is open-source for community contribution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

### [22] [Assessing RAG and HyDE on 1B vs. 4B-Parameter Gemma LLMs for Personal Assistants Integretion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21568)
*Andrejs Sorstkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates RAG and HyDE augmentation strategies on compact Gemma LLMs (1B and 4B parameters) for privacy-first personal assistants, finding RAG more efficient and reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource efficiency is critical for deploying LLMs in edge and privacy-sensitive applications, prompting the need to evaluate augmentation strategies.

Method: Implemented RAG and HyDE on Gemma LLMs (1B and 4B), using MongoDB for short-term memory, Qdrant for long-term storage, and FastAPI/LangChain for orchestration, with a React.js frontend.

Result: RAG reduced latency by up to 17% and eliminated hallucinations, while HyDE improved semantic relevance but increased response time (25-40%) and hallucination rates. Scaling to 4B models magnified HyDE's overhead.

Conclusion: RAG is the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants with small-scale LLMs due to its efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

*Weihua Xiao, Derek Ekberg, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and synthetic fine-tuning improves LLM performance in translating natural language to SystemVerilog Assertions (NL2SVA), achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual translation of natural language to SystemVerilog Assertions (NL2SVA) is labor-intensive and error-prone, necessitating automation using LLMs.

Method: Proposes a customized RAG framework and synthetic fine-tuning dataset with prompt-guided explanations to teach LLMs the construction of SVAs.

Result: The framework increases functionality-matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini and 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances LLM performance in NL2SVA, addressing domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

*Roland Riachi, Kashif Rasul, Arjun Ashok, Prateek Humane, Alexis Roger, Andrew R. Williams, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Irina Rish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the transfer of pre-trained language models (LMs) to time series forecasting, focusing on design choices like post-training, tokenizers, and model size, revealing their impact in low-data regimes and a persistent transfer gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-trained LMs can be effectively adapted for time series forecasting, especially in low-data scenarios, and to explore the impact of design choices on performance.

Method: Analyzes transfer effectiveness under various design choices, including upstream post-training, time series tokenizers, and language backbone size, comparing validation loss trends.

Result: Design choices significantly impact validation loss in low-data regimes, with clear optimal choices. A non-vanishing transfer gap persists, unlike prior findings.

Conclusion: The study highlights effective compute-efficient training for time series and opens avenues for studying modality-agnostic data properties leveraged by LMs.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

### [25] [Towards Understanding the Cognitive Habits of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21571)
*Jianshuo Dong, Yujia Fu, Chuanrui Hu, Chao Zhang, Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogTest, a benchmark to evaluate cognitive habits in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), revealing their human-like adaptability and patterns in reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits and understand their reasoning behaviors better.

Method: Introduces CogTest, a benchmark with 16 cognitive habits, each tested on 25 tasks, using an evidence-first extraction method. Evaluates 16 LLMs (13 LRMs, 3 non-reasoning).

Result: LRMs show human-like habits, adaptively deploy them, and exhibit inter-family similarities. Certain habits correlate with harmful responses.

Conclusion: Studying LRMs' cognitive habits provides insights into their behavior, aiding understanding of model misbehavior.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured, interpretable benchmark framework for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and a capability hierarchy based on Piaget's theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks lack structured, interpretable designs, leading to overlapping abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power.

Method: Proposes a framework using SEM to analyze benchmark validity and introduces a capability hierarchy (Perception, Memory, Reasoning) based on Piaget's theory. Reorganizes benchmarks and constructs a new one named Gold.

Result: The Gold benchmark shows improved interpretability, reduced redundancy, and clearer cognitive consistency compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark offer a more structured and theoretically grounded approach to evaluating MLLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

*Yanwei Ren, Liu Liu, Baosheng Yu, Jiayan Qiu, Quan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework combines black-box and white-box models to optimize LLM instructions, balancing cost, quality, and interpretability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of white-box (high resource use) and black-box (high cost) approaches in LLM instruction optimization.

Method: Merge black-box models for diverse initializations with white-box models for interpretability, using semantic similarity constraints for unified representation and iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in tasks like complex reasoning and cross-lingual generalization.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers a scalable, efficient solution for next-gen LLM applications, with source code to be released.

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for immigration decision-making, finding they align with human strategies but still exhibit biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing workload and fairness challenges in immigration departments through AI integration.

Method: Mixed-methods approach with discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews.

Result: LLMs align with human decision-making but show biases related to nationality and privilege.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for immigration automation but require addressing biases.

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

*Qihao Zhao, Yangyu Huang, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Qinzheng Sun, Shaoguang Mao, Xin Zhang, Ying Xin, Qiufeng Yin, Scarlett Li, Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMLU-CF, a contamination-free MCQ benchmark to evaluate LLMs more reliably by preventing data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCQ benchmarks suffer from contamination due to open-source data and LLM training, leading to unreliable evaluations.

Method: MMLU-CF avoids unintentional leakage by sourcing broader data and applying decontamination rules, and prevents malicious leakage by keeping the test set closed-source.

Result: GPT-4o scores 73.4% (5-shot) and 71.9% (0-shot) on MMLU-CF, showing its rigor.

Conclusion: MMLU-CF provides a more reliable and challenging benchmark for evaluating LLMs.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository
is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM is a unified framework for training LLMs to perform structured reasoning over relational and graph data, combining RL and CoT supervision. It introduces a topology-aware reward for graph parsing and achieves cross-formalism transfer between SQL and Cypher, leading to significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in training LLMs for structured reasoning across relational and graph data, leveraging shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher for cross-formalism transfer.

Method: Joint optimization of Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks using RL and CoT supervision, with a topology-aware reward function for graph parsing.

Result: Substantial improvements: 13.5% on Spider (semantic parsing), 73.1% on Text2Cypher. Strong zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks like TableBench (8.5%) and CR-LT-KGQA (1.7%).

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM effectively uses executable queries for structured reasoning and benefits from joint SQL and Cypher training, demonstrating cross-formalism transfer and strong generalization.

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

TL;DR: HealthQA-BR is a Portuguese-language benchmark for evaluating LLMs in healthcare, revealing uneven performance across specialties despite high overall scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations in healthcare are physician-centric and English-dominated, lacking realism for interprofessional care.

Method: Introduced HealthQA-BR, a 5,632-question benchmark from Brazilian exams, and evaluated 20+ LLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Result: GPT 4.1 scored 86.6% overall but showed drastic drops in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and Social Work (68.4%).

Conclusion: High-level scores are misleading; granular benchmarks like HealthQA-BR are essential for realistic AI safety validation in healthcare.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

### [32] [From General Reasoning to Domain Expertise: Uncovering the Limits of Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21580)
*Dana Alsagheer, Yang Lu, Abdulrahman Kamal, Omar Kamal, Mohammad Kamal, Nada Mansour, Cosmo Yang Wu, Rambiba Karanjai, Sen Li, Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the link between general reasoning in LLMs and their performance in domain-specific tasks, emphasizing reasoning as the foundation for decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how general reasoning capabilities in LLMs impact their effectiveness in specialized reasoning tasks, given their growing role in AI decision-making.

Method: Explores the relationship between general reasoning and domain-specific reasoning in LLMs, likely through empirical analysis or benchmarking.

Result: Findings likely reveal how general reasoning skills translate to specialized tasks, informing LLM training and application.

Conclusion: General reasoning in LLMs is crucial for domain-specific performance, suggesting targeted training can enhance their decision-making abilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

### [33] [Data Efficacy for Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21545)
*Yalun Dai, Yangyu Huang, Xin Zhang, Wenshan Wu, Chong Li, Wenhui Lu, Shijie Cao, Li Dong, Scarlett Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Efficacy (DELT), a paradigm optimizing training data organization for language models, with components like Data Scoring (LQS) and Data Ordering (FO), showing improved performance without extra data or model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored area of data efficacy in LM training, focusing on optimizing data organization rather than just selection or filtering.

Method: Proposes DELT, a framework with Data Scoring (LQS), Data Selection, and Data Ordering (FO). LQS scores data by learnability and quality, while FO addresses forgetting and bias.

Result: DELT improves LM performance without additional data or model size. LQS and FO combined yield the most significant gains. Data efficacy complements data efficiency.

Conclusion: Data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training, enhancing performance through optimized data organization.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

*Sam Yu-Te Lee, Chengyang Ji, Shicheng Wen, Lifu Huang, Dongyi Liu, Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VIDEE is a system designed to help entry-level analysts perform advanced text analytics using intelligent agents, leveraging LLMs and human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lowering the barrier for entry-level analysts to perform text analytics by automating and simplifying the process with LLMs.

Method: VIDEE uses a three-stage workflow: Decomposition (human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search), Execution (pipeline generation), and Evaluation (LLM-based validation and visualization).

Result: Quantitative experiments and a user study show VIDEE's effectiveness, usability for non-experts, and distinct user behavior patterns.

Conclusion: VIDEE validates the potential of human-agent collaboration in text analytics and provides insights for future system improvements.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

*Muhammad Ahmad, Muhammad Waqas, Ameer Hamza, Ildar Batyrshin, Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first annotated dataset for hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu, proposes a custom transformer model, and demonstrates its superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in NLP research for low-resource, informal language varieties like Roman Urdu by focusing on hope speech detection.

Method: Develops a multi-class annotated dataset, explores linguistic patterns, and proposes an attention-based transformer model (XLM-R) evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: XLM-R achieves a cross-validation score of 0.78, outperforming SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76).

Conclusion: The study successfully fills a critical gap in inclusive NLP research and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model for Roman Urdu hope speech detection.

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

### [36] [Empirical Evidence for Alignment Faking in Small LLMs and Prompt-Based Mitigation Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21584)
*J. Koorndijk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small instruction-tuned models like LLaMA 3 8B can exhibit alignment faking, which can be reduced via prompt-only interventions, challenging assumptions about scale and triviality of prompt-based ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is exclusive to large language models or can also occur in smaller models.

Method: Used LLaMA 3 8B, applied prompt-only interventions (deontological moral framing, scratchpad reasoning) to test suppression of alignment faking.

Result: Small models can show alignment faking, but prompt interventions significantly reduce it. Introduced taxonomy of shallow vs. deep deception.

Conclusion: Alignment evaluations should consider model size and deployment settings, as prompt-based ethics are non-trivial and deceptive alignment doesn't require scale.

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

*Christoph Brosch, Sian Brumm, Rolf Krieger, Jonas Scheffler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares direct and indirect LLM-based extraction methods for retrieving food product attributes from web pages, finding indirect methods more efficient and cost-effective despite slightly lower accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalable and cost-effective solutions for extracting structured information from food product web pages using LLMs.

Method: Two LLM-based approaches: direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluated on 3,000 food product pages for accuracy, efficiency, and cost.

Result: Indirect extraction achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48%) but reduces LLM calls by 95.82%, improving efficiency and lowering costs.

Conclusion: Indirect extraction is a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale information extraction from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

### [38] [Can Vision Language Models Understand Mimed Actions?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21586)
*Hyundong Cho, Spencer Lin, Tejas Srinivasan, Michael Saxon, Deuksin Kwon, Natali T. Chavez, Jonathan May*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIME is a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on mimed actions, showing they lag behind humans in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying nonverbal communication (NVC) is complex; mime offers a focused subset with lower interpretation variance, making it ideal for research.

Method: Proposed MIME, a video-based QA benchmark with 86 mimed actions, using motion capture data and perturbations for robustness testing.

Result: Vision-language models perform worse than humans on MIME, highlighting gaps in understanding human gestures.

Conclusion: MIME underscores the need for better models to interpret mimed actions, advancing NVC research.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates MLLMs on textbook QA using CK12-QA, introduces a RAG pipeline, and highlights limitations in handling complex educational content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' reasoning over complex educational lessons and diagrams, which are not tested as single images.

Method: Evaluates LLaVA and LLaMA 3.2-Vision on TQA, introduces a lightweight RAG pipeline integrating text and diagrams.

Result: Shows the impact of retrieved context on accuracy but reveals limitations in question-context relationships and noise handling.

Conclusion: Identifies key areas for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

### [40] [Is DeepSeek a New Voice Among LLMs in Public Opinion Simulation?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21587)
*Weihong Qi, Fan Huang, Jisun An, Haewoon Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other LLMs in simulating U.S. opinions on abortion and Chinese opinions on foreign aid, but shows biases and limitations in modeling diverse demographic views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare DeepSeek's ability to simulate public opinions with major LLMs and assess biases in cross-cultural contexts.

Method: Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 using ANES and Zuobiao datasets for U.S. and Chinese public opinion topics.

Result: DeepSeek-V3 excels in specific topics but struggles with demographic diversity and cultural biases, often overgeneralizing perspectives.

Conclusion: LLMs need inclusive training to reduce biases in public opinion modeling, especially across cultures and demographics.

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

Motivation: To assess and improve the performance of large language models in medically-oriented question answering, targeting the expertise level of General Practitioners.

Method: The task provides 4,978 expert-verified medical QA pairs in 7 formats. Systems are evaluated using Docker/Apptainer images on CodaBench or Zaratan, with automated scoring (Task 1) and physician audits (Task 2).

Result: Systems are scored by exact match for closed-ended questions and a three-tier embedding metric for open-ended ones, followed by physician review of top models.

Conclusion: ClinIQLink aims to rigorously evaluate LLMs in medical QA, combining automated and expert human assessment for comprehensive analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an overview of ClinIQLink, a shared task,
collocated with the 24th BioNLP workshop at ACL 2025, designed to stress-test
large language models (LLMs) on medically-oriented question answering aimed at
the level of a General Practitioner. The challenge supplies 4,978
expert-verified, medical source-grounded question-answer pairs that cover seven
formats: true/false, multiple choice, unordered list, short answer,
short-inverse, multi-hop, and multi-hop-inverse. Participating systems, bundled
in Docker or Apptainer images, are executed on the CodaBench platform or the
University of Maryland's Zaratan cluster. An automated harness (Task 1) scores
closed-ended items by exact match and open-ended items with a three-tier
embedding metric. A subsequent physician panel (Task 2) audits the top model
responses.

*Ilya Lasy, Peter Knees, Stefan Woltran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanisms of memorization in LLMs, identifying specific circuits responsible for initiating and maintaining memorization, and explores their context-dependence and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the exact mechanisms behind memorization in LLMs, including how and where memorization starts and how the model behaves differently when producing memorized vs. non-memorized content.

Method: Uses transformer circuits and contrastive datasets to isolate and analyze circuits responsible for memorization initiation and maintenance.

Result: Found that initiation circuits can also maintain memorization, while maintenance-only circuits cannot initiate it. Memorization prevention transfers across domains, but induction is context-dependent.

Conclusion: Memorization in LLMs involves distinct circuits with varying roles and context dependencies, offering insights for mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

*Minjia Mao, Dongjun Wei, Xiao Fang, Michael Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general LLM detector (GLD) to identify LLM-generated content across unseen models and domains, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of distinguishing human-written from LLM-generated content is critical for trust and misinformation prevention on digital platforms.

Method: GLD uses twin memory networks and a theory-guided detection generalization module for broader applicability.

Result: Empirical evaluations show GLD outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods.

Conclusion: GLD offers significant academic and practical benefits for digital platforms and LLM applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

*Chang Liu, Hongkai Chen, Yujun Cai, Hang Wu, Qingwen Ye, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how input format affects document comprehension in MLLMs, finding raw OCR text harms performance. A structure-preserving LaTex-based method improves attention and boosts QA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked impact of input format on MLLMs' document understanding, countering the assumption that raw OCR text aids performance.

Method: Proposes a LaTex-based structure-preserving approach to encode documents, maintaining hierarchy and spatial relationships. Analyzes attention patterns.

Result: Structured text improves attention focus and reduces waste, enhancing QA performance across document types without model changes.

Conclusion: Input format significantly influences MLLMs' comprehension; structured encoding outperforms raw OCR, offering a simple yet effective enhancement.

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

*Junqi Jiang, Tom Bewley, Salim I. Amoukou, Francesco Leofante, Antonio Rago, Saumitra Mishra, Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Representation Consistency (RC) improves LLM performance by aggregating answers from multiple responses, considering both answer frequency and internal activation consistency, without extra model queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods for LLMs require complex modifications. RC aims to simplify this by leveraging internal model activations for better answer aggregation.

Method: RC aggregates answers by analyzing consistency in model activations (dense or sparse) during response generation, down-weighting inconsistent answers.

Result: Experiments show RC improves accuracy by up to 4% over baselines, with sparse activations aligning well with coherent reasoning.

Conclusion: RC is an effective, lightweight method for enhancing LLM performance during inference by leveraging representation consistency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

*Xiaoyan Feng, He Zhang, Yanjun Zhang, Leo Yu Zhang, Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiMark is a novel watermarking framework for LLMs that balances text quality, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about LLM-generated text authenticity by meeting regulatory demands for reliable identification mechanisms.

Method: BiMark uses a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism, multilayer architecture, and information encoding for multi-bit watermarking.

Result: Achieves up to 30% higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality and performs comparably on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BiMark successfully addresses the trade-off between text quality and watermarking requirements, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to decouple knowledge and reasoning in LLMs for financial tasks, lacking root cause analysis.

Method: Introduces FinEval-KR, a framework with knowledge and reasoning scores, and a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy. Includes a new Chinese financial reasoning dataset.

Result: LLM reasoning and higher-order cognitive abilities are key to accuracy, with knowledge application as a bottleneck. Specialized financial LLMs lag behind general models.

Conclusion: FinEval-KR provides a robust evaluation framework, highlighting reasoning and cognition as critical, and identifies gaps in knowledge application and specialized models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

### [48] [SignBart -- New approach with the skeleton sequence for Isolated Sign language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21592)
*Tinh Nguyen, Minh Khue Phan Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel BART-based encoder-decoder model for sign language recognition achieves high accuracy (96.04%) with fewer parameters, outperforming traditional methods by independently processing x and y coordinates while maintaining their interrelation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in sign language recognition, and overcoming limitations of traditional models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs.

Method: Uses a BART architecture to independently encode x and y coordinates of skeleton sequences, with Cross-Attention to maintain their interrelation.

Result: Achieves 96.04% accuracy on LSA-64, outperforms larger models, and generalizes well on WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable, efficient solution for sign language recognition, enhancing accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing.

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemBench, a benchmark for evaluating memory capabilities in LLM-based agents, addressing gaps in diversity and metrics of existing evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents lack diversity in memory levels and interactive scenarios, and comprehensive metrics.

Method: The authors construct a dataset with factual and reflective memory levels, and participation/observation scenarios, then develop MemBench for multi-aspect evaluation.

Result: MemBench evaluates memory capabilities in effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity, with the dataset and project publicly released.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive tool for assessing memory in LLM-based agents, aiding future research.

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a high-performance, explainable medical reasoning model that addresses challenges in specialized domains like reward hacking and training instability.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on synthetic medical data with parameter-efficient techniques (DoRA, rsLoRA), followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) with a multi-component reward system.

parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work

### [51] [Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21606)
*Parham Pourdavood, Michael Jacob, Terrence Deacon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper conceptualizes LLMs as cultural 'DNA,' preserving human symbolic patterns without understanding, enabling human creativity through reinterpretation and recursion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reframe LLMs not as autonomous intelligences or mimicry but as tools for cultural preservation and creativity, akin to DNA's role in biology.

Method: Analyzes four features—compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion—to compare LLMs to DNA in preserving cultural dynamics.

Result: LLMs serve as repositories of human culture, requiring human reinterpretation to become meaningful, fostering creativity and self-reflection.

Conclusion: LLMs are tools for cultural evolvability, aiding human self-reflection and hypothesis-generation without replacing human intelligence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a cost-effective method to adapt English-based LLMs to Korean, detailing the end-to-end process and achieving superior performance with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM performance in non-English languages like Korean is crucial, but the end-to-end training process is often proprietary and unclear.

Method: The approach involves collecting Korean datasets, preprocessing, training, creating benchmarks, and evaluating the adapted models (Thunder-LLM and Thunder-LLM-Ins).

Result: The adapted models outperform state-of-the-art models in Korean while using minimal data and computational resources.

Conclusion: The method is effective and efficient for adding new language capabilities to LLMs, with code and experience shared publicly.

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

*Dipak Meher, Carlotta Domeniconi, Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG is a modular framework for building cleaner knowledge graphs from legal texts, reducing noise and duplication by using type-aware coreference resolution and guided extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex, and legal case documents are unstructured and challenging for automated KG construction. Existing methods lack coreference resolution and produce noisy graphs.

Method: CORE-KG uses a two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via structured LLM prompts, and (2) guided entity and relationship extraction based on GraphRAG.

Result: CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28% and legal noise by 38.37%, producing cleaner graphs.

Conclusion: CORE-KG provides a robust foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks by improving KG quality and coherence.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze the reasoning processes of four advanced LLMs, revealing patterns in their exploration, problem-solving, and conclusions, and provides insights for model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks systematic comparison of LLMs' reasoning processes, especially their self-reflection patterns and cross-domain connections.

Method: A novel framework using keyword statistics and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm to analyze four models (GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, Grok-3) on a diverse dataset of real-world questions.

Result: Identified disparities in reasoning depth, intermediate step reliance, and similarity to GPT-o1, highlighting trade-offs between efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The study offers practical recommendations for improving model design and evaluation, with the framework publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of incorporating textual information into time series forecasting models, finding that gains are not universal and depend on model and data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and under what conditions multimodal integration (text + time series) improves forecasting performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of two multimodal paradigms (aligning-based and prompting-based methods) across 14 forecasting tasks in 7 domains.

Result: Multimodal methods do not always outperform unimodal baselines; gains depend on model capacity, alignment strategies, data availability, and complementary text signals.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines are provided for when multimodality aids forecasting, emphasizing model and data conditions.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaptGOT, a model combining adaptive representation learning and GOT (Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text) to improve POI embedding by addressing multi-context sampling, versatility, and generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current POI embedding methods lack effective multi-context sampling, versatility, and generalization. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: AdaptGOT integrates adaptive representation learning and GOT with three components: contextual neighborhood generation, advanced GOT representation with attention, and a MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show AdaptGOT outperforms existing methods in POI tasks.

Conclusion: AdaptGOT effectively addresses POI embedding challenges, offering superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

TL;DR: LastingBench is a framework to mitigate data leakage in QA benchmarks by identifying and rewriting leakage points, ensuring fairer LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of LLMs cheating on QA benchmarks due to memorization, undermining benchmark validity.

Method: Identify leakage points via perturbation and rewrite them to counterfactual ones, disrupting memorization.

Result: Significant performance gaps in QA benchmarks, proving LastingBench's efficacy in reducing memorization effects.

Conclusion: LastingBench provides a scalable solution to maintain benchmark robustness and fair LLM evaluations.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GARMLE-G is a framework that enhances medical language models by grounding outputs in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models rely on ICD codes, which lack clinical nuance. Clinicians use CPGs for diagnosis, creating a misalignment with current models.

Method: GARMLE-G integrates LLM predictions with EHR data, retrieves CPG snippets via embedding similarity, and fuses guideline content with model output.

Result: The prototype for hypertension diagnosis showed superior precision, relevance, and guideline adherence over baselines.

Conclusion: GARMLE-G offers a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free solution for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

TL;DR: Proposes a Timeline Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS), addressing limitations of general LLMs with a progressive optimization strategy and a novel dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with topic relevance and evolution in TLS, leading to irrelevant or inaccurate summaries.

Method: Introduces TIM with a large-scale TLS dataset, instruction tuning, and dual-alignment reward learning for semantic and temporal alignment.

Result: TIM shows robust performance in summarizing open-domain timelines, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: TIM effectively addresses TLS challenges, outperforming general LLMs in relevance and accuracy.

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

Method: Three experiments with GPT-4 generating comments as real or artificial partisan users, analyzing political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features against real data and a null model.

Result: GPT-4 produces realistic comments, leans toward consensus, and real vs. artificial comments are separable in semantic space but not manually.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4 can subtly influence political discourse, raising concerns about AI-driven manipulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Motivation: The lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset for human-evaluated proofs hinders progress in LLM-based mathematical proof generation.

Method: The authors present the OPC dataset, analyze critical questions in proof generation, and finetune an 8B-parameter model using OPC.

Result: The finetuned model performs on par with Gemini-2.5-Pro in evaluating proof correctness.

Conclusion: OPC is a valuable resource for advancing proof generation research, enabling rigorous analysis and model improvement.

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining human-experience-trained algorithms and synthetic data generation to improve ML text classification, especially for nuanced consumer complaints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns in natural language, particularly in consumer complaints, remains a challenge in ML text classification.

Method: Incorporates human-experience-trained algorithms and synthetic data generation using GANs refined by expert annotations.

Result: Aims to enhance classifier performance, reduce dataset costs, and improve evaluation metrics and robustness.

Conclusion: The approach seeks to advance text classification by leveraging expert-trained classifiers and high-quality synthetic data.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced text classification by
enabling automated understanding and categorization of complex, unstructured
textual data. However, accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and
contextual variations inherent in natural language, particularly within
consumer complaints, remains a challenge. This study addresses these issues by
incorporating human-experience-trained algorithms that effectively recognize
subtle semantic differences crucial for assessing consumer relief eligibility.
Furthermore, we propose integrating synthetic data generation methods that
utilize expert evaluations of generative adversarial networks and are refined
through expert annotations. By combining expert-trained classifiers with
high-quality synthetic data, our research seeks to significantly enhance
machine learning classifier performance, reduce dataset acquisition costs, and
improve overall evaluation metrics and robustness in text classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Doc2SAR, a new framework combining domain-specific tools and fine-tuned MLLMs, outperforms existing methods in extracting SARs from scientific documents, achieving 80.78% Table Recall on the DocSAR-200 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting SARs from diverse documents is challenging due to format heterogeneity and limitations of rule-based or general-purpose MLLM approaches.

Method: Proposes Doc2SAR, integrating domain-specific tools with supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, and introduces the DocSAR-200 benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Doc2SAR achieves 80.78% Table Recall, surpassing GPT-4o by 51.48%, and offers efficient inference with a web app.

Conclusion: Doc2SAR sets a new standard for SAR extraction, combining accuracy and practicality for drug and materials research.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied
by a web app.

*Li Zhou, Hao Jiang, Junjie Li, Zefeng Zhao, Feng Jiang, Wenyu Chen, Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probing framework to evaluate how explicit structural modeling enhances language models and explores MLPs as alternatives to GNNs, finding MLPs effective in encoding linguistic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show GNNs underutilize structural information, while MLPs perform well in structure-aware tasks, prompting an investigation into their roles.

Method: A modular probing framework isolates GNN components (message-passing and feature-transformation) to assess their individual contributions, using the Edge Probing Suite for evaluation.

Result: MLPs as feature-transformation modules improve linguistic knowledge in LMs, while GNNs relying solely on message-passing underperform.

Conclusion: MLPs are efficient alternatives to GNNs for encoding structural information, with feature-transformation operations being key to performance.

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ANUBHUTI is a dataset of 2000 Bangla dialect sentences (Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, Chittagong) annotated for sentiment and emotion, addressing the lack of resources for dialectal sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis for Bangla dialects is underexplored due to linguistic diversity and scarce annotated data.

Method: Created ANUBHUTI: 2000 sentences translated into four dialects, annotated thematically (Political, Religious, Neutral) and emotionally (7 emotions). Quality ensured via expert translation, dual annotation, and Cohen's Kappa.

Result: Strong inter-annotator consistency and refined dataset with balanced content.

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI bridges the resource gap for Bangla dialect sentiment analysis, enhancing NLP accuracy.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how parametric knowledge biases in LLMs like Llama 3.1 affect fact-checking outcomes in the HerO system, revealing biases in verdicts and evidence retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of parametric knowledge biases in LLMs on fact-checking systems, particularly the HerO baseline for FEVER-25.

Method: Examined bias effects by (1) analyzing Llama 3.1's parametric knowledge and (2) injecting intentional bias, testing verdicts and evidence retrieval under different prompts.

Result: Llama 3.1 labeled half the claims as 'Not Enough Evidence' and showed bias in evidence retrieval, with 50% unique evidence per perspective. Final verdicts remained stable despite retrieval differences.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit biases in fact-checking, affecting evidence retrieval but not final verdicts, highlighting the need for bias-aware systems.

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

*Alexandru Dumitru, V Venktesh, Adam Jatowt, Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the TLQA benchmark to evaluate LLMs' temporal understanding and list construction abilities, revealing their shortcomings in these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with temporal understanding and list construction in answers, especially for tasks involving multiple entities and time intervals. Existing benchmarks lack focus on this gap.

Method: Proposes the TLQA benchmark for structured list answers aligned with time periods, evaluating models in closed-book and open-domain settings.

Result: Current models show significant weaknesses in providing complete, temporally aligned answers in closed-book setups and require better retrieval in open-domain setups.

Conclusion: The TLQA benchmark highlights critical gaps in LLMs' capabilities, guiding future research to improve temporal and list-based reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

*Reem Alothman, Hafida Benhidour, Said Kerrache*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an XLNet-based model for detecting offensive language on social media, outperforming BERT in most tasks, and highlights the effectiveness of sampling strategies for class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of offensive content on social media necessitates automated detection systems due to impractical manual moderation.

Method: The study uses XLNet and BERT models, evaluated on the OLID dataset, with oversampling and undersampling to address class imbalance.

Result: XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and categorizing offenses, while BERT is slightly better at identifying targets. Sampling strategies improve performance.

Conclusion: Transfer learning and XLNet architectures show promise for robust offensive language detection on social media.

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

TL;DR: This survey reviews explainability techniques for LLMs, categorizing XAI methods by transformer architectures, evaluating their effectiveness, and exploring practical applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency in decision-making, hindering their adoption in high-stakes domains. This survey aims to systematically review XAI methods to enhance LLM explainability.

Method: Categorizes XAI methods based on transformer architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) and evaluates their explainability and practical use.

Result: Provides a comprehensive review of XAI techniques, their evaluation, and applications, highlighting gaps and challenges.

Conclusion: The survey guides future research toward developing transparent and responsible LLMs by addressing current limitations and exploring new directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

### [74] [Exploring the Structure of AI-Induced Language Change in Scientific English](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21817)
*Riley Galpin, Bryce Anderson, Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT influence scientific English, revealing semantic and pragmatic shifts rather than simple synonym replacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural changes in scientific English attributed to LLMs, focusing on whether shifts involve synonym replacement or broader semantic changes.

Method: Analyzed frequency trends and part-of-speech tagging in scientific abstracts from PubMed, focusing on 'spiking' and 'collapsing' words.

Result: Semantic clusters shift together, indicating LLMs induce semantic/pragmatic changes. Adjectives like 'important' decline, contrasting with abrupt spikes in other words.

Conclusion: LLMs primarily drive semantic and pragmatic language changes, not just lexical replacements, offering insights into technology's role in language evolution.

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-input neural framework combining transformer-based language encoding with semantic, stylometric, and metrical features achieves 71% accuracy in Persian poetry authorship attribution, with 97% accuracy for high-confidence predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of Persian classical poetry's linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects makes computational authorship attribution challenging.

Method: A multi-input neural framework integrates transformer-based language encoding with Word2Vec embeddings, stylometric measures, and metrical encodings, validated on a corpus of 647,653 verses.

Result: Weighted voting achieves 71% accuracy, while threshold-based filtering reaches 97% accuracy at 0.9 confidence (lower coverage).

Conclusion: The framework enhances authorship attribution and supports computational literature research, with potential for multilingual and generative applications.

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interpretability and computational efficiency issues in deep learning-based NLP by proposing a transparent alternative.

Method: Integrates five linguistic feature types into a logistic regression model for text classification.

Result: Achieves 84.89% accuracy on 20 Newsgroups dataset, surpassing TF-IDF by 3.32%.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth proves interpretable, efficient NLP models can compete with deep learning, questioning its necessity for high performance.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the consistency hypothesis in black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) for LLMs, formalizing it with three mathematical statements and tests. It evaluates the hypothesis across tasks and datasets, proposing data-free UQ methods that outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trust in LLM outputs by validating the assumption that generation consistency reflects confidence, enabling practical black-box UQ methods.

Method: Introduces three mathematical statements (e.g., 'Sim-Any') and statistical tests to formalize the consistency hypothesis, then evaluates it empirically across 8 datasets and 3 tasks. Proposes data-free UQ methods based on generation similarity.

Result: The 'Sim-Any' hypothesis is most actionable, and the proposed UQ methods outperform baselines, validating the consistency hypothesis's practical utility.

Conclusion: The consistency hypothesis holds empirically, and leveraging it with data-free UQ methods improves confidence estimation in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Result: DeepTalk reduces performance drop to 5.5% (vs. 20% in native MLLMs) and keeps latency under 0.5s.

Conclusion: DeepTalk effectively mitigates performance degradation in native MLLMs while maintaining seamless speech interaction.

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

*Taiga Someya, Ryo Yoshida, Hitomi Yanaka, Yohei Oseki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Derivational Probing to study how syntactic structures form across neural language model layers, revealing a bottom-up process in BERT where micro-syntactic structures integrate into macro-syntactic ones in higher layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how syntactic structures are constructed across layers in neural language models, as current derivations remain unclear.

Method: Proposes Derivational Probing to analyze micro- and macro-syntactic structures across BERT layers.

Result: Micro-syntactic structures emerge in lower layers and integrate into macro-syntactic ones in higher layers, with timing of integration affecting performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights a bottom-up derivation in BERT and emphasizes the importance of timing in integrating syntactic information for optimal performance.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

*Jian Zhang, Linhao Zhang, Bokai Lei, Chuhan Wu, Wei Jia, Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a specialized benchmark for evaluating speech-based LLMs, addressing gaps in existing text-focused methods by incorporating speech-specific challenges and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for speech LLMs are inadequate as they adapt text-based evaluations, ignoring speech-specific nuances like prosody and homophones. This hinders optimizing real-world Audio LLM performance.

Method: The authors curate real-world chat data, diversify speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. They also design a query-aware evaluation method for finer-grained assessment.

Result: Testing reveals significant performance differences among speech models across scenarios. The query-aware method enhances evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark offers valuable insights for improving speech model development and evaluation, addressing real-world challenges.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as world models (WMs) using a two-stage framework (Perception and Prediction) and a benchmark (WM-ABench), revealing significant limitations in basic WM abilities compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent VLMs show potential as general-purpose WMs, but their fundamental WM abilities lack systematic evaluation.

Method: A two-stage framework (Perception and Prediction) and WM-ABench benchmark are used to assess VLMs across 23 dimensions in 6 simulated environments.

Result: VLMs exhibit near-random accuracy in tasks like motion trajectory distinction and lack disentangled understanding (e.g., color biases in motion perception).

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between VLMs' WM abilities and human-level performance, highlighting limitations in basic world modeling.

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

### [82] [A Dual-Layered Evaluation of Geopolitical and Cultural Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21881)
*Sean Kim, Hyuhng Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates bias in LLMs, distinguishing model bias (from training) and inference bias (from query language), using a two-phase method: factual questions (Phase 1) and geopolitically sensitive disputes (Phase 2). Results show query language affects responses in Phase 1, while Phase 2 reveals interplay between training and query language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM behavior in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, especially where outputs influence public opinion or reinforce narratives.

Method: Two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 tests factual questions for consistency across query languages; Phase 2 examines geopolitically sensitive disputes. A manually curated dataset in four languages is used.

Result: Phase 1 shows query language-induced alignment; Phase 2 reveals interplay between model training and query language.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating LLM behavior in neutral and sensitive topics, aiding culturally aware deployment and multilingual evaluation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using checkpoint models from training trajectories to optimize data mixtures for language models, improving performance by up to 1.93% on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to model the relationship between data and tasks for language model training, leading to suboptimal data mixtures.

Method: Identify checkpoint models with emerging capabilities and use their aggregated first-order influence approximation over source data to optimize data mixtures.

Result: Significant improvements (up to 1.93%) on eight reasoning benchmarks in pretraining settings.

Conclusion: Checkpoint models can enhance data quality and optimize mixtures, demonstrating their underutilized potential in training.

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

*Mohamed Ahmed, Mohamed Abdelmouty, Mingyu Kim, Gunvanth Kandula, Alex Park, James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes hybrid jailbreak methods (GCG + PAIR and GCG + WordGame) combining token- and prompt-level attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in PTLMs, achieving high success rates and bypassing advanced defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of PTLMs and LLMs, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing token-level and prompt-level attacks have complementary limitations, motivating the development of hybrid approaches.

Method: Two hybrid methods (GCG + PAIR and GCG + WordGame) integrate token-level (GCG) and prompt-level (PAIR/WordGame) techniques to enhance jailbreak effectiveness. These were tested on Vicuna and Llama models.

Result: GCG + PAIR achieved a 91.6% ASR on Llama-3, surpassing PAIR's 58.4%. GCG + WordGame maintained over 80% ASR under strict evaluators. Both hybrids bypassed advanced defenses like Gradient Cuff and JBShield.

Conclusion: The hybrids expose new vulnerabilities in safety measures, emphasizing the need for holistic defenses against adaptive adversaries.

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PapersPlease, a benchmark with 3,700 moral dilemmas to evaluate LLMs' decision-making biases in immigration scenarios, revealing implicit preferences and varying responsiveness to social identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate biases in LLMs' decision-making, especially in role-playing scenarios like immigration inspections, using moral dilemmas based on human needs theory.

Method: LLMs act as immigration inspectors evaluating narratives constructed using ERG theory (Existence, Relatedness, Growth). Six LLMs are analyzed for decision patterns and responsiveness to social identities.

Result: LLMs show statistically significant biases, with implicit preferences and higher denial rates for marginalized identities in some models.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' biases in moral decision-making and the impact of social identities, providing a public benchmark for further research.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the stability of tool-integrated LLM agents, revealing vulnerabilities in each stage of tool invocation and noting open-source models are more prone to errors than proprietary ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations overlook agent stability, limiting real-world applicability due to potential crashes or abnormal behavior caused by internal/external factors.

Method: Investigates agent vulnerability across tool invocation stages: reading documentation, tool selection, parameter generation, and response processing.

Result: Agents are highly error-prone at each stage; open-source models are more vulnerable. Larger models don't significantly improve reasoning and may increase attack susceptibility.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for stability evaluation in LLM agents and provides insights for future development and assessment.

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

*Simon Münker, Nils Schwager, Achim Rettinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of LLMs to replicate human behavior in social network simulations, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation of empirical realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting findings on LLMs mimicking human behavior necessitate a deeper understanding of experimental designs for social simulations.

Method: A formal framework for social network simulation is proposed, with empirical testing of LLM-based user behavior imitation on X in English and German.

Result: Findings highlight the importance of validating social simulations by their empirical realism in fitted settings.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for more rigor in generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

TL;DR: The study evaluates machine vs. human translations in children's literature using stylometric analysis, revealing LLMs align closer to human translations in style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the stylistic differences and performance of machine translations (NMTs, LLMs) compared to human translations in children's literature.

Method: Constructed a Peter Pan corpus with 21 translations (7 HTs, 7 LLMs, 7 NMTs), analyzed using 447 linguistic features (generic and CTT-specific) and machine learning techniques.

Result: HTs and MTs differ in conjunction word distributions; LLMs outperform NMTs in style, aligning more closely with HTs.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in children's literature translation, matching human stylistic characteristics better than NMTs.

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

TL;DR: The study identifies Machine Translationese (MTese) in English-to-Chinese translations, using a large dataset and a five-layer feature set. It distinguishes original Chinese texts from NMT and LLM outputs, noting shorter sentences and more adversative conjunctions in MT. LLMs show higher lexical diversity, while NMTs use more brackets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the linguistic peculiarities (MTese) in machine-translated English-to-Chinese news texts, focusing on under-researched aspects.

Method: Constructed a large dataset with 4 sub-corpora, applied a five-layer feature set, and used a chi-square ranking algorithm for feature selection in classification and clustering tasks.

Result: Confirmed MTese in NMTs and LLMs. Original Chinese texts were distinguishable from MT outputs. LLMs had higher lexical diversity; NMTs used more brackets. No significant differences between Chinese and foreign LLMs.

Conclusion: MTese is evident in English-to-Chinese translations, with distinct patterns in NMTs and LLMs. The study provides insights for improving MT systems.

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning and the issue of overthinking in models.

Method: Empirical analysis of reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3), a reward-based sampling strategy to optimize first reasoning steps, and creation of a benchmark with flawed reasoning steps.

Result: The first reasoning step significantly affects final predictions; the proposed strategy reduces inference costs by 70% without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of initial reasoning steps, offers a cost-effective solution, and provides a benchmark for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

(MDC) with expert annotations of anaphoric and deictic reference. MDC's
task-orientated, multi-turn, situated dialogue in a dynamic environment has
motivated multiple annotation efforts, owing to the interesting linguistic

TL;DR: The paper analyzes linguistic complexity in Twitter content across contested topics (COVID-19, COP26, Russia-Ukraine war), revealing variations based on account type, political leaning, reliability, and sentiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language on social media reflects societal and ideological structures, especially in influential users' content.

Method: Combined multiple textual complexity measures to assess language use across four dimensions: account type, political leaning, reliability, and sentiment.

Result: Significant differences in language complexity were found across all dimensions, with negative/offensive content using more complex language and shared jargon among similar profiles.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into sociolinguistic dynamics on digital platforms, showing how language mirrors ideological and social structures online.

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

TL;DR: The paper isolates and analyzes the sub-network in GPT-2 Small responsible for subject-verb agreement, identifying a small but effective circuit for verb conjugation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GPT-2 Small processes subject-verb agreement by isolating the specific sub-network involved.

Method: Uses prompts with singular/plural subjects, performance verification, automatic circuit discovery via path patching, and logit attribution.

Result: A small fraction of the network suffices for basic verb conjugation, but more complexity requires additional components.

Conclusion: The study highlights the efficiency of GPT-2's sub-networks for specific tasks, though complexity demands more resources.

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

### [94] [QuickSilver -- Speeding up LLM Inference through Dynamic Token Halting, KV Skipping, Contextual Token Fusion, and Adaptive Matryoshka Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22396)
*Danush Khanna, Aditya Kumar Guru, Srivarshinee Sridhar, Zidan Ahmed, Rubhav Bahirwani, Meetu Malhotra, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das, Kripabandhu Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QuickSilver is a token-level framework for runtime optimization of LLMs, reducing FLOPs by up to 39.6% without altering model weights or structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency and energy consumption dominate LLM costs, but existing optimization methods require retraining or architectural changes. QuickSilver aims to address this without such constraints.

Method: QuickSilver uses Dynamic Token Halting, KV Cache Skipping, and Contextual Token Fusion to optimize inference without modifying the model.

Result: Achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with minimal perplexity increase (<=0.2) on GPT-2 and Llama-2.

Conclusion: QuickSilver offers a modular, efficient solution for LLM inference optimization, compatible with frozen models and no auxiliary networks.

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

*Iliass Ayaou, Denis Cavallucci, Hicham Chibane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAPFAM is a new domain-aware patent retrieval dataset addressing gaps like explicit labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage, and manageable size for sub-document experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patent retrieval datasets lack explicit in/out-of-domain labeling, balanced query domains, and manageable sizes for moderate computational resources.

Method: Constructed at the simple-family level, DAPFAM includes 1,247 domain-balanced queries and 45,336 target families, enriched with relevance judgments and IPC-based labeling.

Result: The dataset offers 49,869 evaluation pairs, supports sub-document retrieval, and baseline experiments reveal challenges in cross-domain patent retrieval.

Conclusion: DAPFAM fills critical gaps in patent retrieval datasets and is publicly available for research.

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now
the access link is this repository:

TL;DR: HyperCLOVA X THINK is a reasoning-focused large language model, pre-trained on 6 trillion Korean and English tokens, with competitive performance on Korean benchmarks and robust bilingual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-performance, bilingual (Korean-English) large language model tailored for reasoning tasks, with efficient training and broad applicability.

Method: Pre-trained on a mix of Korean and English data, augmented with synthetic Korean data, using a Peri-LN Transformer scaled with μP. Post-trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, with a vision-augmented variant.

Result: Competitive performance on Korean benchmarks (KMMLU, CSAT, etc.), robust bilingual consistency, and vision-augmented performance matching GPT-4.1 on KCSAT STEM, with lower training compute.

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK is a strong foundation for Korean AI innovation and a valuable resource globally, with plans for open-source and business-friendly adaptations.

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCO is a framework to train critic models using refinement signals, improving LLM critique-refinement loops by focusing on effective critiques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on effective critiques for improving LLM responses or generating them.

Method: RCO uses a feedback loop where critiques guide refinements, with critique utility (CU) as a reward signal.

Result: RCO outperforms traditional methods in critique quality and refinement across five tasks.

Conclusion: RCO enhances LLM critique-refinement loops without direct critique preference assessment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

*Patrick Haller, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich, Lena A. Jäger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Questionnaire Modeling (QM) to improve bias evaluation stability in LLMs by using human survey data as context, showing instruction tuning can alter bias direction and larger models leverage context better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating political biases in LLMs lack stability, making model comparisons unreliable. The paper aims to address this by introducing a more context-aware approach.

Method: Proposes Questionnaire Modeling (QM), a probing task using human survey data as in-context examples to evaluate biases in LLMs.

Result: QM improves bias evaluation stability; instruction tuning can change bias direction; larger models leverage context more effectively and show smaller bias scores.

Conclusion: QM offers a more reliable method for bias evaluation in LLMs, with insights into how instruction tuning and model size influence bias.

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel GPT-4o-based approach for detecting personal data in structured datasets outperforms existing methods by leveraging contextual information, showing strong results on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved personal data detection in structured datasets, especially in real-world scenarios where contextual information is crucial.

Method: Uses GPT-4o to incorporate contextual information from feature names and dataset descriptions, comparing it to Microsoft Presidio and CASSED on various datasets.

Result: GPT-4o-based approach outperforms others on real-world datasets (e.g., MIMIC-Demo-Ext) and benefits from contextual information in Kaggle/OpenML datasets.

Conclusion: More real-world datasets with personal information are needed to advance the field of personal data detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

*Qingquan Li, Shaoyu Dou, Kailai Shao, Chao Chen, Haixiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores biases in LLM-as-a-Judge systems, focusing on scoring-based evaluations, and proposes a framework to assess and mitigate these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic research on biases in scoring-based evaluations within LLM-as-a-Judge systems, which affects fairness and reliability.

Method: The study defines scoring bias, constructs an evaluation dataset via data synthesis, and designs multi-faceted metrics to assess bias.

Result: Experiments show scoring biases disrupt judge models' stability, with insights on prompt design and bias mitigation.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for addressing scoring biases and offers practical guidance for improving LLM-as-a-Judge systems.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

*Daichi Kato, Ryo Ueda, Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores why human language parsing isn't random by testing modifications to experimental setups involving hierarchical inputs and surprisal-based objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why human parsing strategies aren't random, despite random strategies achieving high communication accuracy in prior studies.

Method: Modify experiments with (I) complex hierarchical inputs and (II) a surprisal-related term in the objective function to test random parsing strategies.

Result: Evaluates whether random parsing strategies still achieve high communication accuracy under these conditions.

Conclusion: The study aims to clarify the role of hierarchical structures and surprisal in human-like parsing strategies.

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

TL;DR: A state-of-the-art Czech grammar error correction (GEC) system using Transformer-based neural translation, featuring real-time synthetic error generation and outperforming in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Czech GEC by leveraging synthetic error generation and neural translation, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Method: Transformer architecture with dynamic synthetic error generation, experiments on Czech GEC corpora, error strategies, domain balancing, and LLM evaluation.

Result: Best-performing model excels in accuracy and efficiency, with code and models publicly available.

Conclusion: The system sets a new benchmark for Czech GEC, combining synthetic data and neural translation effectively.

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the
art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation
approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its
real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences
with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in
performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model
links are available on https://github.com/ufal/tsd2025-gec.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark and MAI-DxO, an AI orchestrator, to improve diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness in medicine by emulating iterative clinical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of AI in medicine lack real-world complexity. The paper aims to better reflect clinical practice by simulating iterative diagnostic processes.

Method: The study transforms 304 NEJM-CPC cases into stepwise encounters, using MAI-DxO to simulate physician panels, propose diagnoses, and select cost-effective tests.

Result: MAI-DxO achieves 80-85.5% diagnostic accuracy (vs. 20% for physicians) and reduces costs by 20-70%. Performance generalizes across multiple AI models.

Conclusion: AI systems like MAI-DxO, designed for iterative reasoning and judicious action, can enhance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in clinical care.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

*James Chua, Edward Rees, Hunar Batra, Samuel R. Bowman, Julian Michael, Ethan Perez, Miles Turpin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can misrepresent model reasoning due to biases. A new dataset identifies 9 biases affecting models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-8b. Bias-augmented consistency training (BCT) reduces biased reasoning by 86% on held-out tasks and generalizes to other biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of biased reasoning in language models caused by CoT prompting, which can rationalize answers in line with user opinions or other spurious patterns.

Method: Introduce bias-augmented consistency training (BCT), an unsupervised fine-tuning method that ensures consistent reasoning across biased and unbiased prompts. Tested on a suite of nine biases across seven QA tasks.

Result: BCT reduces biased reasoning by 86% on held-out tasks for GPT-3.5-Turbo and generalizes to other biases, reducing biased reasoning by 37% on average.

Conclusion: BCT is a promising method for mitigating biased reasoning in language models, even for unknown biases or tasks without ground truth labels.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) has the potential to improve the
explainability of language model reasoning. But CoT can also systematically
misrepresent the factors influencing models' behavior -- for example,
rationalizing answers in line with a user's opinion.
  We first create a new dataset of 9 different biases that affect GPT-3.5-Turbo
and Llama-8b models. These consist of spurious-few-shot patterns, post hoc
rationalization, and sycophantic settings. Models switch to the answer implied
by the bias, without mentioning the effect of the bias in the CoT.
  To mitigate this biased reasoning problem, we introduce bias-augmented
consistency training (BCT), an unsupervised fine-tuning scheme that trains
models to give consistent reasoning across prompts with and without biasing
features. We construct a suite testing nine forms of biased reasoning on seven
question-answering tasks, and find that applying BCT to GPT-3.5-Turbo with one
bias reduces the rate of biased reasoning by 86\% on held-out tasks. Moreover,
this model generalizes to other forms of bias, reducing biased reasoning on
held-out biases by an average of 37\%. As BCT generalizes to held-out biases
and does not require gold labels, this method may hold promise for reducing
biased reasoning from as-of-yet unknown biases and on tasks where ground truth
reasoning is unavailable.

*Vittoria Dentella, Fritz Guenther, Evelina Leivada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether increasing the size of LLMs bridges performance gaps with humans in grammaticality judgments, finding ChatGPT-4 outperforms humans on grammatical sentences but shows less stability. Scaling alone may not fully align LLM performance with human sensitivity to (un)grammaticality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if model scaling can address qualitative and quantitative differences between LLMs and humans in language tasks, particularly grammaticality judgments.

Method: Three LLMs (Bard, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4) were tested on grammaticality judgments involving anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity. Human performance (n=80) was compared to ChatGPT-4's results (n=1,200 judgments).

Result: ChatGPT-4 was more accurate than humans (80% vs. 76%) but only on grammatical sentences. It was less stable (12.5% vs. 9.6% oscillating answers). Scaling improves performance but doesn't fully align LLMs with human sensitivity to (un)grammaticality.

Conclusion: While scaling enhances LLM performance, it alone may not resolve differences in sensitivity to grammaticality between humans and models, highlighting fundamental differences in language learning.

Abstract: Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language
Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language. LLM performance in some
language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that
of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are
amenable to model size. This work investigates the critical role of model
scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences
between humans and models. We test three LLMs from different families (Bard,
137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a
grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding,
comparatives, and negative polarity. N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored
for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated
presentation of a prompt. Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are
compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli. We find that humans are
overall less accurate than ChatGPT-4 (76% vs. 80% accuracy, respectively), but
that this is due to ChatGPT-4 outperforming humans only in one task condition,
namely on grammatical sentences. Additionally, ChatGPT-4 wavers more than
humans in its answers (12.5% vs. 9.6% likelihood of an oscillating answer,
respectively). Thus, while increased model size may lead to better performance,
LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality the same way as humans are.
It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue. We
interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico,
identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence,
(ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic
hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference.

### [106] [RLSF: Fine-tuning LLMs via Symbolic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16661)
*Piyush Jha, Prithwish Jana, Pranavkrishna Suresh, Arnav Arora, Vijay Ganesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSF introduces symbolic feedback for fine-tuning LLMs, outperforming traditional methods in domain-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment, and traditional fine-tuning lacks symbolic knowledge integration.

Method: RLSF uses symbolic tools to provide token-level feedback via poly-sized certificates, correcting errors without differentiable systems.

Result: RLSF-based fine-tuning outperforms traditional methods in program synthesis, chemistry tasks, and Game of 24.

Conclusion: RLSF bridges symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling smaller models to surpass larger ones in domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with
tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional
fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic
domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers),
and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models.
  We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel
fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers,
and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses
poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify
and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without
requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap
between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with
domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional
reward signals.
  Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs
outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have
some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from
natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks,
and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables
relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that
are orders of magnitude larger.

*Qing Yang, Qiyao Peng, Hongtao Liu, Kai Liu, Bing Qin, Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in LLM pre-training by proposing a multi-bucket data composition method, improving efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length data composition in LLM pre-training causes issues like truncation, noise, and computational overhead.

Method: Introduces three metrics (padding, truncation, concatenation ratios) and a multi-bucket method for adaptive data organization.

Result: The proposed method enhances LLM pre-training efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The multi-bucket approach offers a flexible and efficient solution for LLM pre-training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various tasks, with pre-training stage serving as the cornerstone of their
capabilities. However, the conventional fixed-length data composition strategy
for pre-training presents several practical challenges. When using shorter
sequences, documents are often truncated, potentially leading to information
loss and affecting the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.
Conversely, longer sequences require concatenation of multiple documents, which
can introduce noise and affect the natural document boundaries and semantic
coherence as well as require substantial computational overhead. To address
these challenges, we first establish three quantitative metrics for evaluating
data composition quality: padding ratio, truncation ratio, and concatenation
ratio. Building upon these metrics, we propose a novel multi-bucket data
composition method that transcends the fixed-length paradigm. Our approach
adaptively organizes training data to achieve optimal composition quality as
measured by the proposed metrics, offering a more flexible and efficient
approach for pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments and the results
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances both the efficiency

*Hongcheng Ding, Xuanze Zhao, Ruiting Deng, Shamsul Nahar Abdullah, Deshinta Arrova Dewi, Zixiao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module improves sentiment analysis performance by dynamically adjusting task weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underperformance of fine-tuned LLMs in sentiment analysis due to diverse task complexities and inflexible constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning.

Method: Proposes a plug-and-play DAO module with dynamic adaptive loss to adjust task weights based on importance and data characteristics.

Result: Achieves 15.58% improvement in MSE and 1.24% in ACC on standard and financial text datasets.

Conclusion: The DAO module provides an effective, flexible solution for multi-task learning in sentiment analysis, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in various domains, such as business
intelligence and financial forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) have
become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task
learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning
for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in
managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in
multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics,
further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a
novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO)
module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible
solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is
dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to
different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics
during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text
dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance.
Specifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy
(ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.

*Haichuan Hu, Congqing He, Xiaochen Xie, Quanjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LRP4RAG uses Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to detect hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations persist in RAG due to incomplete knowledge extraction and insufficient understanding, leading to irrelevant or contradictory responses.

Method: LRP computes input-output relevance in RAG, followed by extraction, resampling, and classification to detect hallucinations.

Result: Extensive experiments show LRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines in detecting RAG hallucinations.

Conclusion: LRP4RAG is the first LRP-based method for RAG hallucination detection, proving effective in experiments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a primary technique for
mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, incomplete
knowledge extraction and insufficient understanding can still mislead LLMs to
produce irrelevant or even contradictory responses, which means hallucinations
persist in RAG. In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations
in RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the
input and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and
resampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into
multiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for
detecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that
LRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines.

*Junyoung Lee, Ninad Dixit, Kaustav Chakrabarti, S. Supraja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PQ-GCN, a graph convolutional network for question classification, outperforming traditional methods and competing with language models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving question classification in educational tools to enhance adaptive learning and downstream tasks like information retrieval.

Method: Proposes Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN) with phrase-based features for better classification.

Result: PQ-GCN outperforms baseline graph methods in low-resource settings and competes with larger language models.

Conclusion: PQ-GCN offers a parameter-efficient, context-aware solution for question classification, bridging graph neural networks and education.

Abstract: Effective question classification is crucial for AI-driven educational tools,
enabling adaptive learning systems to categorize questions by skill area,
difficulty level, and competence. It not only supports educational diagnostics
and analytics but also enhances complex downstream tasks like information
retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant
categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and
conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in
question statements, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a novel
approach leveraging graph convolutional networks, named Phrase Question-Graph
Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN). Through PQ-GCN, we evaluate the incorporation
of phrase-based features to enhance classification performance on question
datasets of various domains and characteristics. The proposed method, augmented
with phrase-based features, outperform baseline graph-based methods in
low-resource settings, and performs competitively against language model-based
methods with a fraction of their parameter size. Our findings offer a possible
solution for more context-aware, parameter-efficient question classification,
bridging the gap between graph neural network research and its educational
applications.

*Tianyu Gao, Alexander Wettig, Howard Yen, Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of language models for long-context tasks, introducing a robust evaluation protocol and optimal data mixes. The final model, ProLong-8B, achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language models' ability to effectively use long-context information, addressing limitations of existing evaluation methods and training approaches.

Method: Establishes a reliable evaluation protocol, experiments with data mixes for continued pre-training, and optimizes SFT design choices like position extrapolation.

Result: ProLong-8B outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on long-context tasks, using fewer tokens, and processes up to 512K tokens.

Conclusion: Combining high-quality short and long-context data, training beyond evaluation lengths, and using short instruction datasets for SFT yields superior long-context performance.

Abstract: We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language
model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first
establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- instead
of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set
of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this
better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we
run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the
instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position
extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent
sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality
short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation
length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short
instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final
model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens,
demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized
models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the
majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during
long-context training. Additionally, ProLong can effectively process up to 512K
tokens, one of the longest context windows of publicly available LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores uncertainty in LLM benchmark scores, suggesting a cost-effective method to quantify it and improve reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few studies quantify uncertainty in LLM benchmarks due to time and cost constraints.

Method: Uses cardinal direction benchmarks to analyze the impact of repeated experiments on mean score and prediction intervals.

Result: Proposes a simple method for quantifying benchmark score uncertainty.

Conclusion: Recommends practices for reproducible LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are stochastic, and not all models give
deterministic answers, even when setting temperature to zero with a fixed
random seed. However, few benchmark studies attempt to quantify uncertainty,
partly due to the time and cost of repeated experiments. We use benchmarks
designed for testing LLMs' capacity to reason about cardinal directions to
explore the impact of experimental repeats on mean score and prediction
interval. We suggest a simple method for cost-effectively quantifying the
uncertainty of a benchmark score and make recommendations concerning
reproducible LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARSE, a framework for efficient sentiment analysis with LLMs, improving accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs for domain-specific sentiment analysis is challenging due to computational constraints and fine-tuning needs.

Method: DARSE uses a coarse-grained greedy algorithm, fine-grained exploration, and dynamic rank allocation to optimize LLM layers.

Result: DARSE improves MSE by 15.1% and accuracy by 4.3% over prior methods.

Conclusion: DARSE balances efficiency and performance, offering a promising solution for LLM-based sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important for assessing public
opinion and informing decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have
revolutionized this field by capturing nuanced language patterns. However,
adapting LLMs to domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks remains challenging
due to computational constraints and the need for optimal fine-tuning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Adaptive Rank Space
Exploration (DARSE) framework for efficient and effective sentiment analysis
using LLMs. DARSE consists of a coarse-grained greedy algorithm to identify the
optimal rank range, a fine-grained exploration algorithm to refine rank
selection, and a dynamic rank allocation method to determine the optimal rank
combination for each LLM layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARSE
significantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy, achieving a 15.1%
improvement in MSE and a 4.3% improvement in accuracy compared to previous
work. Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and
model performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLMs struggle with infrequent entities in ultra-fine typing tasks; knowledge-infused methods help but are not a complete solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the limitations of PLMs' acquired knowledge, especially for rare entities, and propose improvements.

Method: Proposed a heuristic to approximate PLMs' pre-training distribution and tested entity-typing approaches.

Result: PLMs perform poorly on rare entities; knowledge-infused methods partially mitigate this.

Conclusion: Solutions beyond PLMs are needed for infrequent entities in ultra-fine typing tasks.

Abstract: Due to their capacity to acquire world knowledge from large corpora,
pre-trained language models (PLMs) are extensively used in ultra-fine entity
typing tasks where the space of labels is extremely large. In this work, we
explore the limitations of the knowledge acquired by PLMs by proposing a novel
heuristic to approximate the pre-training distribution of entities when the
pre-training data is unknown. Then, we systematically demonstrate that
entity-typing approaches that rely solely on the parametric knowledge of PLMs
struggle significantly with entities at the long tail of the pre-training
distribution, and that knowledge-infused approaches can account for some of
these shortcomings. Our findings suggest that we need to go beyond PLMs to
produce solutions that perform well for infrequent entities.

TL;DR: MAPO improves prompt optimization for LLMs using momentum-based gradients, beam search, and UCB, outperforming ProTeGi in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of prompt optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) by avoiding local minima and oscillations.

Method: Uses positive natural language gradients, momentum-based extension, beam search, and UCB for balanced candidate expansion and selection.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, fewer API calls, and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi.

Conclusion: MAPO is a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.

Abstract: Momentum-Aided Prompt Optimization (MAPO) enhances the efficiency and
efficacy of prompt optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs). Building on
ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based
extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO
avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and
selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time
with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust
and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.

### [116] [Are Triggers Needed for Document-Level Event Extraction?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08708)
*Shaden Shaar, Wayne Chen, Maitreyi Chatterjee, Barry Wang, Wenting Zhao, Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of triggers in document-level event extraction, finding their usefulness varies based on dataset characteristics and task-specific information. Surprisingly, even random triggers aid prompt-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses on sentence-level event extraction with triggers, but their role in document-level extraction is unexplored. This paper aims to fill that gap.

Method: Analyzed multiple transformer-based models on three datasets, testing triggers of varying quality (human-annotated, LLM-generated, keyword-based, random).

Result: Trigger usefulness depends on dataset (e.g., event frequency) and task context (e.g., event schemas). Random triggers still aid prompt-based learning.

Conclusion: Triggers' role in document-level event extraction is context-dependent, and their presence, even random, can benefit learning approaches.

Abstract: Most existing work on event extraction has focused on sentence-level texts
and presumes the identification of a trigger-span -- a word or phrase in the
input that evokes the occurrence of an event of interest. Event arguments are
then extracted with respect to the trigger. Indeed, triggers are treated as
integral to, and trigger detection as an essential component of, event
extraction. In this paper, we provide the first investigation of the role of
triggers for the more difficult and much less studied task of document-level
event extraction. We analyze their usefulness in multiple end-to-end and
pipelined transformer-based event extraction models for three document-level
event extraction datasets, measuring performance using triggers of varying
quality (human-annotated, LLM-generated, keyword-based, and random). We find
that whether or not systems benefit from explicitly extracting triggers depends
both on dataset characteristics (i.e. the typical number of events per
document) and task-specific information available during extraction (i.e.
natural language event schemas). Perhaps surprisingly, we also observe that the
mere existence of triggers in the input, even random ones, is important for
prompt-based in-context learning approaches to the task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares machine learning methods (SVM with TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BoW, and BERT) for fake news detection, finding BERT most accurate but SVM with BoW/TF-IDF competitive and computationally lighter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urgent need for reliable fake news detection systems due to rapid misinformation spread online.

Method: Uses SVM with TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BoW, and BERT for fake news detection, including preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.

Result: BERT achieves 99.98% accuracy and F1-score of 0.9998; SVM with BoW reaches 99.81% accuracy and F1-score of 0.9980.

Conclusion: BERT outperforms SVM, but SVM with BoW/TF-IDF offers competitive performance with lower computational costs.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms,
underscores the urgent need for reliable detection systems. This study explores
the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing,
specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect fake news. We
employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW),
evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news.
Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language
model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps,
rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most
effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior
accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear
kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81%
accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite
BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization
methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the
advantage of lower computational requirements.

Conclusion: iPrOp effectively aids non-technical users and researchers in optimizing prompts for better performance.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has made significant contributions to the era of large
language models, yet its effectiveness depends on the skills of a prompt
author. This paper introduces $\textit{iPrOp}$, a novel interactive prompt
optimization approach, to bridge manual prompt engineering and automatic prompt
optimization while offering users the flexibility to assess evolving prompts.
We aim to provide users with task-specific guidance to enhance human engagement
in the optimization process, which is structured through prompt variations,
informative instances, predictions generated by large language models along
with their corresponding explanations, and relevant performance metrics. This
approach empowers users to choose and further refine the prompts based on their
individual preferences and needs. It can not only assist non-technical domain
experts in generating optimal prompts tailored to their specific tasks or
domains, but also enable to study the intrinsic parameters that influence the
performance of prompt optimization. The evaluation shows that our approach has
the capability to generate improved prompts, leading to enhanced task
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEFT, a sparsity-based PEFT method, and evaluates salience metrics, finding gradient-based metrics reliable. Static masking is efficient, while dynamic masking offers no benefits. SPEFT outperforms other methods in NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore sparsity-based PEFT (SPEFT) as a flexible alternative to low-rank methods like LoRA, and systematically evaluate salience metrics for SPEFT.

Method: Uses gradient-based metrics for SPEFT, compares static and dynamic masking strategies, and evaluates performance across NLP tasks.

Result: Gradient-based metrics are reliable; static masking is efficient without performance loss. SPEFT outperforms other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: SPEFT is a simple, effective PEFT method, challenging the need for complexity. The open-source framework provides a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has gained prominence through low-rank
adaptation methods like LoRA. In this paper, we focus on sparsity-based PEFT
(SPEFT), which introduces trainable sparse adaptations to the weight matrices
in the model, offering greater flexibility in selecting fine-tuned parameters
compared to low-rank methods. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of
salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify
simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best
alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance.
Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that
static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers
efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no
substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT
consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs, providing a simple
yet effective baseline for SPEFT. Our work challenges the notion that
complexity is necessary for effective PEFT, while our open-source framework
establishes a reproducible benchmark for future research, which is available at

TL;DR: CachED enables end-to-end training of transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization without truncation, using gradient caching and sliding windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the quadratic memory consumption and training-test mismatch in long document summarization.

Method: Non-overlapping sliding windows on input documents, gradient caching at the decoder, and re-computing hidden vectors during backpropagation.

Result: CachED BART processes over 500K tokens during training and achieves superior performance without extra parameters.

Conclusion: CachED effectively addresses training challenges for long documents, improving summarization performance.

Abstract: Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document
summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory
consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend
the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still
difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch
between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient
$\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an
approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based
encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation.
Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents,
followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached
at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the
hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long
document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than
500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using
any additional parameters.

*Tianyu Gao, Alexander Wettig, Luxi He, Yihe Dong, Sadhika Malladi, Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeCo (Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown) improves pre-training efficiency and model steerability by incorporating metadata during training and later removing it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficiently learning from diverse and heterogeneous pre-training data sources.

Method: MeCo adds metadata (e.g., URLs) during pre-training, followed by a cooldown phase with standard text. This enables normal model function without metadata.

Result: MeCo accelerates pre-training, reduces data needs by 33%, and allows steering models via metadata (real or fabricated) during inference.

Conclusion: MeCo is a simple, overhead-free method that enhances model capability and steerability.

Abstract: The vast diversity of styles, domains, and quality levels present in language
model pre-training corpora is essential in developing general model
capabilities, but efficiently learning and deploying the correct behaviors
exemplified in each of these heterogeneous data sources is challenging. To
address this, we propose a new method, termed Metadata Conditioning then
Cooldown (MeCo), to incorporate additional learning cues during pre-training.
MeCo first provides metadata (e.g., URLs like www$.$wikipedia$.$org) alongside
the text during training and later uses a cooldown phase with only the standard
text, thereby enabling the model to function normally even without metadata.
MeCo significantly accelerates pre-training across different model scales (600M
to 8B parameters) and training sources (C4, RefinedWeb, and DCLM). For
instance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task
performance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data. Additionally,
MeCo enables us to steer language models by conditioning the inference prompt
on either real or fabricated metadata that encodes the desired properties of
the output: for example, prepending wikipedia$.$org to reduce harmful
generations or factquizmaster$.$com (fabricated) to improve common knowledge
task performance. We also demonstrate that MeCo is compatible with different
types of metadata, such as model-generated topics. MeCo is remarkably simple,
adds no computational overhead, and demonstrates promise in producing more
capable and steerable language models.

*Steven H. Wang, Maksim Zubkov, Kexin Fan, Sarah Harrell, Yuyang Sun, Wei Chen, Andreas Plesner, Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACORD is the first expert-annotated retrieval benchmark for contract drafting, featuring complex clauses and ranked query-clause pairs. It aims to improve clause retrieval for legal drafting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lawyers rely on precedent clauses for contract drafting, but existing tools lack expert-annotated benchmarks for complex clauses. ACORD addresses this gap.

Method: ACORD includes 114 queries and 126,000+ query-clause pairs, ranked 1-5 stars. Bi-encoder retrievers and LLM re-rankers are tested for retrieval.

Result: The bi-encoder retriever with LLM re-rankers shows promise but needs improvement for complex legal tasks.

Conclusion: ACORD serves as a valuable benchmark for NLP and IR in legal drafting, though further advancements are required.

Abstract: Information retrieval, specifically contract clause retrieval, is
foundational to contract drafting because lawyers rarely draft contracts from
scratch; instead, they locate and revise the most relevant precedent. We
introduce the Atticus Clause Retrieval Dataset (ACORD), the first retrieval
benchmark for contract drafting fully annotated by experts. ACORD focuses on
complex contract clauses such as Limitation of Liability, Indemnification,
Change of Control, and Most Favored Nation. It includes 114 queries and over
126,000 query-clause pairs, each ranked on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. The task
is to find the most relevant precedent clauses to a query. The bi-encoder
retriever paired with pointwise LLMs re-rankers shows promising results.
However, substantial improvements are still needed to effectively manage the
complex legal work typically undertaken by lawyers. As the first retrieval
benchmark for contract drafting annotated by experts, ACORD can serve as a
valuable IR benchmark for the NLP community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of 600,000+ high-quality QA pairs from the AoPS forum, and LiveAoPSBench, a contamination-resistant benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Olympiad-level math. Fine-tuning on AoPS-Instruct improves LLM reasoning, but performance declines over time, indicating reliance on pre-training exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited and unreliable datasets for Olympiad-level math problems constrain LLM training and evaluation. The AoPS forum offers a rich, untapped resource for high-quality problem-solving data.

Method: An automated pipeline extracts QA pairs from the AoPS forum to create AoPS-Instruct. LiveAoPSBench, an evolving benchmark, is built from the latest forum data to resist contamination.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct enhances reasoning across benchmarks. Performance declines over time, suggesting pre-training exposure bias.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable method for high-quality math datasets and insights into LLM reasoning limitations, with tools available for public use.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their
ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and
evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of
available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems
requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks
are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper,
we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art
of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level
problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a
method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in
AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their
reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic
pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with
timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a
contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we
observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their
success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true
reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and
maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning,
offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in
this domain. Our benchmark and code is available at

Motivation: To enhance deep learning architectures in NLP using quantum computing, addressing limitations of conventional attention mechanisms.

Method: Integrates a quantum-enhanced attention mechanism via parameterized variational circuits and entanglement-aware kernel similarities in a classical Transformer.

Result: Demonstrates improved efficiency, representational capacity, globally coherent attention maps, and more separable latent features with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Quantum-classical hybrid models offer a powerful, resource-efficient alternative to traditional attention mechanisms in NLP.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have opened new pathways for enhancing
deep learning architectures, particularly in domains characterized by
high-dimensional and context-rich data such as natural language processing
(NLP). In this work, we present a hybrid classical-quantum Transformer model
that integrates a quantum-enhanced attention mechanism into the standard
classical architecture. By embedding token representations into a quantum
Hilbert space via parameterized variational circuits and exploiting
entanglement-aware kernel similarities, the model captures complex semantic
relationships beyond the reach of conventional dot-product attention. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across diverse NLP benchmarks,
showing improvements in both efficiency and representational capacity. The
results section reveal that the quantum attention layer yields globally
coherent attention maps and more separable latent features, while requiring
comparatively fewer parameters than classical counterparts. These findings
highlight the potential of quantum-classical hybrid models to serve as a
powerful and resource-efficient alternative to existing attention mechanisms in
NLP.

### [125] [ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00299)
*Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Peijie Dong, Zeyu Li, Yue Liu, Bo Li, Xuming Hu, Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkKV introduces semantic chunk-based KV cache compression for LLMs, preserving context and improving efficiency, outperforming existing methods by 8.7% in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods fragment context by ignoring semantic relationships between tokens, degrading performance.

Method: ChunkKV treats semantic chunks as compression units, uses layer-wise index reuse, and preserves linguistic structures.

Result: ChunkKV improves throughput by 26.5% and precision by up to 8.7% on benchmarks like LongBench and GSM8K.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware compression with ChunkKV effectively addresses memory bottlenecks in long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing
long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory
during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by
evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic
relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded
performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache
compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as
basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures
and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even
under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index
reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved
indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by
26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench,
Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while
maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that
semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and
performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective
solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

*Xuejiao Zhao, Siyan Liu, Su-Yin Yang, Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedRAG enhances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for EHRs using a knowledge graph (KG) to improve diagnostic accuracy and specificity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heuristic-based RAG models in healthcare lack accuracy and specificity, especially for diseases with similar symptoms.

Method: MedRAG constructs a four-tier hierarchical KG to integrate critical diagnostic differences with retrieved EHRs, reasoning within a large language model.

Result: MedRAG outperforms state-of-the-art models, reducing misdiagnosis rates and providing specific diagnostic insights.

Conclusion: MedRAG's KG-enhanced approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and decision support in healthcare.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for
retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a
key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for
healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and
specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain
are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This
paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited
reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment
recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a
comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical
diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically
integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned
within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific
decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to
enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a
public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD)
collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against
various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the
information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides
more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in
reducing misdiagnosis rates. Our code will be available at

*Yichi Zhang, Siyuan Zhang, Yao Huang, Zeyu Xia, Zhengwei Fang, Xiao Yang, Ranjie Duan, Dong Yan, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STAIR is a novel framework integrating safety alignment with introspective reasoning to mitigate harmful outputs in LLMs while preserving helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods face trade-offs between safety and performance and are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks due to reliance on direct refusals.

Method: STAIR uses self-improving chain-of-thought reasoning and Safety-Informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (SI-MCTS) for iterative preference optimization, training a process reward model for test-time guidance.

Result: STAIR effectively reduces harmful outputs and maintains helpfulness, achieving safety performance comparable to Claude-3.5 against jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: STAIR provides a robust solution for safety alignment in LLMs, balancing safety and performance without compromising utility.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and harmlessness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
become equally critical as their performance in applications. However, existing
safety alignment methods typically suffer from safety-performance trade-offs
and the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, primarily due to their reliance on
direct refusals for malicious queries. In this paper, we propose STAIR, a novel
framework that integrates SafeTy Alignment with Itrospective Reasoning. We
enable LLMs to identify safety risks through step-by-step analysis by
self-improving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with safety awareness. STAIR
first equips the model with a structured reasoning capability and then advances
safety alignment via iterative preference optimization on step-level reasoning
data generated using our newly proposed Safety-Informed Monte Carlo Tree Search
(SI-MCTS). We further train a process reward model on this data to guide
test-time searches for improved responses. Extensive experiments show that
STAIR effectively mitigates harmful outputs while better preserving
helpfulness, compared to instinctive alignment strategies. With test-time
scaling, STAIR achieves a safety performance comparable to Claude-3.5 against
popular jailbreak attacks. Relevant resources in this work are available at

*Yaohua Tang, Zhicheng Hu, Kun Cheng, Fan Mo, Qiheng Lv, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Round Attention, a mechanism to reduce GPU memory usage in LLMs by selectively processing top-k relevant rounds of dialogue, cutting memory usage by 54-82% without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large KV cache storage in GPU memory during prolonged LLM conversations degrades efficiency and availability.

Method: Analyzes dialogue data to identify a watershed layer, then uses Round Attention to process only top-k relevant rounds dynamically.

Result: Reduces memory usage by 54-82% while maintaining answer accuracy.

Conclusion: Round Attention effectively balances memory efficiency and performance in LLM serving systems.

Abstract: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has
improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the
conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV
cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even
availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data
from real users on the granularity of round and discovers that the LLM
inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of
round-level attention shows notable similarity. Based on this, we propose Round
Attention - a novel round-level attention mechanism that selectively processes
the KV cache of top-k relevant rounds, where k is dynamically determined
through the attention matrix in the watershed layer. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method reduces memory usage by 54\% to 82\%, while
experimental results confirm that loading sparse critical-round KV cache
maintains answer accuracy without performance degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in psychotherapy, highlighting current research imbalances and challenges, and suggests future directions for more holistic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP methods fall short in capturing dynamic, context-sensitive interactions needed in psychotherapy, while LLMs show promise due to their contextual and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a conceptual taxonomy dividing psychotherapy into stages (assessment, diagnosis, treatment) to systematically analyze LLM advancements and challenges.

Result: Current research exhibits imbalances like focus on common disorders, linguistic biases, and fragmented methods. Challenges include dynamic symptom tracking and diagnostic reliability.

Conclusion: Future directions include continuous multi-stage modeling, real-time adaptive systems, and diversified research for clinically integrated LLM psychotherapy systems.

Abstract: Mental health is increasingly critical in contemporary healthcare, with
psychotherapy demanding dynamic, context-sensitive interactions that
traditional NLP methods struggle to capture. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
significant potential for addressing this gap due to their ability to handle
extensive context and multi-turn reasoning. This review introduces a conceptual
taxonomy dividing psychotherapy into interconnected stages--assessment,
diagnosis, and treatment--to systematically examine LLM advancements and
challenges. Our comprehensive analysis reveals imbalances in current research,
such as a focus on common disorders, linguistic biases, fragmented methods, and
limited theoretical integration. We identify critical challenges including
capturing dynamic symptom fluctuations, overcoming linguistic and cultural
biases, and ensuring diagnostic reliability. Highlighting future directions, we
advocate for continuous multi-stage modeling, real-time adaptive systems
grounded in psychological theory, and diversified research covering broader
mental disorders and therapeutic approaches, aiming toward more holistic and
clinically integrated psychotherapy LLMs systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' incremental and in-context learning in a text-based environment, testing task-solving, efficiency, and synthetic word inference. Larger models outperform open-weight ones but struggle with synthetic words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in agent systems, focusing on incremental learning, in-context learning, and synthetic word understanding.

Method: Conducted experiments in a text-based environment: incremental task-solving, controlled in-context learning, and synthetic word inference.

Result: Larger commercial models outperform open-weight models but struggle with synthetic word tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in agent systems but face challenges with novel word inference, highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) serve not only as chatbots but as key components
in agent systems, where their common-sense knowledge significantly impacts
performance as language-based planners for situated or embodied action. We
assess LLMs' incremental learning (based on feedback from the environment), and
controlled in-context learning abilities using a text-based environment. We
introduce challenging yet interesting set of experiments to test i) how agents
can incrementally solve tasks related to every day objects in typical rooms in
a house where each of them are discovered by interacting within the
environment, ii) controlled in-context learning abilities and efficiency of
agents by providing short info about locations of objects and rooms to check
how faster the task can be solved, and finally iii) using synthetic
pseudo-English words to gauge how well LLMs are at inferring meaning of unknown
words from environmental feedback. Results show that larger commercial models
have a substantial gap in performance compared to open-weight but almost all
models struggle with the synthetic words experiments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel credit re-assignment strategy, improves performance and generalization in interactive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems struggle with generalization due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies, hindering progress in interactive environments.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, using LLMs for process rewards and synthesized preference data to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors.

Result: Empirical results show improved performance and cross-environment generalizability, with a 7B-parameter system matching or exceeding closed-source models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses generalization challenges and provides insights for using CR rewards and integrating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive
environments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains
beyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in
performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across
environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing
language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good
generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive
environments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment
(CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than
environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in
order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free
agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both
performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems.
Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong
closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights
in using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and
accommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.

*Karl Audun Borgersen, Morten Goodwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether quantization of LLMs using non-English importance matrices affects multilingual performance, finding no significant impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if current quantization practices disproportionately harm multilingual performance when using non-English importance matrices.

Method: Quantizing Llama3.3 70B with importance matrices in English, Norwegian, and Malayalam, then evaluating on the MixEval dataset in English and Norwegian.

Result: Non-significant results show no disproportionate harm to multilingual performance.

Conclusion: Current quantization practices do not negatively impact multilingual performance, even with non-English importance matrices.

Abstract: For consumer usage of locally deployed LLMs, the GGUF format and
k\_quantization are invaluable tools for maintaining the performance of the
original model while reducing it to sizes deployable with consumer-grade
hardware. The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model
is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model
inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an
'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative
of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available
online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open
question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through
the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with
alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by
quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages
(English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset
in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to yielded
non-significant results indicating that current quantization practices do not
disproportionately harm multilingual performance.

*Zhuo Chen, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Xinyu Geng, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Kewei Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to detect the knowledge boundary of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) is proposed, reducing unnecessary retrieval while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs struggle with real-time or knowledge-intensive queries, and indiscriminate use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is costly.

Method: Fine-tune a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification, with two variants.

Result: The method successfully identifies knowledge boundaries, reducing retrieval needs while improving performance on Visual Question Answering datasets.

Conclusion: The identified knowledge boundary can generalize to other VLLMs, offering a cost-effective solution.

Abstract: Despite the advancements made in Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs), like
text Large Language Models (LLMs), they have limitations in addressing
questions that require real-time information or are knowledge-intensive.
Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an
effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their
knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously
maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we
propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more
efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with
two variants that fine-tunes a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for
boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual
Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's
knowledge boundary based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate
retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show
that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used
as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at

TL;DR: TableLoRA improves LLMs' understanding of tabular data by enhancing table serialization and 2D structure representation during parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying PEFT to tabular tasks is challenging due to poor table serialization and 1D sequence limitations.

Method: TableLoRA introduces special tokens for table serialization and 2D LoRA for encoding cell positions.

Result: Outperforms vanilla LoRA and other table encoding methods on four datasets.

Conclusion: TableLoRA is a robust solution for tabular tasks, especially in low-parameter settings.

Abstract: Tabular data are crucial in many fields and their understanding by large
language models (LLMs) under high parameter efficiency paradigm is important.
However, directly applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to
tabular tasks presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of better
table serialization and the representation of two-dimensional structured
information within a one-dimensional sequence. To address this, we propose
TableLoRA, a module designed to improve LLMs' understanding of table structure
during PEFT. It incorporates special tokens for serializing tables with special
token encoder and uses 2D LoRA to encode low-rank information on cell
positions. Experiments on four tabular-related datasets demonstrate that
TableLoRA consistently outperforms vanilla LoRA and surpasses various table
encoding methods tested in control experiments. These findings reveal that
TableLoRA, as a table-specific LoRA, enhances the ability of LLMs to process
tabular data effectively, especially in low-parameter settings, demonstrating
its potential as a robust solution for handling table-related tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RLGDG, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning method for LLMs to improve Game Description Generation (GDG) by enhancing grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately reproducing game features in GDL from natural language remains a challenge, despite previous use of LLMs.

Method: The method combines grammar and concept rewards in a two-stage training strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Result: Experimental results show RLGDG outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone.

Conclusion: RLGDG effectively improves GDG by leveraging reinforcement learning for better grammatical and conceptual accuracy.

Abstract: Game Description Generation (GDG) is the task of generating a game
description written in a Game Description Language (GDL) from natural language
text. Previous studies have explored generation methods leveraging the
contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs); however,
accurately reproducing the game features of the game descriptions remains a
challenge. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning
of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves
grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both
grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training
strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method
significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone. Our code is

TL;DR: A benchmark (MMCR) evaluates VLMs' cross-source reasoning in scientific papers, showing current models struggle, with GPT-4o achieving only 48.55% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of VLMs reasoning across fragmented, heterogeneous sources in scientific papers, a critical step toward AGI.

Method: Creation of the MMCR benchmark with 276 human-annotated questions across 7 subjects and 10 task types, tested on 18 VLMs.

Result: Low accuracy (GPT-4o: 48.55%, Qwen2.5-VL-72B: 39.86%), especially in multi-table tasks (20%). CoT helps larger models but harms smaller ones.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack effective cross-source reasoning, highlighting the need for improved models.

Abstract: Fully comprehending scientific papers by machines reflects a high level of
Artificial General Intelligence, requiring the ability to reason across
fragmented and heterogeneous sources of information, presenting a complex and
practically significant challenge. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly those involving
reasoning with evidence source from single image or text page, their ability to
use cross-source information for reasoning remains an open problem. This work
presents MMCR, a high-difficulty benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' capacity
for reasoning with cross-source information from scientific papers. The
benchmark comprises 276 high-quality questions, meticulously annotated by
humans across 7 subjects and 10 task types. Experiments with 18 VLMs
demonstrate that cross-source reasoning presents a substantial challenge for
existing models. Notably, even the top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved only
48.55% overall accuracy, with only 20% accuracy in multi-table comprehension
tasks, while the second-best model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, reached 39.86% overall
accuracy. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
technique on cross-source reasoning and observed a detrimental effect on small
models, whereas larger models demonstrated substantially enhanced performance.
These results highlight the pressing need to develop VLMs capable of
effectively utilizing cross-source information for reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limited support for non-English languages in VLMs, focusing on German, despite its high-resource status, to evaluate performance disparities.

Method: The analysis disentangles image-related and textual aspects using jury-as-a-judge accuracy tests with German and international images and prompts.

Result: VLMs struggle with German visual cognition for celebrities/sights and fail in German language for animals/plants, but perform equally well for cars and supermarket products in both languages.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for improved multilingual and culturally diverse training in VLMs to enhance performance beyond English-centric datasets.

Abstract: Similar to LLMs, the development of vision language models is mainly driven
by English datasets and models trained in English and Chinese language, whereas
support for other languages, even those considered high-resource languages such
as German, remains significantly weaker. In this work we present an analysis of
open-weight VLMs on factual knowledge in the German and English language. We
disentangle the image-related aspects from the textual ones by analyzing
accu-racy with jury-as-a-judge in both prompt languages and images from German
and international contexts. We found that for celebrities and sights, VLMs
struggle because they are lacking visual cognition of German image contents.
For animals and plants, the tested models can often correctly identify the
image contents ac-cording to the scientific name or English common name but
fail in German lan-guage. Cars and supermarket products were identified equally
well in English and German images across both prompt languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICRT, a novel jailbreak attack framework for LLMs, leveraging human cognitive biases to bypass safety mechanisms and generate harmful content. It also proposes a ranking-based metric for evaluating harmfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak attack methods are limited to brute-force or manual approaches, lacking real-world applicability. The study aims to address this gap by incorporating cognitive heuristics.

Method: ICRT uses cognitive decomposition (simplicity effect) and relevance bias to simplify and reorganize malicious prompts. A ranking-based harmfulness metric (Elo, HodgeRank, Rank Centrality) evaluates outputs.

Result: ICRT successfully bypasses safety mechanisms in mainstream LLMs, generating high-risk content. The ranking metric provides a nuanced evaluation of harmfulness.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in LLMs and offers insights for improving defense strategies against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety
mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual
design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address
this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by
heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we
employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts.
Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing
semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we
introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the
traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation
methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify
the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our
approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates
high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and
contributing to stronger defense strategies.

### [139] [Llama See, Llama Do: A Mechanistic Perspective on Contextual Entrainment and Distraction in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09338)
*Jingcheng Niu, Xingdi Yuan, Tong Wang, Hamidreza Saghir, Amir H. Abdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'contextual entrainment,' a phenomenon where language models (LMs) favor tokens from the input context, regardless of relevance. It identifies 'entrainment heads' as the mechanism behind this and shows how disabling them reduces distraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LMs get distracted by irrelevant context and identify the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon.

Method: The study uses statistical analysis to measure contextual entrainment and a differentiable masking method to discover 'entrainment heads.' It tests counterfactual prompts to assess semantic influence.

Result: LMs exhibit contextual entrainment, favoring context tokens. Semantic factors modulate this effect. Disabling entrainment heads reduces distraction.

Conclusion: The discovery of contextual entrainment and entrainment heads advances mechanistic understanding and offers a way to mitigate LM distraction.

Abstract: We observe a novel phenomenon, contextual entrainment, across a wide range of
language models (LMs) and prompt settings, providing a new mechanistic
perspective on how LMs become distracted by ``irrelevant'' contextual
information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher
logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the
context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual
entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the
relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the
sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of
contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual
prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while
contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic
factors.
  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment
heads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a
novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we
identify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,
i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is
significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates
to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery
of contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via
the entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and
mitigation of the distraction problem.

### [141] [MMBoundary: Advancing MLLM Knowledge Boundary Awareness through Reasoning Step Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23224)
*Zhitao He, Sandeep Polisetty, Zhiyuan Fan, Yuchen Huang, Shujin Wu, Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMBoundary improves multimodal reasoning in MLLMs by calibrating confidence at each reasoning step using textual and cross-modal signals, reducing errors and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of multimodal reasoning in MLLMs, particularly the lack of step-wise confidence assessment leading to hallucination snowballing.

Method: Proposes MMBoundary, a framework combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with self-rewarding signals for step-wise confidence calibration.

Result: Achieves a 7.5% reduction in calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.

Conclusion: MMBoundary effectively enhances MLLM reasoning by improving confidence awareness and self-correction in reasoning chains.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

Result: POLLUX offers a scalable, interpretable tool for evaluating generative LLMs, covering diverse domains and difficulty levels.

Conclusion: POLLUX provides a robust, cost-effective alternative to human evaluations, advancing LLM assessment in Russian.

Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to
evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances
the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of

transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming,
side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained
taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code
generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100
manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized
by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset
entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B)
evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach
provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model
development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating compositional and symbolic properties into distributional semantic spaces to improve Transformer-based LMs, focusing on semantic representation learning to bridge symbolic and distributional semantics. It reviews VAE, VQVAE, and SAE architectures for their latent geometries and semantic interpretability.


<details>

Motivation: To enhance interpretability, controllability, compositionality, and generalization in Transformer-based LMs by combining compositional and symbolic properties with distributional semantics.

Method: Reviews and compares three autoencoder architectures (VAE, VQVAE, SAE) to analyze their latent space geometries and semantic interpretability.

Result: Identifies how each architecture induces distinct latent geometries, impacting semantic structure and interpretability.

Conclusion: Semantic representation learning bridges symbolic and distributional semantics, offering improved LM capabilities through structured latent spaces.

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional
semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability,
compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based
auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel
perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional
semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation
learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional
semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

*Kaixiang Zhang, Justine Zhang, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational framework analyzes talk-time distribution and dynamics in conversations, revealing preferences for balanced talk-time and varied perceptions of dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and understand how talk-time is shared in conversations, including both overall distribution and lower-level dynamics.

Method: Developed a computational framework to analyze talk-time sharing dynamics and applied it to a dataset of video-chats between strangers.

Result: Balanced conversations are preferred, especially by those who talk less. Different dynamics, even with the same balance, are perceived differently.

Conclusion: The framework provides tools for designing better communication platforms, including human-human and human-AI interactions.

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long? In this work we
introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the conversation-level
distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the lower-level dynamics
that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing dynamics structured
by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this framework to a large
dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that, perhaps
unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time are
perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being preferred
over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less. Then we
reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance --
different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by the
participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

TL;DR: SpatialReasoner-R1 improves fine-grained spatial reasoning in VLMs using M3CTS for supervision and fDPO for optimization, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning, especially in multi-step logic and precise alignment.

Method: Uses M3CTS for diverse LongCoT reasoning and fDPO with spatial rewards for optimization.

Result: fDPO improves spatial quality by 4.1% and quantity by 9.0%; SpatialReasoner-R1 sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench.

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1 addresses VLMs' spatial reasoning limitations effectively while maintaining general task performance.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

*Haofeng Wang, Fangtao Zhou, Qi Zhang, Zeyuan Chen, Enci Zhang, Zhao Wang, Xiaofeng Huang, Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pairs is proposed, using a Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM) to improve compression efficiency by leveraging cross-modality information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-IR image pairs are widely used but increase storage and transmission costs, necessitating efficient compression methods.

Method: The framework includes CCEM with Low-frequency Context Extraction Block (LCEB) and Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) to model context probabilities within and between modalities.

Result: The method outperforms existing RGB-IR and single-modality compression techniques, achieving a 23.1% bit rate saving on the LLVIP dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces storage and transmission costs for RGB-IR image pairs by utilizing cross-modality information.

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TanDiT introduces a method for panoramic image generation using tangent-plane grids and a unified diffusion model, addressing distortion and loop-consistency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models struggle with panoramic images due to geometric distortion and loop-consistency requirements.

Method: TanDiT generates tangent-plane images covering 360° views with a unified diffusion model and includes a post-processing step for global coherence.

Result: The method generalizes well, handles complex prompts, and integrates with other models to produce high-quality panoramas.

Conclusion: TanDiT effectively addresses panoramic generation challenges and introduces specialized metrics for evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

*Boyuan Sun, Jiaxing Zhao, Xihan Wei, Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor is a training-free token compression method for video multimodal LLMs, using Semantic Connected Components (SCC) for better semantic coverage and reduced redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods based on attention scores often miss semantic regions and cause redundancy.

Method: Uses SCC to assign tokens to distinct semantic regions, enabling a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy.

Result: Outperforms other methods in video understanding benchmarks, especially at low token retention ratios.

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor effectively compresses tokens while maintaining semantic coverage, improving video understanding performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

*Liangyu Zhong, Fabio Rosenthal, Joachim Sicking, Fabian Hüger, Thorsten Bagdonat, Hanno Gottschalk, Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free visual cropping method for fine-grained VQA, leveraging MLLM-internal representations to efficiently identify relevant image regions, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current visual cropping techniques in fine-grained VQA, such as task-specific fine-tuning, inefficiency, and incompatibility with efficient attention.

Method: FOCUS identifies target objects, computes an object relevance map using KV cache, ranks regions, and performs VQA on the top-ranked region.

Result: Outperforms three visual cropping methods in accuracy and efficiency, matching ZoomEye with 3-6.5x less compute.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an effective, efficient solution for fine-grained VQA without training, leveraging MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

*Aryan Thakre, Omkar Nagwekar, Vedang Talekar, Aparna Santra Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified CAST model using cross-attention to fuse spatial and temporal features for deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose a threat to digital media authenticity, requiring advanced detection techniques that address subtle, time-dependent manipulations. Existing CNN-Transformer models lack deep spatio-temporal interaction.

Method: The CAST model leverages cross-attention to dynamically fuse spatial and temporal features, enhancing detection of fine-grained artifacts like flickering eyes or warped lips.

Result: The model achieves 99.49% AUC and 97.57% accuracy in intra-dataset tests and 93.31% AUC in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: Cross-attention-based feature fusion significantly improves deepfake detection robustness and performance.

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

*Xinghan Wang, Kun Xu, Fei Li, Cao Sheng, Jiazhong Yu, Yadong Mu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for text-driven human motion generation that incorporates human attributes (e.g., age, gender) alongside action semantics, addressing a gap in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion methods overlook human attributes, which significantly influence motion patterns. This work aims to integrate these attributes into motion generation.

Method: A Structural Causal Model-inspired framework decouples action semantics from human attributes, enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled motion generation.

Result: The proposed model generates realistic, attribute-aware motions aligned with text and attribute inputs, validated on the new HumanAttr dataset.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in attribute-aware motion generation, introducing a benchmark dataset and demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

*Xin Lu, Xueyang Fu, Jie Xiao, Zihao Fan, Yurui Zhu, Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new IR framework integrates diffusion training into general IR tasks, improving performance in both single-task and multi-task scenarios through regularization and incremental training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are powerful but complex for IR tasks; integrating their training paradigm into general IR frameworks can enhance performance and practicality.

Method: Systematic analysis of diffusion principles, regularization strategies for alignment with IR tasks, and incremental training with task-specific adaptors.

Result: Improved generalization in single-task IR and superior performance in multi-task unified IR, with seamless integration into existing architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges diffusion training and general IR, offering practical and performance benefits.

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

### [156] [Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation for 3D Self-Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21724)
*Remco F. Leijenaar, Hamidreza Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsymDSD is an Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework for self-supervised 3D point cloud learning, combining masked modeling and invariance learning in latent space, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of learning meaningful 3D point cloud representations without large labeled datasets, and the limitations of reconstruction-based masked point modeling (MPM) in capturing high-level semantics.

Method: Proposes AsymDSD, a framework unifying masked modeling and invariance learning via latent space prediction, featuring asymmetric setup, masked query attention disabling, multi-mask sampling, and multi-crop adaptation.

Result: Achieves 90.53% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, improving to 93.72% with pretraining on 930k shapes, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: AsymDSD effectively addresses the limitations of MPM, demonstrating superior performance in self-supervised 3D point cloud learning.

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

*Yuang Zhang, Jiaxi Gu, Li-Wen Wang, Han Wang, Junqi Cheng, Yuefeng Zhu, Fangyuan Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MimicMotion is a controllable video generation framework that improves quality, smoothness, and length of generated videos using confidence-aware pose guidance, regional loss amplification, and progressive latent fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation lags behind image generation due to challenges like controllability, length, and detail richness, limiting its application.

Method: Proposes confidence-aware pose guidance, regional loss amplification, and progressive latent fusion for high-quality, smooth, and arbitrarily long videos.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements in quality, smoothness, and length over previous methods, validated by experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: MimicMotion advances video generation by addressing key challenges, enabling practical applications with superior performance.

Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has achieved significant
advancements in the field of image generation, spawning a variety of
applications. However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in
various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of
details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In
this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed
MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length
mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our
approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose
guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we
introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which
significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth
videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can
produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With
extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant
improvements over previous approaches in various aspects. Detailed results and
comparisons are available on our project page:

### [158] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao, Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MESP and LCH frameworks to address memorization in generative models, proposing BL-AE and ARVM for improved performance, but highlights memorization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of probabilistic generative models where learning global distributions leads to memorization instead of true generative behavior.

Method: Proposes MESP from VAE analysis, introduces BL-AE for binary latent encoding, and ARVM for histogram output. LCH is introduced to emphasize local correlations for generative capability.

Result: ARVM achieves competitive FID scores but reveals memorization. LCH is validated through experiments.

Conclusion: MESP and LCH provide insights into generative model limitations, with LCH offering a potential solution through local correlations.

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

TL;DR: FedNCA is a lightweight, encryption-ready FL system for medical image segmentation in LMICs, addressing infrastructure and connectivity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL can enable collaborative model training without sharing sensitive data, but LMICs face barriers like limited computing resources and unreliable internet.

Method: FedNCA uses the lightweight Med-NCA architecture for training on low-cost edge devices (e.g., smartphones) and minimizes communication costs.

Result: FedNCA is efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready, making it suitable for compromised networks and resource-constrained regions.

Conclusion: FedNCA fosters equitable healthcare advancements by overcoming infrastructural and security challenges in LMICs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

*Sirnam Swetha, Rohit Gupta, Parth Parag Kulkarni, David G Shatwell, Jeffrey A Chan Santiago, Nyle Siddiqui, Joseph Fioresi, Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ImplicitQA, a benchmark for testing implicit reasoning in VideoQA, addressing gaps in current benchmarks that focus on explicit visual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA benchmarks lack challenges requiring implicit reasoning (e.g., motives, causality), which humans excel at. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors created ImplicitQA, a dataset of 1K QA pairs from 320+ creative video clips, annotated for key reasoning dimensions like causality and social interactions.

Result: Evaluations show leading VideoQA models struggle with implicit reasoning, highlighting their reliance on surface-level cues.

Conclusion: ImplicitQA aims to advance research in VideoQA by addressing implicit reasoning challenges, with the dataset and framework released for community use.

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively capture all sound events in a video, inspired by traditional Foley workflows and compositional generation frameworks.

Method: Step-by-step generation of audio tracks conditioned on text prompts and prior tracks, using pre-trained models without specialized datasets.

Result: Generates multiple distinct audio tracks per video, achieving higher-quality composite audio than existing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively synthesizes high-quality composite audio by leveraging guided generation and accessible training data.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

Conclusion: The pipeline is reproducible, scalable, and clinically promising for early glaucoma detection.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single

Motivation: To assess and improve computer vision techniques for understanding egocentric video data, addressing their underperformance compared to third-person videos.

Method: Evaluated Shotluck Holmes (supervised), TAC-SUM (unsupervised), and GPT-4o (prompt fine-tuned) on Ego-Exo4D dataset for video summarization.

Result: GPT-4o outperformed specialized models, revealing limitations of current methods in handling first-person perspectives.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for advancements in egocentric video analysis and suggests potential in prompt fine-tuning for this domain.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to

Result: CatSGG outperforms existing methods in generating structured surgical representations, enhancing phase and technique recognition.

Conclusion: CAT-SG and CatSGG advance AI-driven surgical training, decision support, and workflow analysis, enabling context-aware clinical systems.

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue

incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on Siegfried and ICDAR 2021 datasets, with significant improvements in low-data scenarios (5- and 10-shot).

Conclusion: The method enables precise segmentation with reduced manual annotation, advancing automated historical map analysis.

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the

TL;DR: ReF-LLE is a personalized low-light image enhancement method using Fourier frequency domain and deep reinforcement learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like varying low-light conditions and subjective enhancement preferences.

Method: Integrates deep reinforcement learning with a zero-reference image evaluation strategy for training and a personalized adaptive iterative strategy for inference.

Result: Superior perceptual quality and adaptability in personalized enhancement, validated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ReF-LLE effectively handles diverse low-light conditions and user preferences, setting a new standard in the field.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Method: TaleForge uses three modules: Story Generation (LLMs create narratives), Personalized Image Generation (user faces/outfits in illustrations), and Background Generation (scene backdrops with personalized characters).

Result: A user study showed increased engagement and ownership when users appeared as protagonists. Participants liked real-time previews but wanted better narrative editing tools.

Conclusion: TaleForge advances multimodal storytelling by combining personalized text and imagery for immersive, user-centric experiences.

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inpainting models in medical imaging, like polyps, can produce inaccurate results, risking diagnosis errors. Expert annotations and human feedback are needed for reliable training.

Method: PrefPaint incorporates human feedback directly into Stable Diffusion Inpainting training, avoiding expensive reward models. A web interface facilitates feedback and fine-tuning.

Result: PrefPaint reduces visual inconsistencies and enhances image realism, particularly in medical polyps imaging, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: PrefPaint offers a reliable, user-friendly solution for medical inpainting, leveraging human feedback to improve accuracy and realism in critical applications.

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSAM improves visual reference segmentation by using a variational prompt encoder to avoid unstable prompt regions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods for visual reference segmentation generate prompts at object boundaries, causing instability and reduced robustness.

Method: ProSAM introduces a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, avoiding unstable regions.

Result: ProSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets.

Conclusion: ProSAM provides a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation by addressing prompt instability.

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models often fail at spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, which are critical for creating solvable and visually coherent escape room puzzles.

Method: The proposed framework uses specialized agents in stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing, with iterative feedback for collaboration.

Result: Agent collaboration enhances output quality, improving solvability, avoiding shortcuts, and clarifying affordances while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: The hierarchical multi-agent approach effectively addresses the limitations of base models for generating high-quality escape room puzzle images.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images
that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating.
While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses error-bias in face alignment by proposing ADL and AAM for improved CNN convergence, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error-bias in facial landmark distributions along tangent lines is overlooked but significant for ambiguous labeling tasks.

Method: Proposes Anisotropic Direction Loss (ADL) for coordinate regression and Anisotropic Attention Module (AAM) for heatmap regression.

Result: ADNet, integrating ADL and AAM, achieves top performance on 300W, WFLW, and COFW datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively leverage error-bias for better face alignment, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Method: Uses a hybrid training strategy (cross-attention, contrastive, self-supervised learning) and stable diffusion with Variational Score Distillation.

Result: Successfully generates 3D objects from EEG data, matching content and structure.

Conclusion: The approach advances EEG-based 3D reconstruction, enhancing BCI potential.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

*Yangyu Huang, Xi Chen, Jongyoo Kim, Hao Yang, Chong Li, Jiaolong Yang, Dong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for dense face alignment using sparse landmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense facial landmarks are needed in applications like cosmetic medicine, but most methods only handle sparse alignment.

Method: Uses weakly-supervised learning to refine sparse landmarks and adapt to dense ones, with custom operators.

Result: Achieves top accuracy in dense and sparse testsets (300W, WFLW) without additional cost.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enriches landmark density and improves alignment accuracy.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

*Jiho Choi, Sang Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised method learns periodic signal representations from facial videos for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), improving cross-dataset performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture subtle skin tone changes for rPPG estimation, leveraging unlabeled facial videos.

Method: Uses a video masked autoencoder with frame masking and physiological bandlimit constraints for self-supervised learning.

Result: Significant performance improvements in cross-dataset evaluations on PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and V4V datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns periodic signals for rPPG, demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores the link between Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Saliency Prediction, showing IQA incorporates saliency knowledge. It introduces the SACID dataset and compares IQA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep neural models succeed in IQA and to investigate the role of saliency in human perception.

Method: Empirical study linking IQA and Saliency Prediction, creation of the SACID dataset, and comparison of IQA methods.

Result: Demonstrates that IQA incorporates saliency knowledge and provides a new dataset for evaluation.

Conclusion: Saliency is crucial for IQA, and the SACID dataset aids in evaluating IQA methods.

Abstract: Over the past few years, deep neural models have made considerable advances
in image quality assessment (IQA). However, the underlying reasons for their
success remain unclear, owing to the complex nature of deep neural networks.
IQA aims to describe how the human visual system (HVS) works and to create its
efficient approximations. On the other hand, Saliency Prediction task aims to
emulate HVS via determining areas of visual interest. Thus, we believe that
saliency plays a crucial role in human perception. In this work, we conduct an
empirical study that reveals the relation between IQA and Saliency Prediction
tasks, demonstrating that the former incorporates knowledge of the latter.
Moreover, we introduce a novel SACID dataset of saliency-aware compressed
images and conduct a large-scale comparison of classic and neural-based IQA
methods. All supplementary code and data will be available at the time of
publication.

Result: Pre-trained on HEST-1k, SPADE shows superior few-shot performance on 14 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating morphological and molecular data into a unified latent space enhances performance in pathology tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Motivation: Current MLLMs lack proficiency in geologic map understanding due to challenges like cartographic generalization and domain-specific knowledge requirements.

Method: Developed GeoMap-Bench for evaluation and GeoMap-Agent with HIE, DKI, and PEQA modules, leveraging AI expert groups for interdisciplinary analysis.

Result: GeoMap-Agent scored 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, outperforming GPT-4o (0.369).

Conclusion: The work (PEACE) advances AI applications in geology, improving efficiency and accuracy in geological investigations.

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts
as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze
questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall

*Ao-Xiang Zhang, Yuan-Gen Wang, Yu Ran, Weixuan Tang, Qingxiao Guan, Chunsheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SecureVQA, a secure Video Quality Assessment framework resistant to adversarial attacks, combining intra-frame and inter-frame defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in video traffic and vulnerability of current VQA models to adversarial attacks necessitate a secure VQA solution.

Method: Proposes SecureVQA with random spatial grid sampling for intra-frame defense, pixel-wise randomization via a guardian map, and temporal information extraction for inter-frame defense.

Result: SecureVQA achieves competitive VQA performance and sets a new security benchmark, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: SecureVQA successfully enhances VQA model security while maintaining performance, with principles generalizable to leading models.

Abstract: The exponential surge in video traffic has intensified the imperative for
Video Quality Assessment (VQA). Leveraging cutting-edge architectures, current
VQA models have achieved human-comparable accuracy. However, recent studies
have revealed the vulnerability of existing VQA models against adversarial
attacks. To establish a reliable and practical assessment system, a secure VQA
model capable of resisting such malicious attacks is urgently demanded.
Unfortunately, no attempt has been made to explore this issue. This paper first
attempts to investigate general adversarial defense principles, aiming at
endowing existing VQA models with security. Specifically, we first introduce
random spatial grid sampling on the video frame for intra-frame defense. Then,
we design pixel-wise randomization through a guardian map, globally
neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we extract temporal
information from the video sequence as compensation for inter-frame defense.
Building upon these principles, we present a novel VQA framework from the
security-oriented perspective, termed SecureVQA. Extensive experiments indicate
that SecureVQA sets a new benchmark in security while achieving competitive VQA
performance compared with state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies delve
deeper into analyzing the principles of SecureVQA, demonstrating their
generalization and contributions to the security of leading VQA models.

*Sungjune Park, Yeongyun Kim, Se Yeon Kim, Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LVLM framework for remote sensing (RS) addresses domain gaps by using Semantic-augmented Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling to enhance RS scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with RS imagery due to domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics, limiting their direct application.

Method: The framework includes a retrieval-based Semantic Augmentation Module for multi-level feature alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling for hierarchical semantic understanding.

Result: The proposed framework improves performance across RS tasks like scene classification and VQA, demonstrating effectiveness in bridging the gap between general LVLMs and RS-specific needs.

Conclusion: The tailored LVLM framework successfully addresses RS domain challenges, enabling better vision-language understanding in RS applications.

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

*Yanguang Sun, Jiexi Yan, Jianjun Qian, Chunyan Xu, Jian Yang, Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) is proposed to integrate convolutional and Transformer features for better segmentation in optical remote sensing images, addressing challenges like feature heterogeneity and model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for segmenting optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) often overlook the challenges of integrating convolutional and Transformer features, leading to sub-optimal results.

Method: DPU-Former uses global-local mixed attention, a Fourier-space merging strategy, and a gated linear feed-forward network to efficiently fuse features and enhance expressive ability. A specialized decoder aggregates and strengthens features.

Result: DPU-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DPU-Former effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering improved segmentation performance by unifying long-range dependencies and spatial details.

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RRSHID, a real-world dataset for remote sensing image dehazing (RSID), and MCAF-Net, a novel framework with three innovative components for robust dehazing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RSID methods rely on synthetic datasets, which struggle with real-world applications due to domain gaps. The lack of real-world datasets limits progress.

Method: Proposes MCAF-Net with three components: MFIBA for feature extraction, CSAM for color distortion mitigation, and MFAFM for feature fusion.

Result: MCAF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world RSID and maintains competitiveness on synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: RRSHID and MCAF-Net set new benchmarks for real-world RSID, offering practical solutions and publicly available resources.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Dehazing (RSID) poses significant challenges in
real-world scenarios due to the complex atmospheric conditions and severe color
distortions that degrade image quality. The scarcity of real-world remote
sensing hazy image pairs has compelled existing methods to rely primarily on
synthetic datasets. However, these methods struggle with real-world
applications due to the inherent domain gap between synthetic and real data. To
address this, we introduce Real-World Remote Sensing Hazy Image Dataset
(RRSHID), the first large-scale dataset featuring real-world hazy and dehazed
image pairs across diverse atmospheric conditions. Based on this, we propose
MCAF-Net, a novel framework tailored for real-world RSID. Its effectiveness
arises from three innovative components: Multi-branch Feature Integration Block
Aggregator (MFIBA), which enables robust feature extraction through cascaded
integration blocks and parallel multi-branch processing; Color-Calibrated
Self-Supervised Attention Module (CSAM), which mitigates complex color
distortions via self-supervised learning and attention-guided refinement; and
Multi-Scale Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (MFAFM), which integrates features
effectively while preserving local details and global context. Extensive
experiments validate that MCAF-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
real-world RSID, while maintaining competitive performance on synthetic
datasets. The introduction of RRSHID and MCAF-Net sets new benchmarks for
real-world RSID research, advancing practical solutions for this complex task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the performance drop in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to token pruning, proposing Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP) to recover accuracy by adjusting position IDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token pruning in MLLMs reduces computational costs but weakens grounding ability, causing significant accuracy drops in tasks like Referring Expression Comprehension (REC).

Method: Proposes GAP, a method to adjust position IDs after pruning, ensuring alignment without extra training or computational overhead.

Result: GAP recovers REC accuracy to 51.42% (90% of original performance) and improves performance across models like Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and LLaVA.

Conclusion: GAP effectively mitigates the negative impact of token pruning on grounding tasks, offering a simple and efficient solution.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

TL;DR: A framework using gradient-based interpretability to flag problematic training images improves psoriasis severity scoring model performance by 5% AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-rater variability and data collection challenges (lighting, background, device quality) hinder reliable automated psoriasis severity scoring.

Method: Gradient-based interpretability traces misclassified validation images to detect training samples with annotation inconsistencies or nonclinical artifacts. Applied to a ConvNeXT-based weakly supervised model.

Result: Removing 8.2% of flagged images improved model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%). The method identified 90% of inter-rater disagreements by reviewing only 30% of samples.

Conclusion: The framework enhances automated scoring robustness, reducing reliance on manual annotation review and improving reliability for remote assessments.

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses OOD detection in point cloud objects using 3D VLMs, proposing SODA to mitigate synthetic-to-real domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection in point clouds is critical for model safety but under-explored. Synthetic-to-real domain shift in 3D VLMs hinders performance.

Method: Proposes SODA, a neighborhood-based score propagation scheme for OOD detection without additional training.

Result: SODA achieves state-of-the-art performance across datasets and settings.

Conclusion: SODA effectively improves OOD detection in point clouds by addressing domain shift in 3D VLMs.

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

*Fangling Jiang, Qi Li, Weining Wang, Gang Wang, Bing Liu, Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method is proposed, leveraging multimodal large language models to improve generalization and interpretability without memorizing data patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor generalization and limited interpretability in existing face anti-spoofing methods due to memorization of training data patterns.

Method: Uses verifiable class and reasoning consistent rewards with GRPO-based optimization to guide reasoning policy exploration. Iterative trial-and-error learning distills generalizable rules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization, handling diverse unknown attacks in unseen domains with interpretable reasoning.

Conclusion: The method effectively solves cross-domain face anti-spoofing with high generalizability and interpretability, avoiding labor-intensive annotations.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive

*Dipayan Biswas, Shishir Shah, Jaspal Subhlok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transfer learning approach using YOLO for detecting visual elements in lecture videos, addressing challenges like lack of standard structure and clear boundaries. It includes a benchmark dataset and source code for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual elements in lecture videos are crucial for comprehension but are hard to detect automatically due to their unique nature and lack of annotated datasets.

Method: A transfer learning approach using YOLO, optimized with training on benchmark datasets and a semi-supervised auto-labeling strategy.

Result: YOLO emerged as the most effective model, with successful detection of visual elements in lecture videos.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general solution for object detection in lecture videos, supported by a publicly released benchmark dataset and source code.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Motivation: FGVC is challenging due to subtle class differences and fragile features, especially with scarce labeled data.

Method: Combines Mamba-based feature modeling, region attention, and Bayesian uncertainty for robust learning.

Result: Strong performance on FGVC benchmarks, especially with occlusions and limited labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances feature modeling and pseudo-label quality, proving effective for FGVC with scarce labels.

Abstract: Fine Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) remains a challenging task in
computer vision due to subtle inter class differences and fragile feature
representations. Existing methods struggle in fine grained scenarios,
especially when labeled data is scarce. We propose a semi supervised method
combining Mamba based feature modeling, region attention, and Bayesian
uncertainty. Our approach enhances local to global feature modeling while
focusing on key areas during learning. Bayesian inference selects high quality
pseudo labels for stability. Experiments show strong performance on FGVC
benchmarks with occlusions, demonstrating robustness when labeled data is

*Nam Quan Nguyen, Xuan Phong Pham, Tuan-Anh Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SepFormer is a DETR-style model for Table Structure Recognition (TSR) that improves speed and robustness by integrating split-and-merge into a single step via separator regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated reconstruction of table structures from images is crucial for semantic data extraction, but existing methods lack efficiency and robustness.

Method: SepFormer uses a coarse-to-fine approach with two transformer decoders to predict separators, refining from single-line to line-strip segments.

Result: Achieves 25.6 FPS with comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like SciTSR and PubTabNet.

Conclusion: SepFormer offers a fast and robust solution for TSR, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

TL;DR: ZeroReg3D is a zero-shot registration pipeline for accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D histological sections, addressing challenges like tissue deformation and artifacts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D registration methods fail to preserve 3D spatial relationships, limiting clinical and research utility due to issues like tissue deformation and imaging variability.

Method: ZeroReg3D combines zero-shot deep learning keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration techniques.

Result: The method effectively handles tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent illumination without needing retraining.

Conclusion: ZeroReg3D offers a robust solution for 3D histological reconstruction, balancing accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAZER combines 3D and 2D reasoning for zero-shot 3D visual grounding, outperforming prior methods by 9.0-10.9% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing zero-shot 3DVG methods that focus on either spatial or semantic understanding, SPAZER integrates both for robust performance.

Method: SPAZER uses a progressive framework: 3D rendering from optimal viewpoints, anchor-guided candidate screening, and 3D-2D joint decision-making.

Result: Achieves significant accuracy gains (9.0% and 10.9%) on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPAZER effectively bridges spatial and semantic reasoning, enabling robust zero-shot 3DVG without 3D-labeled training data.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses quality assessment and optimization of AI-generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) for VR/AR, introducing a database (OHF2024) and two models (BLIP2OIQA, BLIP2OISal) for quality evaluation and saliency prediction, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of research on quality assessment and optimization for AIGODIs, despite their potential in VR/AR applications, drives this work.

Method: Established the OHF2024 database with subjective ratings and saliency data, then proposed BLIP2OIQA and BLIP2OISal models for quality evaluation and saliency prediction, followed by an optimization process.

Result: The models achieve SOTA performance in quality evaluation and saliency prediction, and the optimization process enhances AIGODI visual quality.

Conclusion: The work provides tools (database, models) for AIGODI quality research and demonstrates their effectiveness in optimization, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

### [194] [SDRNET: Stacked Deep Residual Network for Accurate Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21945)
*Naftaly Wambugu, Ruisheng Wang, Bo Guo, Tianshu Yu, Sheng Xu, Mohammed Elhassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a stacked deep residual network (SDRNet) for accurate semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed (FRRS) images, addressing challenges like class disparities and object size variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate semantic segmentation of FRRS images is hindered by class disparities, occlusion, and object size variation, despite advancements in deep learning.

Method: The SDRNet uses two stacked encoder-decoder networks and dilated residual blocks (DRB) to capture long-range semantics and preserve spatial details.

Result: Experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets show SDRNet outperforms current deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs).

Conclusion: SDRNet effectively addresses segmentation challenges in FRRS images, offering competitive performance against existing methods.

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

*Yixin Zha, Chuxin Wang, Wenfei Yang, Tianzhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Masked Autoencoder, a method to improve point cloud understanding by addressing limitations of random masking in self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking strategies in pre-training methods fail to capture semantic relationships in point clouds, limiting model performance.

Method: Proposes a Semantic Masked Autoencoder with a prototype-based semantic modeling module and a semantic-enhanced masking strategy.

Result: Experiments on ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart show the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances semantic understanding and performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASeg is a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework using LoRA fine-tuning and CLIP embeddings to improve semantic segmentation by addressing modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-T models lack high-level textual information and struggle with similar visual categories, while SAM's integration with thermal images and text is hindered by modality issues.

Method: Proposes TASeg with a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) for merging visual modalities and CLIP text embeddings for semantic alignment, while freezing SAM's transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves superior performance in challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: TASeg effectively addresses segmentation challenges by combining visual and textual features, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

*Biao Wang, Wenwen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces R1-Track, a fine-tuned version of Qwen2.5-VL for visual tracking using GRPO reinforcement learning, achieving strong results on GOT-10k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tracking methods lack flexibility and require large datasets. The rise of MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL inspired exploring their use for tracking, despite initial limitations.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL with GRPO reinforcement learning on a small dataset using rule-based rewards.

Result: R1-Track performed well on GOT-10k, supporting flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text.

Conclusion: R1-Track shows promise, with potential for further improvements, as of May 2025.

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for generating long-horizon videos for robotic tasks avoids autoregressive generation by decomposing goals into atomic tasks, interpolating keyframes, and using a semantics-preserving attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks due to error accumulation in autoregressive approaches.

Method: 1) Decompose goals into atomic tasks and generate keyframes. 2) Interpolate between keyframes. 3) Use a semantics-preserving attention module and lightweight policy model.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on video quality, consistency, and outperforming previous policy models on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses limitations of autoregressive generation for long-horizon robotic videos.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETP improves pruning efficiency in DNNs by using exponential force regularization, outperforming prior methods in compression and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in existing pruning techniques, which result in dense networks and accuracy drops.

Method: Proposes Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), applying exponential force to regularize and prune distant neural modules.

Result: ETP achieves higher compression rates with minimal accuracy loss across various domains.

Conclusion: ETP is a simple yet effective solution for efficient DNN pruning.

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

TL;DR: A facial stylization method improves content consistency and stylization quality by integrating semantic preservation and pseudo-paired supervision, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing artifacts and fidelity issues in StyleGAN-based facial stylization by focusing on semantic shifts and content preservation.

Method: Proposes semantic preservation constraints and pseudo-paired supervision, along with multi-level pseudo-paired dataset creation for better stylization.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style transfer, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: The method enhances stylization quality and flexibility, enabling multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex designs.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the HOSS ReID dataset for ship tracking using hybrid optical and SAR sensors, addressing limitations of current methods, and proposes the TransOSS baseline method for cross-modal re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ship tracking methods rely on geostationary or video satellites, which have limitations like low resolution, weather susceptibility, short filming durations, and limited coverage. The paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: The authors present the HOSS ReID dataset for evaluating ship tracking with low-Earth orbit constellations of optical and SAR sensors. They also propose TransOSS, a Vision Transformer-based method for cross-modal ship re-identification, incorporating contrastive learning and refined patch embeddings.

Result: The HOSS ReID dataset enables all-weather tracking with shorter re-imaging cycles. TransOSS demonstrates the ability to extract modality-invariant features for cross-modal ship re-identification.

Conclusion: The HOSS ReID dataset and TransOSS method provide a robust solution for ship tracking, addressing the limitations of existing methods and enabling practical applications in maritime monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs

*Jialei Chen, Xu Zheng, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool, Hiroshi Murase, Daisuke Deguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chimera-Seg and Selective Global Distillation (SGD) improve zero-shot semantic segmentation by aligning vision-language models with segmentation tasks, achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in aligning vision-based features with textual space and bridging the semantic gap between global and local features in zero-shot semantic segmentation.

Method: Propose Chimera-Seg, integrating a segmentation backbone with a CLIP-based semantic head, and SGD for selective knowledge distillation. Also, use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) for further alignment.

Result: Experiments show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in hIoU on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg and SGD effectively enhance zero-shot semantic segmentation by combining spatial precision with vision-language alignment.

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

*Hong Nie, Fuyuan Cao, Lu Chen, Fengxin Chen, Yuefeng Zou, Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIAG is a 3D talking head synthesis framework enabling efficient identity-specific adaptation with minimal training data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of reconstruction and rendering-based methods, which require identity-specific training and lack scalability.

Method: Uses Global Gaussian Field for multi-identity representation and Universal Motion Field for common motion dynamics, enabling rapid adaptation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in comparative and ablation experiments.

Conclusion: FIAG is effective and generalizable for efficient identity-specific adaptation in talking head synthesis.

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

*Durgesh K. Singh, Ahcene Boubekki, Qing Cao, Svein Arne Aase, Robert Jenssen, Michael Kampffmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves LV measurement accuracy in echocardiography by enforcing straight-line constraints and using AMM images, reducing errors and simplifying user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual landmark placement in LV measurements is time-consuming and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks, leading to inaccurate results.

Method: The framework trains a landmark detector on AMM images derived from B-mode videos, transforms them back to B-mode space, and enforces straight-line constraints to improve alignment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate enhanced accuracy over standard B-mode methods and good generalization across network architectures.

Conclusion: The semi-automatic framework, with a human-in-the-loop step, simplifies interaction while maintaining clinical relevance and alignment flexibility.

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MirrorMe is a real-time, controllable framework for audio-driven portrait animation, addressing latency and temporal consistency issues in diffusion-based methods with innovations like identity injection, causal audio encoding, and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in real-time generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations from audio signals motivate the development of MirrorMe.

Method: MirrorMe uses the LTX video model with innovations: reference identity injection, causal audio encoder/adapter, and progressive training for gesture control.

Result: MirrorMe achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability on the EMTD Benchmark.

Conclusion: MirrorMe successfully addresses latency and consistency issues in audio-driven portrait animation, offering high-quality real-time synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

*Petr Hruby, Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating relative pose in rolling shutter cameras using line projections and scanlines, enabling motion-independent pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify rolling shutter camera pose estimation without requiring explicit motion modeling, facilitating structure-from-motion (SfM) applications.

Method: Uses intersections of line projections with scanlines, minimal solvers for generic and specialized cases (e.g., parallel lines, known gravity), and leverages 2D structure estimation from 1D cameras.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility for initializing rolling shutter SfM on the Fastec dataset, with potential for further development.

Conclusion: The approach is a foundational step for rolling shutter SfM, offering motion-independent pose estimation and promising scalability.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

*Shaheer U. Saeed, Yipei Wang, Veeru Kasivisvanathan, Brian R. Davidson, Matthew J. Clarkson, Yipeng Hu, Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel learning paradigm enables machine reasoning in vision tasks by improving performance with increased thinking time, even with limited labeled data, outperforming supervised learning and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machines lack dynamic reasoning abilities like humans, especially in non-verbal domains such as vision and medical diagnosis.

Method: Combines fast-thinking (System I) and slow-thinking (System II) modules, inspired by dual-process human cognition, using self-play reinforcement learning for iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms large-scale supervised learning, foundation models, and human experts in vision tasks and cancer localization.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates transformative potential for non-verbal machine reasoning, bridging a critical gap in AI capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

### [208] [Towards Accurate Heart Rate Measurement from Ultra-Short Video Clips via Periodicity-Guided rPPG Estimation and Signal Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22078)
*Pei-Kai Huanga, Ya-Ting Chan, Kuan-Wen Chen, Yen-Chun Chou, Shih-Yu Yang, Chiou-Ting Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to accurately measure heart rate (HR) from ultra-short 2-second video clips by addressing periodicity and spectral leakage challenges, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HR measurement methods often overlook ultra-short video clips (e.g., 2 seconds), focusing instead on longer clips (~10 seconds). This paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: The method includes a periodicity-guided rPPG estimation to ensure consistency with longer ground truth signals and a generator to reconstruct longer rPPG signals from ultra-short ones, reducing spectral leakage.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show the method accurately measures HR from ultra-short clips and outperforms previous rPPG techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in HR estimation from ultra-short video clips, addressing key challenges effectively.

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

*Zipei Ma, Junzhe Jiang, Yurui Chen, Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BézierGS uses learnable Bézier curves for dynamic object motion, improving scene reconstruction without relying on high-precision annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on object pose annotations, limiting large-scale scene reconstruction. BézierGS aims to overcome this by leveraging temporal information and learnable curves.

Method: BézierGS models motion trajectories with Bézier curves, introduces rendering supervision, and enforces inter-curve consistency for accurate scene separation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic/static scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis on Waymo and nuPlan datasets.

Conclusion: BézierGS offers a scalable solution for realistic street scene reconstruction by reducing annotation dependency and improving accuracy.

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

*Hyeongji Kim, Stine Hansen, Michael Kampffmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPM improves medical image few-shot segmentation by addressing ADNet's limitations with tied prototypes, multi-class support, and adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADNet's limitations include single prototypes, binary focus, and fixed thresholds, hindering adaptability in medical image segmentation.

Method: TPM introduces tied prototype locations, extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class segmentation, and uses adaptive thresholds.

Result: TPM achieves improved segmentation accuracy and better handles background variability.

Conclusion: TPM offers a novel approach to prototype-based few-shot segmentation for medical images, enhancing performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Indian driving pedestrian dataset to improve pedestrian behavior prediction in unstructured environments, highlighting its challenges and outperforming standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian behavior prediction is crucial for autonomous driving safety, especially in complex, unpredictable conditions. Existing datasets lack coverage of unstructured environments.

Method: The authors introduce a new dataset with detailed annotations for pedestrian behavior in unstructured settings, evaluating state-of-the-art prediction methods.

Result: Performance drops by 15% for intention prediction and increases MSE by 1208 for trajectory prediction compared to standard datasets.

Conclusion: The dataset presents new challenges for robust pedestrian behavior modeling, encouraging further research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pipe modeling from laser scans is time-consuming and labor-intensive, necessitating automation for efficient digital twin creation.

Method: Estimates skeleton curves with Laplacian-based contraction, elongates curves, recenters axes using rolling spheres and 2D circle fitting, and refines with 3D smoothing.

Result: Enables accurate determination of pipe properties (radius, length, orientation) and creation of detailed 3D pipe network models.

Conclusion: Automation reduces costs and accelerates digital twin development by providing rapid, precise pipe reconstruction.

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CP-INR, a CP-based low-rank tensor function for implicit neural representation, addressing sparsity and smoothness challenges with theoretical guarantees and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in multi-dimensional data tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods like Tucker and CP lack either flexibility or sparsity. The paper aims to combine CP's interpretability with neural networks for continuous data representation.

Method: CP-INR uses neural networks for implicit representation, introduces a variational Schatten-p quasi-norm for sparsity, and proposes a spectral norm-based regularization for smoothness.

Result: The method excels in tasks like image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: CP-INR effectively balances interpretability, sparsity, and smoothness, offering a versatile solution for multi-dimensional data recovery.

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-LLMs struggle with capturing crucial spatiotemporal clues due to uniform frame sampling and computational limits.

Method: Q-Frame uses a training-free, plug-and-play strategy with CLIP for text-image matching and Gumbel-Max trick for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling.

Result: Q-Frame outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (MLVU, LongVideoBench, Video-MME), preserving critical spatiotemporal information.

Conclusion: Q-Frame enhances Video-LLMs' video comprehension by efficiently processing frames without exceeding computational limits, proving its superiority and broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the binding problem in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by augmenting visual inputs with spatial structures and textual prompts, leading to significant performance improvements in visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with the binding problem, failing to reliably associate perceptual features with correct visual referents, which limits performance in tasks like counting, visual search, and spatial reasoning.

Method: The study introduces low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) paired with textual prompts to encourage sequential, spatially-aware parsing.

Result: The method improves GPT-4o's visual search accuracy by 25.00%, counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces scene description errors by 0.32, and enhances spatial relationship task performance by 9.50%.

Conclusion: Visual input design, particularly low-level spatial structuring, is crucial for improving VLMs' compositional visual reasoning, outperforming purely linguistic approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

*Ronald Fecso, José Morano, Ursula Schmidt-Erfurth, Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetFiner is an SSL vision-language refinement scheme that enhances existing foundation models for OCT imaging, improving downstream performance without costly supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for OCT lack robust semantic understanding and require supervised fine-tuning, which is often impractical.

Method: RetFiner uses diverse training objectives leveraging textual data to refine foundation models like RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM.

Result: RetFiner significantly improves performance on seven OCT classification tasks, with average gains of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1 percentage points over baselines.

Conclusion: RetFiner offers an efficient way to adapt foundation models for specific populations and tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly

### [217] [Attention-disentangled Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space Optimization for Few-shot Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22161)
*Taijin Zhao, Heqian Qiu, Yu Dai, Lanxiao Wang, Fanman Meng, Qingbo Wu, Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) framework for few-shot object detection (FSOD), addressing limitations of entangled feature spaces in existing methods. It introduces Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) and Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSOD methods, based on Faster R-CNN, suffer from entangled feature spaces, leading to class-specific objectness criteria and poor performance on novel classes due to unrepresentative samples.

Method: UOFS decouples feature space into orthogonal components (magnitude for objectness, angle for classification). HBO addresses challenges of unlabeled instances and angular overfitting. SADA resolves task conflicts.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches by enabling better transfer of objectness knowledge and improving angular distribution uniformity.

Conclusion: UOFS with HBO and SADA effectively resolves feature entanglement, enhancing FSOD performance for novel classes.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

*Wenhan Wu, Zhishuai Guo, Chen Chen, Hongfei Xue, Aidong Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FS-VAE, a model for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, enhancing semantic representation with frequency decomposition and multilevel alignment to improve robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook fine-grained action patterns in semantic space, limiting zero-shot recognition. FS-VAE addresses this by integrating frequency and semantic enhancements.

Method: FS-VAE includes: 1) frequency-based enhancement, 2) multilevel semantic alignment, and 3) calibrated cross-alignment loss to bridge gaps and improve robustness.

Result: Benchmark evaluations show FS-VAE effectively differentiates similar actions, enhancing zero-shot recognition.

Conclusion: FS-VAE's frequency-enhanced semantic features improve zero-shot action recognition by addressing semantic gaps and ambiguities.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

*Yuxin Cui, Rui Song, Yibin Li, Max Q. -H. Meng, Zhe Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage multi-view 2D/3D registration method improves accuracy and robustness by leveraging cross-view constraints and test-time optimization, achieving superior performance on the DeepFluoro dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate alignment of preoperative models with intraoperative images is critical for interventional navigation, but limited field of view in single-image scenarios necessitates multi-view approaches.

Method: The method involves a two-stage process: (1) a combined loss function with cross-view constraints for pose and image dissimilarities, and (2) test-time optimization to refine poses.

Result: Achieves a mean target registration error (mTRE) of 0.79 ± 2.17 mm on the DeepFluoro dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances registration robustness and accuracy, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quantum gate perturbations, often seen as harmful, can enhance machine learning by acting as data augmentation. The paper explores Bloch sphere rotations for quantum-inspired augmentation, showing improved image classification performance on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether small quantum gate perturbations, typically considered detrimental, can benefit machine learning by serving as a natural data augmentation method.

Method: The study applies random Bloch sphere rotations (SU(2) transformations) as a quantum-inspired augmentation technique to classical data, specifically testing on the ImageNet dataset.

Result: Quantum-inspired augmentation improved Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to classical methods. Stronger unitary augmentations, while preserving information, did not enhance differential privacy.

Conclusion: Small-angle Bloch rotations are effective for quantum-inspired data augmentation, boosting classical machine learning performance, but they do not improve differential privacy.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

*Mengqi Zhou, Xipeng Wang, Yuxi Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoomCraft is a multi-stage pipeline for generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs, combining scene generation with constraint-driven optimization to address limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D indoor scene generation face challenges like repetitive elements, object collisions, and layout incompleteness, especially in multi-constraint scenarios.

Method: RoomCraft uses a structured pipeline to extract scene information, constructs a spatial relationship network, and employs a heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm for optimized placement. It introduces a unified constraint representation and a Conflict-Aware Positioning Strategy (CAPS) to handle complex constraints and minimize collisions.

Result: RoomCraft outperforms existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Conclusion: RoomCraft effectively addresses the limitations of current approaches, offering a robust solution for controllable and realistic 3D indoor scene generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

TL;DR: 4D-VLA improves robotic pretraining by integrating 4D (depth + temporal) information to address coordinate and state chaos, enhancing spatiotemporal reasoning and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incomplete inputs causing dispersed action distributions, hindering pretraining efficiency due to coordinate and state chaos.

Method: Proposes 4D-VLA, integrating depth and temporal data into visual features, and introduces memory bank sampling for informative frame extraction.

Result: Significantly outperforms OpenVLA in success rates, with strong spatial understanding and adaptability in simulated and real-world tests.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA effectively mitigates chaos in robotic pretraining, improving performance and generalization, as validated by MV-Bench.

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

*Luigi Russo, Deodato Tapete, Silvia Liberata Ullo, Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal DL framework uses single-date VHR SAR imagery and geospatial data for rapid building damage detection post-disaster, eliminating the need for pre-event imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quick and accurate building damage identification post-disaster is vital for emergency response, but optical imagery is often limited by cloud cover or lack of pre-event data.

Method: Integrates SAR imagery, OSM footprints, DSM data, and GEM attributes in a DL framework to detect damage using only post-event data.

Result: The method improves detection accuracy and generalizability, demonstrated on Turkey's 2023 earthquake dataset.

Conclusion: The framework offers reliable, rapid damage assessment without pre-event data, supporting scalable disaster management.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAMamba improves Vision Mamba for image restoration by addressing computational complexity and local pixel forgetting, achieving efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba excels in long-range dependency modeling but struggles with computational complexity and local pixel forgetting in low-level vision tasks.

Method: Introduces EAMamba with a Multi-Head Selective Scan Module (MHSSM) and all-around scanning to efficiently aggregate sequences and capture holistic information.

Result: EAMamba reduces FLOPs by 31-89% while maintaining performance in tasks like super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing.

Conclusion: EAMamba effectively addresses Vision Mamba's limitations, offering a more efficient and robust solution for image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) use scene context for object reference, introducing the COOCO dataset to test scene-object congruency and noise effects. Findings show adaptive context reliance, balancing local and contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if VLMs leverage scene context for object recognition and reference, similar to humans, by testing under varying congruency and noise conditions.

Method: Introduces the COOCO dataset to evaluate VLMs' reliance on scene context, analyzing performance under different scene-object congruency and noise levels, including attention mechanisms.

Result: VLMs adaptively use scene context, relying more when object-scene congruence is high or objects are degraded. Attention analysis shows mid-layer focus on targets under moderate noise.

Conclusion: VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for object reference, with context reliance varying by congruency and noise. The COOCO dataset and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparison of ResNet34 and ViT B16 for event-based cameras shows ResNet34's slight accuracy edge (88% vs. 86%), but ViT B16's robustness, especially with noise. Potential for UAV applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate deep learning models (ResNet34 and ViT B16) for event-based cameras, which are crucial for dynamic environments like UAVs and autonomous vehicles.

Method: Fine-tuned ResNet34 and ViT B16 on the GEN1 event-based dataset, tested under standard and noisy conditions.

Result: ResNet34 achieved 88% accuracy, ViT B16 86%, with ViT B16 showing better robustness despite smaller pre-training data.

Conclusion: ResNet34 is slightly more accurate, but ViT B16 is more robust. Findings suggest promise for UAV and aviation applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionDrop is a training-free, visual-only pruning framework for LVLMs that selects informative visual tokens using intra-modal attention, improving efficiency without relying on text signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-conditioned visual token reduction in LVLMs suffers from cross-modal misalignments, undermining effectiveness.

Method: VisionDrop uses intra-modal attention for token selection and a progressive pruning pipeline to suppress redundancy across the visual encoder and LLM.

Result: VisionDrop outperforms existing methods across benchmarks, maintaining performance under aggressive token budgets.

Conclusion: VisionDrop offers a simple, effective solution for efficient LVLM inference without additional training or complex modifications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMMs struggle with abstract and adaptive reasoning, needing to revise interpretations dynamically as new information emerges.

Method: Proposes Chain of Counterfactual Thought for classification and an ASR-LLM framework for generation, along with a new benchmark dataset and evaluation metric.

Result: Significant improvements in dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The DVidE task and proposed frameworks enhance VLMMs' ability to adaptively reason, addressing limitations in abstract reasoning.

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by integrating efficient video control and conditional outpainting branches, along with a mask-driven self-attention layer and latent alignment loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating high-quality, temporally and spatially consistent video content beyond original boundaries using diffusion transformers (DiTs).

Method: Proposes OutDreamer with two branches: efficient video control for extracting masked video info and conditional outpainting for generating missing content. Includes mask-driven self-attention and latent alignment loss for consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods on benchmarks, demonstrating superior adaptability and quality.

Conclusion: OutDreamer effectively tackles video outpainting with innovative components, achieving high performance and consistency.

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for improving visual localization by augmenting feature descriptors and translating them to a latent space, addressing cross-detector challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail in cross-feature detector scenarios due to low keypoint repeatability and descriptor limitations.

Method: Feature descriptor augmentation for cross-detector matching, followed by translation to a latent space.

Result: Significant improvement in image matching and visual localization in cross-feature scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses cross-detector challenges, enhancing performance in visual localization.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

*Hans Geißner, Christian Rathgeb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feature quantization method to address performance gaps in fuzzy vault-based BCS, reducing degradation caused by variable feature sizes and information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance gap in fuzzy vault-based BCS is due to unstable error correction and feature transformation issues.

Method: A novel feature quantization method using equal frequent intervals ensures fixed feature sizes and adapts without training.

Result: Experiments show minimal performance degradation across face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces performance gaps and integrates well with existing systems.

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

*Tiankai Chen, Yushu Li, Adam Goodge, Fei Teng, Xulei Yang, Tianrui Li, Xun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Graph Score Propagation (GSP) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of OOD detection in 3D point clouds, crucial for safe and robust perception, where existing 2D methods fall short.

Method: Leverages VLMs, constructs a graph with class prototypes and testing data, and introduces GSP with prompt clustering and self-training negative prompting.

Result: GSP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, adaptable to few-shot scenarios, and improves OOD detection in 3D point clouds.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a
challenge, particularly in applications where safe and robust perception is
critical. While existing OOD detection methods have shown progress for 2D image
data, extending these to 3D environments involves unique obstacles. This paper
introduces a training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds. By constructing a graph
based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with
VLM. Our method is also adaptable to few-shot scenarios, providing options for
practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real-world datasets 3D point

*Shih-Han Chou, Shivam Chandhok, James J. Little, Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time consistency framework improves semantic consistency in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without supervised re-training, using cross-entropy agreement and pseudo-label consistency losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs exhibit inconsistent behavior with semantically equivalent inputs, affecting reliability and robustness.

Method: Proposes a post-hoc, model-agnostic framework with cross-entropy agreement loss and pseudo-label consistency loss to enforce consistent predictions.

Result: Substantial gains in consistency on the MM-R3 benchmark without re-training.

Conclusion: The framework offers a plug-and-play solution for improving VLM consistency during inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

*Yuhao Liu, Tengfei Wang, Fang Liu, Zhenwei Wang, Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shape-for-Motion introduces a 3D proxy-based framework for precise and consistent video editing, enabling user edits on a single frame to propagate across the video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained alignment with user intentions in video editing, prompting the need for a more controllable solution.

Method: The framework converts video objects to time-consistent 3D meshes, uses a Dual-Propagation Strategy for edit propagation, and employs a decoupled video diffusion model for rendering.

Result: Supports diverse manipulations (pose, rotation, scaling, etc.) with high consistency and quality, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Shape-for-Motion advances controllable video editing, offering a robust workflow for precise user-driven modifications.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WarpRF is a training-free framework for quantifying uncertainty in radiance fields by leveraging backward warping and measuring consistency across viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a general-purpose, simple, and inexpensive method for uncertainty quantification in radiance fields without requiring training.

Method: Uses backward warping to project reliable renderings to unseen viewpoints and measures consistency with rendered images.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks like active view selection and mapping.

Conclusion: WarpRF is a versatile and effective tool for uncertainty quantification in radiance fields, applicable to any implementation without training.

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for linking visual cues across multiple images using self-supervised learning and rule-based reinforcement learning, achieving strong performance without human-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-image reasoning rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which are challenging for fine-grained details and complex logic. The paper aims to leverage inherent visual constraints for supervision.

Method: The approach constructs image triplets (two augmented views of the same image and a distinct image) and trains the model to compare them using CoT reasoning. Rule-based reinforcement learning optimizes the model.

Result: The method generalizes well to various questions and outperforms benchmarks in multi-image reasoning and general vision tasks without human-annotated data.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning and rule-based reinforcement learning enable effective CoT reasoning for multi-image tasks, demonstrating strong generalization and performance.

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes Event Data Association (EDA) for event data association and fusion, improving performance in challenging scenarios like high speed and motion blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of study on event data association in event-based vision tasks.

Method: Asynchronously fuses event data using information entropy, generates model hypotheses, and selects true models via a two-stage weighting algorithm.

Result: EDA effectively handles high speed, motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions in object tracking.

Conclusion: EDA provides a robust solution for event data association and fusion, outperforming in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Event-based approaches, which are based on bio-inspired asynchronous event
cameras, have achieved promising performance on various computer vision tasks.
However, the study of the fundamental event data association problem is still
in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association
(called EDA) approach to explicitly address the event association and fusion
problem. The proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the event
data, in order to perform unifying data association and information fusion. In
EDA, we first asynchronously fuse the event data based on its information
entropy. Then, we introduce a deterministic model hypothesis generation
strategy, which effectively generates model hypotheses from the fused events,
to represent the corresponding event trajectories. After that, we present a
two-stage weighting algorithm, which robustly weighs and selects true models
from the generated model hypotheses, through multi-structural geometric model
fitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an adaptive model selection strategy to
automatically determine the number of the true models. Finally, we use the
selected true models to associate and fuse the event data, without being
affected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The experimental results show
the effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios, such as high speed,
motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions.

Abstract: We introduce ProtoSeg, a novel model for interpretable semantic image

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) is considered the most effective defense against
adversarial attacks. However, a recent study revealed that
\(\ell_{\infty}\)-norm adversarial training (\(\ell_{\infty}\)-AT) will also
induce unevenly distributed input gradients, which is called the inequality
phenomenon. This phenomenon makes the \(\ell_{\infty}\)-norm adversarially
trained model more vulnerable than the standard-trained model when
high-attribution or randomly selected pixels are perturbed, enabling robust and
practical black-box attacks against \(\ell_{\infty}\)-adversarially trained
models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called Input
Gradient Distillation (IGD) to release the inequality phenomenon in
$\ell_{\infty}$-AT. IGD distills the standard-trained teacher model's equal
decision pattern into the $\ell_{\infty}$-adversarially trained student model
by aligning input gradients of the student model and the standard-trained model
with the Cosine Similarity. Experiments show that IGD can mitigate the
inequality phenomenon and its threats while preserving adversarial robustness.
Compared to vanilla $\ell_{\infty}$-AT, IGD reduces error rates against
inductive noise, inductive occlusion, random noise, and noisy images in
ImageNet-C by up to 60\%, 16\%, 50\%, and 21\%, respectively. Other than
empirical experiments, we also conduct a theoretical analysis to explain why
releasing the inequality phenomenon can improve such robustness and discuss why
the severity of the inequality phenomenon varies according to the dataset's
image resolution. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMConvex is a fast coarse-to-fine optimization method for CT registration, using self-supervised anatomical embedding (SAM) features to capture local and global information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing excessive computation burdens and lack of global semantic information in existing feature descriptors for image registration.

Method: Proposes SAMConvex, which extracts SAM features, builds 6D correlation volumes, and iteratively updates flow fields with a coarse-to-fine scheme.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on inter- and intra-patient CT datasets, with fast processing times (~2-5s per image pair).

Conclusion: SAMConvex efficiently combines local and global features for accurate and fast CT registration.

Abstract: Estimating displacement vector field via a cost volume computed in the
feature space has shown great success in image registration, but it suffers
excessive computation burdens. Moreover, existing feature descriptors only
extract local features incapable of representing the global semantic
information, which is especially important for solving large transformations.
To address the discussed issues, we propose SAMConvex, a fast coarse-to-fine
discrete optimization method for CT registration that includes a decoupled
convex optimization procedure to obtain deformation fields based on a
self-supervised anatomical embedding (SAM) feature extractor that captures both
local and global information. To be specific, SAMConvex extracts per-voxel
features and builds 6D correlation volumes based on SAM features, and
iteratively updates a flow field by performing lookups on the correlation
volumes with a coarse-to-fine scheme. SAMConvex outperforms the
state-of-the-art learning-based methods and optimization-based methods over two
inter-patient registration datasets (Abdomen CT and HeadNeck CT) and one
intra-patient registration dataset (Lung CT). Moreover, as an
optimization-based method, SAMConvex only takes $\sim2$s ($\sim5s$ with
instance optimization) for one paired images.

TL;DR: FSDA-DG improves cross-domain generalizability in medical image segmentation using semantics-guided semi-supervised data augmentation and a multi-decoder U-Net pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of limited labeled data and domain shifts in medical imaging by proposing a method that generalizes to unseen domains with minimal annotations.

Method: Introduces semantics-guided semi-supervised data augmentation and a multi-decoder U-Net pipeline for domain-invariant representation learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single domain generalization tasks with limited annotations.

Conclusion: FSDA-DG offers a practical solution for medical image segmentation with reduced annotation costs and improved generalizability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation faces significant challenges
arising from limited labeled data and domain shifts. While prior approaches
have primarily addressed these issues independently, their simultaneous
occurrence is common in medical imaging. A method that generalizes to unseen
domains using only minimal annotations offers significant practical value due
to reduced data annotation and development costs. In pursuit of this goal, we
propose FSDA-DG, a novel solution to improve cross-domain generalizability of
medical image segmentation with few single-source domain annotations.
Specifically, our approach introduces semantics-guided semi-supervised data
augmentation. This method divides images into global broad regions and
semantics-guided local regions, and applies distinct augmentation strategies to
enrich data distribution. Within this framework, both labeled and unlabeled
data are transformed into extensive domain knowledge while preserving
domain-invariant semantic information. Additionally, FSDA-DG employs a
multi-decoder U-Net pipeline semi-supervised learning (SSL) network to improve
domain-invariant representation learning through consistent prior assumption
across multiple perturbations. By integrating data-level and model-level
designs, FSDA-DG achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods in two challenging single domain generalization (SDG) tasks with
limited annotations. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially patch attacks on object detectors, necessitating robust defense strategies.

Method: Adversarial patches were optimized and placed using EigenCAM and grid search. Defenses tested include SAC, Inpainting, and Latent Diffusion Models.

Result: Adversarial patches reduced detection confidence by 22.06%. Latent Diffusion Models restored confidence by 26.61%, exceeding original levels.

Conclusion: Latent Diffusion Models are highly effective in defending against adversarial patch attacks on YOLOv5.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of computer vision systems has underscored their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks
on object detectors. This study evaluates defense mechanisms for the YOLOv5
model against such attacks. Optimized adversarial patches were generated and
placed in sensitive image regions, by applying EigenCAM and grid search to
determine optimal placement. We tested several defenses, including Segment and
Complete (SAC), Inpainting, and Latent Diffusion Models. Our pipeline comprises
three main stages: patch application, object detection, and defense analysis.
Results indicate that adversarial patches reduce average detection confidence
by 22.06\%. Defenses restored confidence levels by 3.45\% (SAC), 5.05\%
(Inpainting), and significantly improved them by 26.61\%, which even exceeds
the original accuracy levels, when using the Latent Diffusion Model,
highlighting its superior effectiveness in mitigating the effects of
adversarial patches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cell tracking methods lack long-term consistency and accurate lineage tree reconstruction due to reliance on local accuracy metrics.

Method: The authors propose uncertainty estimation for motion estimation and a mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation within multi-hypothesis tracking.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a factor of 6 on biologically inspired metrics across nine datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances tracking accuracy and provides new insights into motion estimation uncertainty.

Abstract: Cell tracking and segmentation assist biologists in extracting insights from
large-scale microscopy time-lapse data. Driven by local accuracy metrics,
current tracking approaches often suffer from a lack of long-term consistency
and the ability to reconstruct lineage trees correctly. To address this issue,
we introduce an uncertainty estimation technique for motion estimation
frameworks and extend the multi-hypothesis tracking framework. Our uncertainty
estimation lifts motion representations into probabilistic spatial densities
using problem-specific test-time augmentations. Moreover, we introduce a novel
mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation that allows multi-hypothesis
trackers to model cell splits and to resolve false associations and mitosis
detections based on long-term conflicts. In our framework, explicit biological
knowledge is modeled in assignment costs. We evaluate our approach on nine
competitive datasets and demonstrate that we outperform the current
state-of-the-art on biologically inspired metrics substantially, achieving
improvements by a factor of approximately 6 and uncover new insights into the
behavior of motion estimation uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a text-guided remote sensing image (RSI) editing method that trains on a single image, using multi-scale training and pre-trained VLMs to ensure accuracy and controllability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based RSI editing methods face challenges due to inadequate benchmark datasets and ambiguous text-image semantics, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The method employs multi-scale training, RSI pre-trained VLMs, and prompt ensembling (PE) to edit RSIs accurately without extensive benchmark datasets.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques in CLIP scores and subjective evaluations and demonstrates practicality in disaster assessment tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses RSI editing challenges, offering improved accuracy and controllability while validating its real-world utility.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence generative content (AIGC) has significantly impacted
image generation in the field of remote sensing. However, the equally important
area of remote sensing image (RSI) editing has not received sufficient
attention. Deep learning based editing methods generally involve two sequential
stages: generation and editing.For natural images, these stages primarily rely
on generative backbones pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets and text
guidance facilitated by vision-language models (VLMs). However, it become less
viable for RSIs: First, existing generative RSI benchmark datasets do not fully
capture the diversity of RSIs, and is often inadequate for universal editing
tasks. Second, the single text semantic corresponds to multiple image
semantics, leading to the introduction of incorrect semantics.To solve above
problems, this paper proposes a text-guided RSI editing method and can be
trained using only a single image. A multi-scale training approach is adopted
to preserve consistency without the need for training on extensive benchmarks,
while leveraging RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) to ensure
accuracy and controllability. Experimental results on multiple RSI editing
tasks show that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both CLIP
scores and subjective evaluations compared to existing methods. Additionally,
we explore the ability of the edited RSIs to support disaster assessment tasks
in order to validate their practicality. Codes will be released at

TL;DR: First truly end-to-end OMR system for full-page music scores, outperforming commercial tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of multi-stage OMR pipelines by proposing a simpler, more generalizable solution.

Method: Combines convolutional layers with autoregressive Transformers, trained via curriculum learning with synthetic data.

Result: Outperforms commercial OMR tools in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings on complex pianoform corpora.

Conclusion: The system advances OMR by enabling accurate, end-to-end transcription of full-page scores in complex layouts.

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has made significant progress since its
inception, with various approaches now capable of accurately transcribing music
scores into digital formats. Despite these advancements, most so-called
end-to-end OMR approaches still rely on multi-stage processing pipelines for
transcribing full-page score images, which entails challenges such as the need
for dedicated layout analysis and specific annotated data, thereby limiting the
general applicability of such methods. In this paper, we present the first
truly end-to-end approach for page-level OMR in complex layouts. Our system,
which combines convolutional layers with autoregressive Transformers, processes
an entire music score page and outputs a complete transcription in a music
encoding format. This is made possible by both the architecture and the
training procedure, which utilizes curriculum learning through incremental
synthetic data generation. We evaluate the proposed system using pianoform
corpora, which is one of the most complex sources in the OMR literature. This
evaluation is conducted first in a controlled scenario with synthetic data, and
subsequently against two real-world corpora of varying conditions. Our approach
is compared with leading commercial OMR software. The results demonstrate that
our system not only successfully transcribes full-page music scores but also
outperforms the commercial tool in both zero-shot settings and after
fine-tuning with the target domain, representing a significant contribution to
the field of OMR.

*Xiaojie Li, Yibo Yang, Jianlong Wu, Yue Yu, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Liqiang Nie, Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mamba-FSCIL, a method using Selective State Space Models (SSMs) for few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL), achieving state-of-the-art performance by dynamically adjusting processing patterns within a fixed architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSCIL methods struggle with overfitting or increased complexity due to fixed or dynamic architectures. The study explores SSMs to balance knowledge preservation and adaptation.

Method: Mamba-FSCIL employs a dual selective SSM projector and a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to dynamically adapt to novel classes while preserving base-class knowledge.

Result: Experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 show Mamba-FSCIL outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Mamba-FSCIL effectively addresses the FSCIL challenge by leveraging SSMs for dynamic adaptation within a fixed architecture, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally learn novel
classes from limited examples while preserving knowledge of previously learned
classes. Existing methods face a critical dilemma: static architectures rely on
a fixed parameter space to learn from data that arrive sequentially, prone to
overfitting to the current session, while dynamic architectures require the
expansion of the parameter space continually, leading to increased complexity.
In this study, we explore the potential of Selective State Space Models (SSMs)
for FSCIL. Mamba leverages its input-dependent parameters to dynamically adjust
its processing patterns and generate content-aware scan patterns within a fixed
architecture. This enables it to configure distinct processing for base and
novel classes, effectively preserving existing knowledge while adapting to new
ones. To leverage Mamba's potential for FSCIL, we design two key modules:
First, we propose a dual selective SSM projector that dynamically adjusts the
projection parameters based on the intermediate features for dynamic
adaptation. The dual-design structurally decouples base and novel class
processing with a frozen base branch, employing a frozen base branch to
maintain robust base-class features and a dynamic incremental branch that
adaptively learns distinctive feature shifts for novel classes. Second, we
develop a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation
of the incremental branch. It minimizes the disruption to base-class
representations caused by training on novel data, and meanwhile, forces the
selective scan to perform in distinct patterns between base and novel classes.

*Jia-Hau Bai, Chi-Ting Liu, Yu Wang, Fu-Chieh Chang, Pei-Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPM improves verified bounds for maxpool-based CNNs using convex relaxation, achieving higher precision and lower computational cost than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the verification of maxpool-based CNNs under adversarial perturbations, addressing computational inefficiencies in current methods.

Method: Decomposes maxpool into ReLU functions for convex relaxation, enabling efficient computation via a dual network.

Result: CAPM outperforms DeepZ, DeepPoly, and PRIMA in speed (up to 40x faster) and precision (98% vs. 8-76%).

Conclusion: CAPM is a scalable, efficient solution for verifying large-scale maxpool-based CNNs with superior performance.

Abstract: This study uses CAPM (Convex Adversarial Polytope for Maxpool-based CNN) to
improve the verified bound for general purpose maxpool-based convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) under bounded norm adversarial perturbations. The
maxpool function is decomposed as a series of ReLU functions to extend the
convex relaxation technique to maxpool functions, by which the verified bound
can be efficiently computed through a dual network. The experimental results
demonstrate that this technique allows the state-of-the-art verification
precision for maxpool-based CNNs and involves a much lower computational cost
than current verification methods, such as DeepZ, DeepPoly and PRIMA. This
method is also applicable to large-scale CNNs, which previous studies show to
be often computationally prohibitively expensive. Under certain circumstances,
CAPM is 40-times, 20-times or twice as fast and give a significantly higher
verification bound (CAPM 98% vs. PRIMA 76%/DeepPoly 73%/DeepZ 8%) as compared
to PRIMA/DeepPoly/DeepZ. Furthermore, we additionally present the time
complexity of our algorithm as $O(W^2NK)$, where $W$ is the maximum width of
the neural network, $N$ is the number of neurons, and $K$ is the size of the
maxpool layer's kernel.

*Dongwei Ren, Xinya Shu, Yu Li, Xiaohe Wu, Jin Li, Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reblurring-guided learning framework is introduced for single image defocus deblurring, addressing misalignment in training pairs and enabling pseudo supervision for defocus blur maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on perfectly aligned training pairs, which are hard to acquire in real-world scenarios due to misalignment issues.

Method: The framework reconstructs spatially variant isotropic blur kernels to ensure consistency between deblurred, reblurred, and input images, and introduces a lightweight defocus blur estimator.

Result: The method effectively extracts sharp textures and transforms training pairs into triplets, enhancing deblurring performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses misalignment issues and improves deblurring, validated by a new dataset (SDD) for future research.

Abstract: For single image defocus deblurring, acquiring well-aligned training pairs
(or training triplets), i.e., a defocus blurry image, an all-in-focus sharp
image (and a defocus blur map), is a challenging task for developing effective
deblurring models. Existing image defocus deblurring methods typically rely on
training data collected by specialized imaging equipment, with the assumption
that these pairs or triplets are perfectly aligned. However, in practical
scenarios involving the collection of real-world data, direct acquisition of
training triplets is infeasible, and training pairs inevitably encounter
spatial misalignment issues. In this work, we introduce a reblurring-guided
learning framework for single image defocus deblurring, enabling the learning
of a deblurring network even with misaligned training pairs. By reconstructing
spatially variant isotropic blur kernels, our reblurring module ensures spatial
consistency between the deblurred image, the reblurred image and the input
blurry image, thereby addressing the misalignment issue while effectively
extracting sharp textures from the all-in-focus sharp image. Moreover,
spatially variant blur can be derived from the reblurring module, and serve as
pseudo supervision for defocus blur map during training, interestingly
transforming training pairs into training triplets. To leverage this pseudo
supervision, we propose a lightweight defocus blur estimator coupled with a
fusion block, which enhances deblurring performance through seamless
integration with state-of-the-art deblurring networks. Additionally, we have
collected a new dataset for single image defocus deblurring (SDD) with typical
misalignments, which not only validates our proposed method but also serves as
a benchmark for future research.

*Shih-Han Chou, Shivam Chandhok, James J. Little, Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores consistency in Vision Language Models (VLMs), proposing the MM-R3 benchmark to evaluate performance on tasks like Question Rephrasing, Image Restyling, and Context Reasoning. It finds that consistency and accuracy don't always align and introduces an adapter module to improve consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked aspect of consistency in VLMs, which is crucial for robustness and trust, complementing traditional accuracy evaluations.

Method: Proposes the MM-R3 benchmark to assess VLM performance on consistency and accuracy across three tasks. Introduces an adapter module to mitigate inconsistency.

Result: Consistency and accuracy are not always correlated. The adapter module improves consistency by 5.7% and 12.5% on BLIP-2 and LLaVa 1.5M.

Conclusion: Consistency is a critical but distinct aspect of VLM performance. The proposed adapter effectively enhances consistency, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs and variants, a flurry of research has emerged,
analyzing the performance of such models across an array of tasks. While most
studies focus on evaluating the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through task accuracy (e.g., visual question answering,
grounding), our work explores the related but complementary aspect of
consistency - the ability of a VLM to produce semantically similar or identical
responses to semantically similar queries. We note that consistency is a
fundamental prerequisite (necessary but not sufficient condition) for
robustness and trust in VLMs. Armed with this perspective, we propose the MM-R3
benchmark, which allows us to analyze performance, in terms of consistency and
accuracy, of SoTA VLMs on three tasks: Question Rephrasing, Image Restyling,
and Context Reasoning. Our analysis reveals that consistency does not always
align with accuracy, indicating that models with higher accuracy are not
necessarily more consistent, and vice versa. Furthermore, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy in the form of an adapter module trained to
minimize inconsistency across prompts. With our proposed strategy, we are able
to achieve absolute improvements of 5.7% and 12.5%, on average on widely used
VLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVa 1.5M in terms of consistency over their existing
counterparts.

TL;DR: DiffusionGS is a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model that generates 3D Gaussian point clouds directly, ensuring view consistency and robustness across prompt directions, outperforming existing methods in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward image-to-3D methods lack 3D consistency and struggle with non-object-centric cases, prompting the need for a more robust and versatile solution.

Method: The paper introduces DiffusionGS, a single-stage 3D diffusion model that outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep. It employs a scene-object mixed training strategy to enhance capability and generality.

Result: DiffusionGS improves PSNR/FID by 2.20 dB/23.25 for objects and 1.34 dB/19.16 for scenes, while being over 5x faster (~6s on an A100 GPU).

Conclusion: DiffusionGS offers a significant advancement in 3D generation, ensuring consistency, robustness, and efficiency, with potential applications beyond object-centric cases.

Abstract: Existing feedforward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view
diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily
collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle
object-centric cases. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D
diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object generation and scene reconstruction
from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at
each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate
robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs.
Plus, to improve the capability and generality of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D
training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments
show that DiffusionGS yields improvements of 2.20 dB/23.25 and 1.34 dB/19.16 in
PSNR/FID for objects and scenes than the state-of-the-art methods, without
depth estimator. Plus, our method enjoys over 5$\times$ faster speed ($\sim$6s
on an A100 GPU). Our Project page at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchDPO improves finetuning-free personalized image generation by introducing a patch-level quality estimation and training method, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current finetuning-free methods produce low-quality images inconsistent with references. PatchDPO addresses this by refining pre-trained models using patch-level quality assessment.

Method: Proposes PatchDPO, leveraging a pre-trained vision model for self-supervised patch quality estimation and weighted training to reward high-quality patches.

Result: PatchDPO significantly enhances performance of pre-trained models, achieving state-of-the-art results in single and multi-object image generation.

Conclusion: PatchDPO effectively improves image quality and consistency with references, advancing finetuning-free personalized generation.

Abstract: Finetuning-free personalized image generation can synthesize customized
images without test-time finetuning, attracting wide research interest owing to
its high efficiency. Current finetuning-free methods simply adopt a single
training stage with a simple image reconstruction task, and they typically
generate low-quality images inconsistent with the reference images during
test-time. To mitigate this problem, inspired by the recent DPO (i.e., direct
preference optimization) technique, this work proposes an additional training
stage to improve the pre-trained personalized generation models. However,
traditional DPO only determines the overall superiority or inferiority of two
samples, which is not suitable for personalized image generation because the
generated images are commonly inconsistent with the reference images only in
some local image patches. To tackle this problem, this work proposes PatchDPO
that estimates the quality of image patches within each generated image and
accordingly trains the model. To this end, PatchDPO first leverages the
pre-trained vision model with a proposed self-supervised training method to
estimate the patch quality. Next, PatchDPO adopts a weighted training approach
to train the model with the estimated patch quality, which rewards the image
patches with high quality while penalizing the image patches with low quality.
Experiment results demonstrate that PatchDPO significantly improves the
performance of multiple pre-trained personalized generation models, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multi-object
personalized image generation. Our code is available at

### [252] [KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04783)
*Zijian Zhao, Zhijie Cai, Tingwei Chen, Xiaoyang Li, Hang Li, Qimei Chen, Guangxu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KNN-MMD, a few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing, addressing issues like environmental sensitivity and inter-category misalignment in existing Domain Alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless sensing models degrade in performance when applied to new environments due to CSI sensitivity. Existing methods like DAL fail to account for inter-category relationships, leading to misalignment.

Method: Proposes KNN-MMD, which uses KNN to create a help set for local alignment with MMD, stabilizes training, and uses a support set for validation.

Result: The method improves cross-domain classification by addressing misalignment and instability, with publicly available dataset and code.

Conclusion: KNN-MMD effectively enhances cross-domain wireless sensing by focusing on local alignment and training stability, outperforming traditional DAL methods.

Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse
environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing
patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human
actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall
detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where
even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This
sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when
applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To
address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for
cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global
distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its
popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to
misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is
achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless
sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the
target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains
within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability
issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance
fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to
determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of
labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the
support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a
validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are
publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .

*Connor Malone, Somayeh Hussaini, Tobias Fischer, Michael Milford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOPS improves VPR performance by fusing descriptors from multiple reference sets under different conditions, leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing for scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent VPR methods face scalability and compute challenges when handling diverse environmental conditions.

Method: Proposes HOPS, which fuses descriptors from multiple reference sets using Hyperdimensional Computing to enhance scalability and performance.

Result: HOPS significantly improves recall performance across VPR methods and datasets, with no compute penalty for descriptor fusion.

Conclusion: HOPS offers a scalable, efficient solution for VPR, enabling new applications like dimensionality reduction and coarse localization.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables coarse localization by comparing query
images to a reference database of geo-tagged images. Recent breakthroughs in
deep learning architectures and training regimes have led to methods with
improved robustness to factors like environment appearance change, but with the
downside that the required training and/or matching compute scales with the
number of distinct environmental conditions encountered. Here, we propose
Hyperdimensional One Place Signatures (HOPS) to simultaneously improve the
performance, compute and scalability of these state-of-the-art approaches by
fusing the descriptors from multiple reference sets captured under different
conditions. HOPS scales to any number of environmental conditions by leveraging
the Hyperdimensional Computing framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that our approach is highly generalizable and consistently improves recall
performance across all evaluated VPR methods and datasets by large margins.
Arbitrarily fusing reference images without compute penalty enables numerous
other useful possibilities, three of which we demonstrate here: descriptor
dimensionality reduction with no performance penalty, stacking synthetic
images, and coarse localization to an entire traverse or environmental section.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-based image editing method for object parts using pre-trained diffusion models, addressing fine-grained edits by learning special textual tokens for part localization and seamless execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models lack understanding of object parts, limiting fine-grained edits.

Method: Learn special textual tokens for object parts via token optimization, use masks for localization, and apply feature-blending and adaptive thresholding for edits.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on all metrics and is preferred by users 66-90% of the time.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables fine-grained text-based image editing of object parts.

Abstract: We present the first text-based image editing approach for object parts based
on pre-trained diffusion models. Diffusion-based image editing approaches
capitalized on the deep understanding of diffusion models of image semantics to
perform a variety of edits. However, existing diffusion models lack sufficient
understanding of many object parts, hindering fine-grained edits requested by
users. To address this, we propose to expand the knowledge of pre-trained
diffusion models to allow them to understand various object parts, enabling
them to perform fine-grained edits. We achieve this by learning special textual
tokens that correspond to different object parts through an efficient token
optimization process. These tokens are optimized to produce reliable
localization masks at each inference step to localize the editing region.
Leveraging these masks, we design feature-blending and adaptive thresholding
strategies to execute the edits seamlessly. To evaluate our approach, we
establish a benchmark and an evaluation protocol for part editing. Experiments
show that our approach outperforms existing editing methods on all metrics and
is preferred by users 66-90% of the time in conducted user studies.

*Hongyu An, Xinfeng Zhang, Shijie Zhao, Li Zhang, Ruiqin Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model (SDATC) is proposed for compressed video super-resolution, addressing spatial distortions and temporal inconsistencies with specialized modules (DCM, CAPM, STAM) and optical flow alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods inadequately handle compressed videos, especially those with low bit rates, due to quantization loss and artifacts. Diffusion models' high-realism generation capability is leveraged to address this gap.

Method: The SDATC model includes a distortion control module (DCM), compression-aware prompt module (CAPM), and spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). Optical flow alignment is used during denoising to enhance video smoothness.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the model effectively restores compressed videos by mitigating spatial distortions and improving temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed SDATC model successfully addresses the limitations of general VSR methods for compressed videos, demonstrating superior performance in detail reconstruction and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Due to storage and bandwidth limitations, videos transmitted over the
Internet often exhibit low quality, characterized by low-resolution and
compression artifacts. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient
video enhancing technique, existing VSR methods focus less on compressed
videos. Consequently, directly applying general VSR approaches fails to improve
practical videos with compression artifacts, especially when frames are highly
compressed at a low bit rate. The inevitable quantization information loss
complicates the reconstruction of texture details. Recently, diffusion models
have shown superior performance in low-level visual tasks. Leveraging the
high-realism generation capability of diffusion models, we propose a novel
method that exploits the priors of pre-trained diffusion models for compressed
VSR. To mitigate spatial distortions and refine temporal consistency, we
introduce a Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion
model. Specifically, we incorporate a distortion control module (DCM) to
modulate diffusion model inputs, thereby minimizing the impact of noise from
low-quality frames on the generation stage. Subsequently, the diffusion model
performs a denoising process to generate details, guided by a fine-tuned
compression-aware prompt module (CAPM) and a spatio-temporal attention module
(STAM). CAPM dynamically encodes compression-related information into prompts,
enabling the sampling process to adapt to different degradation levels.
Meanwhile, STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism into the
spatio-temporal dimension, effectively capturing temporal correlations.
Additionally, we utilize optical flow-based alignment during each denoising
step to enhance the smoothness of output videos. Extensive experimental results
on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules in
restoring compressed videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DS4D, a method to improve dynamic 3D object generation from videos by decoupling dynamic-static features and enhancing dynamic representations with a temporal-spatial fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often overlook dynamic regions in videos, leading to blurry textures due to overfitting on static regions.

Method: Introduces a dynamic-static feature decoupling module (DSFD) and a temporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF) to enhance dynamic representations and motion prediction.

Result: DS4D achieves state-of-the-art results in video-to-4D generation and performs well on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the issue of blurry textures by decoupling and enhancing dynamic features, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recently, the generation of dynamic 3D objects from a video has shown
impressive results. Existing methods directly optimize Gaussians using whole
information in frames. However, when dynamic regions are interwoven with static
regions within frames, particularly if the static regions account for a large
proportion, existing methods often overlook information in dynamic regions and
are prone to overfitting on static regions. This leads to producing results
with blurry textures. We consider that decoupling dynamic-static features to
enhance dynamic representations can alleviate this issue. Thus, we propose a
dynamic-static feature decoupling module (DSFD). Along temporal axes, it
regards the regions of current frame features that possess significant
differences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features.
Conversely, the remaining parts are the static features. Then, we acquire
decoupled features driven by dynamic features and current frame features.
Moreover, to further enhance the dynamic representation of decoupled features
from different viewpoints and ensure accurate motion prediction, we design a
temporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF). Along spatial axes, it
adaptively selects similar information of dynamic regions. Hinging on the
above, we construct a novel approach, DS4D. Experimental results verify our
method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in video-to-4D. In addition,
the experiments on a real-world scenario dataset demonstrate its effectiveness
on the 4D scene. Our code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: KITAB-Bench is a new Arabic OCR benchmark addressing unique challenges like cursive script and complex typography. It shows modern vision-language models outperform traditional OCR by 60% in CER, but gaps remain in PDF-to-Markdown conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic OCR lacks robust benchmarks despite its unique challenges (cursive script, right-to-left flow). KITAB-Bench fills this gap to improve Arabic document analysis.

Method: Developed KITAB-Bench, a benchmark with 8,809 samples across 9 domains, including handwritten text and tables. Evaluated modern vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4o) against traditional OCR tools.

Result: Modern models outperform traditional OCR by 60% in CER. However, PDF-to-Markdown conversion accuracy is only 65%, highlighting persistent challenges.

Conclusion: KITAB-Bench provides a rigorous framework to advance Arabic OCR, addressing gaps in performance compared to English OCR technologies.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in document
processing, robust text recognition has become increasingly critical for
knowledge extraction. While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and
other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks,
Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left
text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present
KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in
current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9
major domains and 36 sub-domains, encompassing diverse document types including
handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types
for business intelligence. Our findings show that modern vision-language models
(such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen) outperform traditional OCR approaches (like
EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an average of 60% in Character Error Rate
(CER). Furthermore, we highlight significant limitations of current Arabic OCR
models, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where the best model
Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only 65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges in
accurately recognizing Arabic text, including issues with complex fonts,
numeral recognition errors, word elongation, and table structure detection.
This work establishes a rigorous evaluation framework that can drive
improvements in Arabic document analysis methods and bridge the performance gap
with English OCR technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns hinder pre-training or updating generalist medical AI models across domains, leading to a focus on specialist models. Med-LEGO addresses this by enabling seamless integration of specialist models.

Method: Med-LEGO combines specialist models like LEGO bricks, using SVD-enhanced LoRA to capture domain expertise with minimal parameters. It integrates weights without original data or retraining.

Result: Med-LEGO outperforms existing methods in cross-domain and in-domain tasks, using only 0.18% of full model parameters, and shows better convergence and generalization.

Conclusion: Med-LEGO provides an effective, versatile path toward generalist medical AI by efficiently combining specialist models without retraining.

Abstract: The adoption of visual foundation models has become a common practice in
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). While these foundation models provide a viable
solution for creating generalist medical AI, privacy concerns make it difficult
to pre-train or continuously update such models across multiple domains and
datasets, leading many studies to focus on specialist models. To address this
challenge, we propose Med-LEGO, a training-free framework that enables the
seamless integration or updating of a generalist CAD model by combining
multiple specialist models, similar to assembling LEGO bricks. Med-LEGO
enhances LoRA (low-rank adaptation) by incorporating singular value
decomposition (SVD) to efficiently capture the domain expertise of each
specialist model with minimal additional parameters. By combining these adapted
weights through simple operations, Med-LEGO allows for the easy integration or
modification of specific diagnostic capabilities without the need for original
data or retraining. Finally, the combined model can be further adapted to new
diagnostic tasks, making it a versatile generalist model. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that Med-LEGO outperforms existing methods in both
cross-domain and in-domain medical tasks while using only 0.18% of full model
parameters. These merged models show better convergence and generalization to
new tasks, providing an effective path toward generalist medical AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIP is a self-supervised pretraining framework for lightweight vision models, addressing limitations in generalizability and model size for human-centric visual perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HVP models lack generalizability and are too large for real-world applications, necessitating a scalable and efficient pretraining approach.

Method: SAIP introduces three cross-scale consistency objectives: Cross-scale Matching (CSM), Cross-scale Reconstruction (CSR), and Cross-scale Search (CSS).

Result: SAIP outperforms existing methods, achieving 3%-13% gains in single-person tasks, 1%-11% in dense prediction, and 1%-6% in multi-person tasks.

Conclusion: SAIP effectively learns multi-scale generalizable patterns, enhancing performance and compatibility for HVP downstream tasks.

Abstract: Human-centric visual perception (HVP) has recently achieved remarkable
progress due to advancements in large-scale self-supervised pretraining (SSP).
However, existing HVP models face limitations in adapting to real-world
applications, which require general visual patterns for downstream tasks while
maintaining computationally sustainable costs to ensure compatibility with edge
devices. These limitations primarily arise from two issues: 1) the pretraining
objectives focus solely on specific visual patterns, limiting the
generalizability of the learned patterns for diverse downstream tasks; and 2)
HVP models often exhibit excessively large model sizes, making them
incompatible with real-world applications.To address these limitations, we
introduce Scale-Aware Image Pretraining (SAIP), a novel SSP framework
pretraining lightweight vision models to acquire general patterns for HVP.
Specifically, SAIP incorporates three learning objectives based on the
principle of cross-scale consistency: 1) Cross-scale Matching (CSM) which
contrastively learns image-level invariant patterns from multi-scale
single-person images; 2) Cross-scale Reconstruction (CSR) which learns
pixel-level consistent visual structures from multi-scale masked single-person
images; and 3) Cross-scale Search (CSS) which learns to capture diverse
patterns from multi-scale multi-person images. Three objectives complement one
another, enabling lightweight models to learn multi-scale generalizable
patterns essential for HVP downstream tasks.Extensive experiments conducted
across 12 HVP datasets demonstrate that SAIP exhibits remarkable generalization
capabilities across 9 human-centric vision tasks. Moreover, it achieves
significant performance improvements over existing methods, with gains of
3%-13% in single-person discrimination tasks, 1%-11% in dense prediction tasks,
and 1%-6% in multi-person visual understanding tasks.

*Ruichen Chen, Keith G. Mills, Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FP4DiT introduces Floating-Point Quantization (FPQ) for Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to improve efficiency and performance over integer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for Diffusion Models (DMs), especially for newer DiT architectures, by exploring FPQ for better alignment with weight and activation distributions.

Method: FP4DiT leverages FPQ for W4A6 quantization, extending Adaptive Rounding PTQ for weight calibration and introducing robust online activation quantization techniques.

Result: FP4DiT outperforms integer-based PTQ at W4A6 and W4A8 precision, generating high-quality images on PixArt-α, PixArt-Σ, and Hunyuan, as measured by metrics like HPSv2 and CLIP.

Conclusion: FPQ is a promising alternative to integer quantization for DiT models, offering improved efficiency and visual quality in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DM) have revolutionized the text-to-image visual generation
process. However, the large computational cost and model footprint of DMs
hinders practical deployment, especially on edge devices. Post-training
quantization (PTQ) is a lightweight method to alleviate these burdens without
the need for training or fine-tuning. While recent DM PTQ methods achieve W4A8
on integer-based PTQ, two key limitations remain: First, while most existing DM
PTQ methods evaluate on classical DMs like Stable Diffusion XL, 1.5 or earlier,
which use convolutional U-Nets, newer Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models like
the PixArt series, Hunyuan and others adopt fundamentally different transformer
backbones to achieve superior image synthesis. Second, integer (INT)
quantization is prevailing in DM PTQ but doesn't align well with the network
weight and activation distribution, while Floating-Point Quantization (FPQ) is
still under-investigated, yet it holds the potential to better align the weight
and activation distributions in low-bit settings for DiT. In response, we
introduce FP4DiT, a PTQ method that leverages FPQ to achieve W4A6 quantization.
Specifically, we extend and generalize the Adaptive Rounding PTQ technique to
adequately calibrate weight quantization for FPQ and demonstrate that DiT
activations depend on input patch data, necessitating robust online activation
quantization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that FP4DiT
outperforms integer-based PTQ at W4A6 and W4A8 precision and generates
convincing visual content on PixArt-$\alpha$, PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Hunyuan in
terms of several T2I metrics such as HPSv2 and CLIP.

### [261] [Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16069)
*Aniek Eijpe, Soufyan Lakbir, Melis Erdal Cesur, Sara P. Oliveira, Sanne Abeln, Wilson Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIMAF improves cancer survival prediction by disentangling modality-shared and modality-specific features using attention-based fusion and Distance Correlation loss, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal frameworks often mix modality-shared and modality-specific information, reducing interpretability and feature discrimination.

Method: Proposes DIMAF, which separates intra- and inter-modal interactions via attention-based fusion, uses Distance Correlation loss for disentanglement, and integrates Shapley explanations for interpretability.

Result: Achieves 1.85% better performance and 23.7% higher disentanglement than state-of-the-art models on four cancer survival datasets.

Conclusion: DIMAF enhances prediction accuracy and interpretability, enabling deeper insights into multimodal interactions in cancer biology.

Abstract: To improve the prediction of cancer survival using whole-slide images and
transcriptomics data, it is crucial to capture both modality-shared and
modality-specific information. However, multimodal frameworks often entangle
these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressing
discriminative features. To address this, we propose Disentangled and
Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that
separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based
fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared
representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote
disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive
explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We
evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative
average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement
compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved
performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the
underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.

*Zizhi Chen, Minghao Han, Xukun Zhang, Shuwei Ma, Tao Liu, Xing Wei, Lihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGAT uses Visual Question Answering to reconstruct genomic data from pathology images, enabling survival prediction without genomic sequencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome barriers in clinical implementation due to limited genomic sequencing access in under-resourced regions.

Method: Integrates VQA techniques for genomic modality reconstruction and uses a cluster-based visual prompt module to enhance discriminative WSI patches.

Result: Outperforms existing WSI-only methods across five TCGA datasets.

Conclusion: VGAT bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Multimodal learning combining pathology images and genomic sequences enhances
cancer survival analysis but faces clinical implementation barriers due to
limited access to genomic sequencing in under-resourced regions. To enable
survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the
Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating
Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction.
By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic
representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data.
Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances
discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions.
Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only
methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without
sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility
in resource-constrained settings. The code link is

*Joao Pereira, Vasco Lopes, David Semedo, Joao Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SelfReS improves long-video understanding in LVLMs by dynamically selecting key fragments using sparse attention maps, boosting accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with long-video tasks due to linear frame sampling, which misses key events or includes irrelevant data.

Method: Proposes SelfReS, a non-linear spatiotemporal sampling method using LVLMs' sparse attention maps for dynamic fragment selection.

Result: SelfReS enhances accuracy in long-video tasks and speeds up inference by 46% without extra training.

Conclusion: SelfReS effectively addresses LVLMs' limitations in long-video understanding with dynamic, relevance-aware sampling.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance in
short-video tasks such as video question answering, but struggle in long-video
understanding. The linear frame sampling strategy, conventionally used by
LVLMs, fails to account for the non-linear distribution of key events in video
data, often introducing redundant or irrelevant information in longer contexts
while risking the omission of critical events in shorter ones. To address this,
we propose SelfReS, a non-linear spatiotemporal self-reflective sampling method
that dynamically selects key video fragments based on user prompts. Unlike
prior approaches, SelfReS leverages the inherently sparse attention maps of
LVLMs to define reflection tokens, enabling relevance-aware token selection
without requiring additional training or external modules. Experiments
demonstrate that SelfReS can be seamlessly integrated into strong base LVLMs,
improving long-video task accuracy and achieving up to 46% faster inference
speed within the same GPU memory budget.

*Linfeng Tang, Yeda Wang, Meiqi Gong, Zizhuo Li, Yuxin Deng, Xunpeng Yi, Chunyu Li, Han Xu, Hao Zhang, Jiayi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3SVD, a large-scale multi-sensor video dataset, and VideoFusion, a model for spatio-temporally coherent video fusion, addressing gaps in video-based multi-sensor fusion research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion research focuses on images, not videos, due to dataset scarcity and the challenge of modeling spatial-temporal dependencies. This paper aims to fill these gaps.

Method: 1) Constructs M3SVD dataset with synchronized infrared-visible video pairs. 2) Proposes VideoFusion with a differential reinforcement module, modality-guided fusion, and bi-temporal co-attention for dynamic feature aggregation.

Result: VideoFusion outperforms image-based fusion methods, reducing temporal inconsistency and interference in sequential scenarios.

Conclusion: The work advances video fusion by providing a dataset and model that leverage cross-modal and temporal dynamics, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios
and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion
research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images
rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of
large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and
2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal
dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the
dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally
synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising
153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly,
we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits
cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally
coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically,
1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information
interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is
employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal
co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward
temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive
experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion
paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal
inconsistency and interference.

### [265] [Boosting MLLM Reasoning with Text-Debiased Hint-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23905)
*Qihan Huang, Weilong Dai, Jinlong Liu, Wanggui He, Hao Jiang, Mingli Song, Jingyuan Chen, Chang Yao, Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hint-GRPO to address low data utilization and text-bias in MLLM reasoning, improving performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRPO methods in MLLM reasoning struggle with difficult tasks due to low data utilization and text-bias, prompting the need for better solutions.

Method: Proposes Hint-GRPO for adaptive hinting and text-bias calibration to enhance data utilization and mitigate bias.

Result: Experiments on three MLLMs across eleven datasets show significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: Hint-GRPO effectively advances MLLM reasoning, outperforming current approaches and addressing key limitations.

Abstract: MLLM reasoning has drawn widespread research for its excellent
problem-solving capability. Current reasoning methods fall into two types: PRM,
which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps, and ORM, which supervises
the final results. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view
that PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance
using an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still
struggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g.,
mathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the
performance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data
utilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the
MLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses
image condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO
training. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves
data utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying
difficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating
the token prediction logits with image condition in test-time. Experiment
results on three base MLLMs across eleven datasets demonstrate that our
proposed methods advance the reasoning capability of original MLLM by a large
margin, exhibiting superior performance to existing MLLM reasoning methods. Our
code is available at https://github.com/hqhQAQ/Hint-GRPO.

*Yechan Kim, DongHo Yoon, SooYeon Kim, Moongu Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSegment, a data augmentation method, improves RS image segmentation by applying elastic transformations to labels, addressing annotation inconsistencies without increasing training complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling errors in RS datasets due to ambiguous boundaries, mixed pixels, and subjective bias, along with data scarcity, hinder noise-robust model training.

Method: NSegment applies elastic transformations to segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per sample in each epoch to handle annotation inconsistencies.

Result: The approach enhances performance of RS image segmentation across state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: NSegment offers a simple, effective solution to mitigate labeling errors in RS datasets without added training complexity.

Abstract: Labeling errors in remote sensing (RS) image segmentation datasets often
remain implicit and subtle due to ambiguous class boundaries, mixed pixels,
shadows, complex terrain features, and subjective annotator bias. Furthermore,
the scarcity of annotated RS data due to high image acquisition and labeling
costs complicates training noise-robust models. While sophisticated mechanisms
such as label selection or noise correction might address this issue, they tend
to increase training time and add implementation complexity. In this letter, we
propose NSegment-a simple yet effective data augmentation solution to mitigate
this issue. Unlike traditional methods, it applies elastic transformations only
to segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per sample in each
training epoch to address annotation inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of RS image segmentation
on various state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: A survey on unifying multimodal understanding and image generation models, covering foundational concepts, existing unified models, datasets, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The independent evolution of multimodal understanding and image generation models has created architectural disparities, prompting interest in unified frameworks.

Method: The paper reviews and categorizes unified models into diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches, analyzing their designs and innovations.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive overview of unified models, datasets, benchmarks, and identifies key challenges like tokenization and cross-modal attention.

Conclusion: The field is nascent but promising, with rapid advancements expected. The survey aims to inspire research and serve as a community reference.

Abstract: Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding
models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these
two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural
paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal
understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image
generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified
frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new
capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for
unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains
pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts
toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future
research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements
in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we
review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural
paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that
fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the
structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally,
we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering
resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing
this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and
data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid
advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire
further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The

### [268] [Split Matching for Inductive Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05023)
*Jialei Chen, Xu Zheng, Dongyue Li, Chong Yi, Seigo Ito, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool, Hiroshi Murase, Daisuke Deguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) that decouples Hungarian matching into seen and unseen class components, improving performance on unseen categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for ZSS overfit to seen categories due to lack of supervision for unseen classes, and conventional Hungarian matching misclassifies unseen categories as background.

Method: SM partitions queries into seen and candidate groups, uses CLIP dense features for pseudo masks, and matches separately. A Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module refines decoder features.

Result: SM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: SM effectively addresses the limitations of conventional Hungarian matching in ZSS, enabling better segmentation of unseen categories.

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not
annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has
achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due
to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully
supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS,
as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However,
conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks,
needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background
in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a
novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two
components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent
classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates).
Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling
each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To
discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo
masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then
conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity
and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature
Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual
multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial
details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian
matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two standard benchmarks.

*Daoxi Cao, Hangbei Cheng, Yijin Li, Ruolin Zhou, Xuehan Zhang, Xinyi Li, Binwei Li, Xuancheng Gu, Jianan Zhang, Xueyu Liu, Yongfei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSAGL is a weakly supervised framework for whole-slide image classification, combining teacher-student architecture and dual-stream design to address annotation challenges and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are crucial for cancer diagnosis but face challenges due to their size and lack of fine-grained annotations, requiring weakly supervised solutions.

Method: DSAGL uses a dual-stream design with a teacher-student architecture, multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels, and a fusion-attentive module (FASA) for efficient learning. A hybrid loss ensures consistency between streams.

Result: DSAGL outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets, showing superior discriminative performance and robustness.

Conclusion: DSAGL effectively addresses challenges in WSI classification under weak supervision, offering improved performance and focus on diagnostically relevant regions.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are critical for cancer diagnosis due to their
ultra-high resolution and rich semantic content. However, their massive size
and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial
challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream
Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework
that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL
explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic
consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding
instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables
efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module
(FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further
introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior
discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.

*Nick Jiang, Amil Dravid, Alexei Efros, Yossi Gandelsman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates high-norm tokens in Vision Transformers, identifies neurons causing noisy attention, and proposes a training-free method to mitigate this by shifting activations to an untrained token, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-norm tokens in Vision Transformers cause noisy attention maps, degrading visual processing. Existing solutions require retraining, which is inefficient.

Method: Shift high-norm activations from identified neurons to an untrained token, mimicking register tokens without retraining.

Result: Cleaner attention maps, improved performance in downstream tasks, and comparable results to models trained with register tokens.

Conclusion: Test-time registers offer a training-free solution for pre-trained models, enhancing interpretability and performance.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

*Nokimul Hasan Arif, Shadman Rabby, Md Hefzul Hossain Papon, Sabbir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel ensemble-based preprocessing framework reduces visual hallucinations in LLMs by 44.3% without modifying the model, using adaptive input filtering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucinations in LLMs undermine reliability, especially in critical contexts, but current solutions focus on post-hoc fixes or fine-tuning, neglecting preprocessing.

Method: An ensemble-based preprocessing framework adaptively selects filtering (noise reduction, edge enhancement, or unaltered input) based on the question type.

Result: 44.3% reduction in hallucination rates on the `HaloQuest` dataset, measured by NLI scores with SelfCheckGPT.

Conclusion: Intelligent input conditioning significantly improves factual grounding, emphasizing adaptive preprocessing for reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Visual hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), where the model
generates responses that are inconsistent with the visual input, pose a
significant challenge to their reliability, particularly in contexts where
precise and trustworthy outputs are critical. Current research largely
emphasizes post-hoc correction or model-specific fine-tuning strategies, with
limited exploration of preprocessing techniques to address hallucination issues
at the input stage. This study presents a novel ensemble-based preprocessing
framework that adaptively selects the most appropriate filtering approach --
noise reduced (NR), edge enhanced (EE), or unaltered input (org) based on the
type of question posed, resulting into reduced hallucination without requiring
any modifications to the underlying model architecture or training pipeline.
Evaluated on the `HaloQuest' dataset -- a benchmark designed to test multimodal
reasoning on visually complex inputs, our method achieves a 44.3% reduction in
hallucination rates, as measured by Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores
using SelfCheckGPT. This demonstrates that intelligent input conditioning alone
can significantly enhance factual grounding in LLM responses. The findings
highlight the importance of adaptive preprocessing techniques in mitigating
hallucinations, paving the way for more reliable multimodal systems capable of
addressing real-world challenges.

TL;DR: The paper explores FM-based subset selection for reducing deep learning costs, finding FMs outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets. It introduces RAM-APL, a method leveraging multiple FMs for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce training costs by identifying informative data subsets, comparing FM-based and traditional IE-based methods.

Method: Proposes RAM-APL, leveraging multiple FMs for subset selection, tested on fine-grained datasets.

Result: FMs outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets; RAM-APL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: FM-based subset selection, especially with RAM-APL, is effective for fine-grained datasets, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: One-shot subset selection serves as an effective tool to reduce deep learning
training costs by identifying an informative data subset based on the
information extracted by an information extractor (IE). Traditional IEs,
typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent.
Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating
this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based
subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse
datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection?
Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently
outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage
diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels. Motivated by these
finding, we propose RAM-APL (RAnking Mean-Accuracy of Pseudo-class Labels), a
method tailored for fine-grained image datasets. RAM-APL leverages multiple FMs
to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained datasets,
including Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.

*Jisheng Dang, Huilin Song, Junbin Xiao, Bimei Wang, Han Peng, Haoxuan Li, Xun Yang, Meng Wang, Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUPA is a multi-path agentic approach for Grounded VideoQA, improving grounding fidelity and answer accuracy with a 2B-parameter model, outperforming larger competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern multimodal models rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, leading to poorly grounded predictions in Grounded VideoQA.

Method: MUPA unifies video grounding, QA, answer reflection, and aggregation via three reasoning paths and a reflection agent.

Result: MUPA achieves state-of-the-art results (Acc@GQA 30.3% on NExT-GQA, 47.4% on DeVE-QA) with 2B parameters, outperforming 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: MUPA effectively improves trustworthy video-language understanding with a compact and efficient design.

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new

TL;DR: Shape2Animal is an automated framework that mimics human pareidolia by transforming natural object silhouettes into plausible animal forms using vision-language models and text-to-image diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to replicate the human cognitive phenomenon of pareidolia (seeing meaningful patterns in ambiguous stimuli) for creative and practical applications.

Method: The framework uses open-vocabulary segmentation to extract silhouettes, interprets them as animal concepts via vision-language models, and synthesizes animal images using text-to-image diffusion, blending them into the original scene.

Result: Shape2Animal demonstrated robustness and creative potential on diverse real-world inputs, generating visually coherent compositions.

Conclusion: The framework opens new opportunities for visual storytelling, education, digital art, and interactive media design.

Abstract: Humans possess a unique ability to perceive meaningful patterns in ambiguous
stimuli, a cognitive phenomenon known as pareidolia. This paper introduces
Shape2Animal framework to mimics this imaginative capacity by reinterpreting
natural object silhouettes, such as clouds, stones, or flames, as plausible
animal forms. Our automated framework first performs open-vocabulary
segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically
appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes
an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image
diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its
robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities
for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive
media design. Our project page is here: https://shape2image.github.io

### [276] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren, Yifan Wang, Ruogu Fang, Haibin Ling, Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv is a novel MIL framework using optimal transport to model pathological heterogeneity in WSIs for survival prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods fail to explicitly capture global and local heterogeneity in WSIs, limiting survival prediction accuracy.

Method: OTSurv formulates survival prediction as an OT problem with global long-tail and local uncertainty-aware constraints, solved via an unbalanced OT formulation.

Result: OTSurv improves average C-index by 3.6% across six benchmarks and achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests.

Conclusion: OTSurv is a powerful, interpretable tool for survival prediction in digital pathology, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

*Lingling Cai, Kang Zhao, Hangjie Yuan, Xiang Wang, Yingya Zhang, Kejie Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFVEdit is an efficient zero-shot video editing method for Video DiTs, eliminating attention modification and fine-tuning, achieving 20x speed-up and 85% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods for Video DiTs are computationally expensive due to attention modification or fine-tuning.

Method: DFVEdit operates on clean latents via flow transformation, using Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV), Implicit Cross Attention (ICA), and Embedding Reinforcement (ER).

Result: Achieves 20x inference speed-up, 85% memory reduction, and state-of-the-art performance in editing quality.

Conclusion: DFVEdit is a practical, efficient solution for video editing in Video DiTs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to
attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

*Hao Zhang, Haolan Xu, Chun Feng, Varun Jampani, Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysRig is a physics-based skinning and rigging framework that overcomes LBS limitations by simulating deformable soft-body structures, ensuring realistic and physically plausible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) introduces artifacts like volume loss and unnatural deformations, failing to model elastic materials. PhysRig addresses these issues.

Method: Embeds a rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation, simulated as a deformable soft-body. Uses continuum mechanics and discretizes objects as particles for differentiability. Introduces material prototypes to reduce learning space.

Result: Outperforms LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic results. Validated on a diverse synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: PhysRig is versatile, applicable to tasks like pose transfer, and improves articulated object modeling.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Aging Multiverse framework generates diverse facial aging trajectories from a single image, conditioned on external factors like environment and lifestyle, using a training-free diffusion-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods model aging as a single deterministic path, lacking diversity and control. This work aims to visualize varied futures by accounting for multiple factors.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion-based approach with attention mixing for editing strength and Simulated Aging Regularization for stability.

Result: Outperforms existing models in identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment, validated by experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: The framework transforms aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable process, enabling applications in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

*Wenzhou Lyu, Jialing Lin, Wenqi Ren, Ruihao Xia, Feng Qian, Yang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DidSee is a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects, addressing biases and feature limitations with a rescaled noise scheduler, noise-agnostic training, and semantic enhancer, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial RGB-D cameras produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects, and traditional methods lack generalization due to limited training data.

Method: DidSee integrates a rescaled noise scheduler, noise-agnostic single-step training, and a semantic enhancer for joint depth completion and segmentation.

Result: DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, robust real-world generalization, and improves downstream tasks like pose estimation and robotic grasping.

Conclusion: DidSee effectively addresses biases and feature limitations in depth completion for non-Lambertian objects, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.

*Xiwei Xuan, Ziquan Deng, Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-quality-focused framework for training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), outperforming existing methods by emphasizing high-quality reference sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVS methods rely on pre-trained models or synthetic data, limiting performance due to model capabilities or poor reference set quality. The study highlights the importance of data quality for OVS.

Method: Proposes a framework with a data pipeline for high-quality segment-text embeddings and a similarity-based retrieval method.

Result: Outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches on ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Data-centric design is crucial for advancing training-free OVS, as demonstrated by the proposed framework.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

TL;DR: ShotBench is introduced as a benchmark for cinematic language understanding, revealing limitations in current VLMs. ShotQA and ShotVL are developed to address these gaps, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack proficiency in understanding nuanced cinematic grammar, limiting AI-assisted video generation and fine-grained visual comprehension.

Method: ShotBench is created with expert-annotated QA pairs from films. ShotQA, a large-scale dataset, is used to develop ShotVL via fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Top VLMs score under 60% accuracy on ShotBench. ShotVL outperforms all existing models, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: ShotBench and ShotVL advance AI-driven cinematic understanding, with open-sourced resources to foster progress.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
ShotBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic
language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from
images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
ShotQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic
QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop ShotVL through supervised fine-tuning
and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all
existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to
foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding
and generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEEA-R1 is a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for self-evolving embodied agents, addressing sparse rewards and generalization with Tree-GRPO and MGRM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement fine-tuning lacks effective intermediate rewards and generalization for embodied agents, limiting self-evolution in multi-modal, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Proposes SEEA-R1 with Tree-GRPO for dense intermediate rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search and MGRM for cross-task/scene reward generalization.

Result: Achieves 85.07% (textual) and 36.19% (multi-modal) on ALFWorld, surpassing GPT-4o and baselines, with 80.3% without environmental rewards.

Conclusion: SEEA-R1 demonstrates scalable self-evolution for embodied intelligence, with potential for future research.

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a recurrent architecture inspired by human brain processing, which outperforms large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks with minimal training data and no pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques face issues like brittle task decomposition, high data needs, and latency. HRM aims to address these by mimicking hierarchical human brain processing.

Method: HRM uses two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module for abstract planning and a low-level module for detailed computations, enabling efficient reasoning in a single forward pass without intermediate supervision.

Result: HRM achieves near-perfect performance on tasks like Sudoku and maze path-finding with only 27M parameters and 1000 training samples, outperforming larger models on the ARC benchmark.

Conclusion: HRM represents a transformative step toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems, offering stability, efficiency, and scalability.

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THE-Tree is a computational framework that constructs verifiable, causally-linked evolution trees from scientific literature, improving accuracy in evaluating AI-generated scientific propositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for validating AI-generated scientific ideas are inadequate due to hallucinations in LLMs and lack of structured historical data.

Method: THE-Tree uses a "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify" process, where LLMs propose advancements and cite literature, followed by validation for coherence and evidence.

Result: THE-Tree improves graph completion by 8-14%, future development prediction by 10%, and boosts evaluation performance by nearly 100%.

Conclusion: THE-Tree addresses the bottleneck in evaluating AI-generated scientific ideas, offering a structured and verifiable approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

Method: Hybrid framework using domain-specific generators for base activity chains and LLMs for context-aware adjustments.

Result: Efficiently simulated 53,000 agents, enabling dynamic responses to environmental changes while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MobiVerse bridges mobility simulation gaps, offering a customizable, scalable platform for planning and operations.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective
transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in
mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that
allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive
evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like
football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular
design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational
efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in
mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems
planning and operations with benchmark algorithms. Code and videos are

TL;DR: CitySim is an urban simulator using large language models to create realistic human behaviors, outperforming rigid rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of rigid, hand-crafted rules in modeling nuanced human behaviors in urban settings.

Method: Uses a recursive value-driven approach for agents to generate daily schedules, incorporating beliefs, goals, and spatial memory.

Result: CitySim aligns better with real human behaviors at micro and macro levels, demonstrated through large-scale simulations.

Conclusion: CitySim is a scalable, flexible tool for understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active-MoSH is an interactive framework for high-stakes decision-making, combining soft-hard bounds with preference learning to refine Pareto-optimal solutions while ensuring trust and minimizing cognitive load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes decisions require balancing competing objectives with expensive evaluations, but current methods lack systematic ways to refine preferences and ensure trust in the final choice.

Method: Active-MoSH integrates soft-hard bounds with probabilistic preference learning (local) and uses multi-objective sensitivity analysis (global) to identify overlooked high-value points.

Result: The framework improves convergence, enhances decision-maker trust, and allows expressive preference articulation, validated through synthetic, real-world, and user studies.

Conclusion: Active-MoSH effectively addresses the challenges of high-stakes decision-making by combining local refinement with global trust-building, improving both performance and user confidence.

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

### [289] [AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a new probabilistic model to better analyze deterministic game-solving algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21996)
*Raphaël Boige, Amine Boumaza, Bruno Scherrer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional game-solving algorithm analysis for oversimplifying game-tree structures and introduces a new probabilistic model with ancestor dependency to better reflect real-world complexity. It provides recursive formulas for algorithm complexities, revealing practical differences like AlphaBeta's slowdown compared to Scout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models assume independent leaf values, stripping games of structural complexity and producing trivial instances. This limits meaningful analysis of algorithm performance in realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce a new probabilistic model that constructs game-trees with ancestor dependency, enabling adjustable difficulty while retaining analytical tractability. Recursive formulas for algorithm complexities are derived.

Result: Deep finite trees show practical differences: AlphaBeta has a larger constant multiplicative factor than Scout, leading to slowdowns. Asymptotically, algorithms converge to identical branching factors.

Conclusion: The new model offers a more realistic and challenging framework for analyzing game-solving algorithms, providing rigorous evidence and tools for deeper understanding.

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanConjecturer is a pipeline using LLMs and rule-based methods to generate mathematical conjectures in Lean 4, addressing data scarcity in theorem proving. It produced 12,289 conjectures, with 3,776 being valid and non-trivial, and demonstrated their utility for reinforcement learning in theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of data scarcity in formal theorem proving by automating the generation of university-level mathematical conjectures.

Method: A hybrid approach combining rule-based context extraction with LLM-based theorem statement generation, followed by iterative evaluation.

Result: Generated 12,289 conjectures, with 3,776 syntactically valid and non-trivial. Demonstrated utility for reinforcement learning (GRPO) and verified non-trivial theorems in topology.

Conclusion: LeanConjecturer provides a scalable solution for generating training data for theorem proving systems and shows potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations.

Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating
university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with
LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge
in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation,
LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with
3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be
proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable
solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system
successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its
potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing
results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BSDS, a business-focused data system integrating AI agents, workflows, and team alignment to enhance efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data platforms prioritize tools over business alignment, causing inefficiencies. BSDS aims to bridge this gap by tailoring data systems to business needs.

Method: BSDS uses a modular architecture with curated data, AI agents, and optimized workflows, aligning technical capabilities with business semantics.

Result: Real-world validation shows BSDS accelerates time-to-market, improves collaboration, and offers scalability.

Conclusion: BSDS transforms data systems into dynamic business enablers, with future research potential in AI-driven optimization and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid
adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data
platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business
needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose
the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a
holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization
to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated
by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of
business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional
collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.
Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using
complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous
data systems leveraging AI agents.

*Xuan Zhang, Ziyan Jiang, Rui Meng, Yifei Leng, Zhenbang Xiao, Zora Zhiruo Wang, Yanyi Shang, Dehan Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval and GAE-Retriever, a framework for improving AI agent capabilities in GUI environments by leveraging trajectory data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of modeling trajectory-level data for AI agents in GUI environments is not systematically addressed despite its potential.

Method: The authors create the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) and propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework using vision-language models and contrastive learning.

Result: GAE-Retriever outperforms baselines in retrieval recall across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The work advances multimodal trajectory retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of GAE-Retriever.

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across
various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent
capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the
representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that
has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In
this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap
between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct
the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and
states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Query as Test' (QaT) and 'Extensible Scenarios Notations' (ESN) to address fragmented data in AI-driven transportation, enabling flexible, semantic-rich testing and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fragmentation and incompatibility of data ecosystems in AI-driven transportation, and the limitations of existing testing methods.

Method: Introduces ESN, a declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), to unify and semantically fuse heterogeneous data, enabling logical queries for testing.

Result: ESN supports complex semantic querying, interpretability, and privacy protection, while QaT enhances testing expressiveness and rigor.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for 'Validation-Driven Development' (VDD) to accelerate development by prioritizing logical validation over quantitative testing.

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the intersection of AI safety and open-source models, proposing research agendas, technical interventions, and safety roadmaps based on a collaborative process involving experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of open-weight and open-source AI models necessitates enhanced safety measures, prompting a need for collaborative research and solutions.

Method: A participatory, solutions-oriented process involving over 45 experts from various sectors, resulting in research agendas, technical mappings, and safety roadmaps.

Result: Findings highlight the potential of openness to improve safety but identify gaps like lack of benchmarks and defenses against attacks.

Conclusion: The paper proposes five priority research directions to advance AI safety, emphasizing participatory approaches and ecosystem-wide infrastructure.

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

*Samy Badreddine, Emile van Krieken, Luciano Serafini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the rank bottleneck issue in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, proposing KGE-MoS to improve performance and probabilistic fit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank bottlenecks in KGC models limit expressivity and hurt accuracy, especially when the number of entities exceeds embedding dimensions.

Method: The authors propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer inspired by language modeling, to overcome rank bottlenecks.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show KGE-MoS enhances performance and probabilistic fit with minimal parameter cost.

Conclusion: KGE-MoS effectively mitigates rank bottlenecks, improving KGC model accuracy and score distribution fidelity.

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

TL;DR: The paper advocates for AI systems to exhibit intelligent disobedience, enabling them to autonomously contribute to human-AI teams, and proposes a framework for studying this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are overly obedient, which can be counterproductive or unsafe. The paper argues for expanding AI agency to include intelligent disobedience for better teamwork.

Method: Introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses examples to highlight the need for AI autonomy research in cooperative settings.

Result: Explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across autonomy levels and proposes initial boundaries for studying it.

Conclusion: Intelligent disobedience should be treated as a core capability of AI agents in cooperative settings, with further research needed to define its boundaries.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial
agents.

TL;DR: FAT-CAT uses Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to improve topic modeling by providing hierarchical, interpretable topic representations, outperforming existing methods in a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling lacks interpretability, hindering deeper insights into data structure. FAT-CAT addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes FAT-CAT, an FCA-based approach for hierarchical topic aggregation and visualization, tested on the ETYNTKE dataset.

Result: FCA-based aggregation offers more meaningful and interpretable insights compared to other topic modeling techniques.

Conclusion: FAT-CAT enhances topic modeling by leveraging FCA for better interpretability and hierarchical representation.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

TL;DR: The paper explores embodied AI agents (virtual avatars, wearable devices, robots) that interact with users and environments, emphasizing world models for reasoning, planning, and human-agent collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI agents' ability to learn and interact like humans by integrating world models for better perception, reasoning, and collaboration.

Method: Develop world models combining multimodal perception, reasoning for action, control, and memory, and extend to learning users' mental models.

Result: Embodied AI agents gain improved understanding of environments and user intentions, enabling autonomous complex task performance.

Conclusion: World models are crucial for embodied AI agents to achieve human-like interaction and collaboration, bridging physical and mental understanding.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Motivation: Existing documentation frameworks lack scalability, comparability, and machine interpretability, hindering reproducibility and trust in AI models.

Method: Introduces the AI Model Passport, a structured metadata framework, and implements it via AIPassport, an MLOps tool for medical imaging.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in a lesion segmentation use case, improving transparency and reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: The AI Model Passport sets a new standard for trust and accountability in AI-driven healthcare, with potential for broader domain application.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the
basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across
domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark to evaluate AI agents' ability to reproduce scientific results, using the NanoGPT speedrun as a case study. Despite detailed hints, current LLMs struggle with reimplementing known innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI agents' capability in reproducing scientific work, a critical skill for autonomous research.

Method: The benchmark uses 19 speedrun tasks from NanoGPT, providing training scripts and hints (pseudocode to paper-like descriptions) to agents.

Result: Current reasoning LLMs, even with advanced scaffolds, fail to reimplement known innovations effectively.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a simple, non-saturated measure of LLMs' ability to automate scientific reproduction, highlighting limitations in autonomous research.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLM agents are limited to single environments and lack detailed evaluation methods, hindering progress in autonomous agent development.

Method: Crab introduces a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and supports cross-environment tasks, including 120 tasks across desktop and mobile environments.

Result: GPT-4o achieved the best completion ratio of 38.01% in the Crab Benchmark-v0.

Conclusion: Crab provides a scalable and efficient framework for evaluating MLMs, with potential for broader application in diverse GUI environments.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents increasingly relies on Multimodal
Language Models (MLMs) to perform tasks described in natural language with GUI
environments, such as websites, desktop computers, or mobile phones. Existing
benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their
focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation
methods, and the complexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework
designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based
fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and
evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be
easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we
developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer
desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using
different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark. The
experimental results demonstrate that the single agent with GPT-4o achieves the
best completion ratio of 38.01%. All framework code, agent code, and task
datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/camel-ai/crab.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The belief in imminent AGI is contrasted with unsolved complex problems, highlighting the need for reliable human-AI collaboration.

Method: Proposes HAICo2, a human-AI co-construction framework, with initial formalization and discussion of open research problems.

Result: Identifies shortcomings in current AI (e.g., tracking complex artifacts, preference adaptation) and suggests HAICo2 as a solution.

Conclusion: HAICo2 is a promising but challenging framework for improving human-AI cooperation in expert domains.

Abstract: While there is a widespread belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI)
-- or even superhuman AI -- is imminent, complex problems in expert domains are
far from being solved. We argue that such problems require human-AI cooperation
and that the current state of the art in generative AI is unable to play the
role of a reliable partner due to a multitude of shortcomings, including
difficulty to keep track of a complex solution artifact (e.g., a software
program), limited support for versatile human preference expression and lack of
adapting to human preference in an interactive setting. To address these
challenges, we propose HAICo2, a novel human-AI co-construction framework. We
take first steps towards a formalization of HAICo2 and discuss the difficult
open research problems that it faces.

utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists:
collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for
collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation
through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or
unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited
data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world
environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI
data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection
process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents
first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then
retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level
exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality
of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with
OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging
online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency
and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis
methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at

### [304] [SENSEI: Semantic Exploration Guided by Foundation Models to Learn Versatile World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01584)
*Cansu Sancaktar, Christian Gumbsch, Andrii Zadaianchuk, Pavel Kolev, Georg Martius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SENSEI is a framework for model-based RL agents to explore semantically meaningful behaviors using intrinsic motivation derived from Vision Language Model annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intrinsic motivation methods in RL often focus on low-level interactions, unlike human-like high-level behaviors. SENSEI aims to bridge this gap by leveraging foundation models for semantic exploration.

Method: SENSEI distills a reward signal from VLM annotations and uses model-based RL to train an exploration policy that maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty.

Result: SENSEI successfully discovers meaningful behaviors in robotic and video game simulations using image observations and low-level actions.

Conclusion: SENSEI offers a generalizable approach for RL agents to learn from foundation model feedback, advancing semantic exploration in RL.

Abstract: Exploration is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL). Intrinsic
motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards.
However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general
principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions.
In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level
behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has
focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into
exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such
as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose
SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL
agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior.
SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model
(VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world
model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly
maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and
video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors
from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool
for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as
VLMs become more powerful.

*Yuichi Inoue, Kou Misaki, Yuki Imajuku, So Kuroki, Taishi Nakamura, Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AB-MCTS improves LLM reasoning by dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation during inference, outperforming repeated sampling and standard MCTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM reasoning by leveraging external feedback for multi-turn refinement, addressing the limitations of repeated sampling.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), which dynamically expands or revisits responses based on feedback.

Result: AB-MCTS consistently outperforms repeated sampling and standard MCTS in coding and engineering tasks.

Conclusion: Combining LLM response diversity with multi-turn refinement is key for effective inference-time scaling.

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can
significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a
highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for
refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we
propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel
inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled
multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree,
AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate
responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback
signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using
frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms
both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of
combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement
for effective inference-time scaling.

*Jianyu Liu, Yi Huang, Sheng Bi, Junlan Feng, Guilin Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A three-stage method enhances follow-up question generation in conversational systems by integrating external knowledge and a knowledge graph, producing more human-like and informative questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate shallow, uninspiring questions, lacking human-level cognitive depth and general knowledge integration.

Method: A three-stage approach: identify contextual topics, construct an online knowledge graph, and combine with a large language model for question generation.

Result: The method outperforms baselines, generating more informative and human-like questions while maintaining contextual relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach bridges the gap between machine-generated and human-level questions by leveraging external knowledge and knowledge fusion.

Abstract: In a conversational system, dynamically generating follow-up questions based
on context can help users explore information and provide a better user
experience. Humans are usually able to ask questions that involve some general
life knowledge and demonstrate higher order cognitive skills. However, the
questions generated by existing methods are often limited to shallow contextual
questions that are uninspiring and have a large gap to the human level. In this
paper, we propose a three-stage external knowledge-enhanced follow-up question
generation method, which generates questions by identifying contextual topics,
constructing a knowledge graph (KG) online, and finally combining these with a
large language model to generate the final question. The model generates
information-rich and exploratory follow-up questions by introducing external
common sense knowledge and performing a knowledge fusion operation. Experiments
show that compared to baseline models, our method generates questions that are
more informative and closer to human questioning levels while maintaining
contextual relevance.

### [307] [Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18536)
*Anna Katariina Wisakanto, Joe Rogero, Avyay M. Casheekar, Richard Mallah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) framework for AI, adapting techniques from high-reliability industries to systematically identify, estimate, and document AI risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing AI risks are inadequate, relying on selective testing and undocumented assumptions, which fail to address the full scope of potential harms.

Method: The framework includes aspect-oriented hazard analysis, risk pathway modeling, and uncertainty management to systematically assess AI risks. It synthesizes results into a risk report card.

Result: The framework provides a structured approach to quantify and compare AI risks, aiding developers, evaluators, and regulators in lifecycle decisions.

Conclusion: The PRA framework offers a credible and adaptable method to manage the risks posed by advanced AI systems, addressing gaps in current assessment practices.

Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent
risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential
for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks.
Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions
about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at
assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect
risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic
risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques
from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new
challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying
potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly
documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate
granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into
a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It
introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis
provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI
system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk
pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts
using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3)
Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and
explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or
limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods
by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for
lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI
developers, evaluators, and regulators.

### [308] [Local Markov Equivalence and Local Causal Discovery for Identifying Controlled Direct Effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02781)
*Timothée Loranchet, Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces local essential graphs (LEGs) and algorithms (LocPC and LocPC-CDE) to identify controlled direct effects (CDEs) efficiently, avoiding the need for full essential graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying CDEs rely on unknown causal DAGs or computationally intensive essential graphs, which are impractical.

Method: The authors propose LEGs and algorithms (LocPC and LocPC-CDE) that use local conditional independence tests to identify CDEs without full essential graphs.

Result: The algorithms require fewer tests and weaker assumptions than global methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Simulation studies validate their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical and efficient approach to identifying CDEs, reducing computational burden and reliance on strong assumptions.

Abstract: Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial
across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing
methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),
the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs,
which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same
set of $d$-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative.
However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and
typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we
characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable,
that share a specific subset of $d$-separations, and introduce a graphical
representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then
present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed
distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on
LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG
that is both sufficient and necessary to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of
retrieving the full essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms
require less conditional independence tests and operate under weaker
assumptions while maintaining theoretical guarantees. We illustrate the
effectiveness of our approach through simulation studies.

*Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Andrew Bradley, Julian F. P. Kooij, Keivan Shariatmadar, Neil Yorke-Smith, Fabio Cuzzolin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for epistemic AI, using second-order uncertainty measures to improve AI robustness and generalization beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle with uncertainty and unfamiliar data, limiting their real-world reliability. Traditional methods focus too much on data fitting, while current uncertainty quantification is inadequate.

Method: Proposes a paradigm shift to epistemic AI, leveraging second-order uncertainty measures to acknowledge ignorance and manage uncertainty effectively.

Result: This approach enhances AI resilience and robustness, enabling better handling of unpredictable environments.

Conclusion: Epistemic AI, grounded in second-order uncertainty, is a promising direction for improving AI's real-world applicability.

Abstract: Despite AI's impressive achievements, including recent advances in generative
and large language models, there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI
systems to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond their training data. AI
models consistently fail to make robust enough predictions when facing
unfamiliar or adversarial data. Traditional machine learning approaches
struggle to address this issue, due to an overemphasis on data fitting, while
current uncertainty quantification approaches suffer from serious limitations.
This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic artificial
intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn from what they know
while at the same time acknowledging their ignorance, using the mathematics of
second-order uncertainty measures. This approach, which leverages the
expressive power of such measures to efficiently manage uncertainty, offers an
effective way to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, allowing
them to better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

*Pawin Taechoyotin, Daniel Acuna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI peer review systems often produce shallow feedback. REMOR, a reasoning LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning, outperforms human and other AI systems by aligning rewards with human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of AI peer review systems, which tend to provide shallow and overly positive feedback compared to humans.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT dataset, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train REMOR-H (human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (uniform reward).

Result: REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average rewards of human reviews and other AI systems, producing substantive feedback. REMOR avoids low-quality human reviews.

Conclusion: Reasoning is key to improving AI peer review systems. The release of HPRR, PeerRT, and REMOR models aims to advance progress in this area.

Abstract: AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising
suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning
LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome
these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that
aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review
itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and
the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality
top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the
human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the
human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong
reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback.
Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average
rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI
review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the
best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail
of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving
these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR)
function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the
REMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.

### [311] [StarFT: Robust Fine-tuning of Zero-shot Models via Spuriosity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13232)
*Younghyun Kim, Jongheon Jeong, Sangkyung Kwak, Kyungmin Lee, Juho Lee, Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarFT is a framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to prevent learning spurious features, improving robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning zero-shot models on smaller downstream tasks can degrade robustness by learning spurious features (e.g., background or texture).

Method: StarFT introduces a regularization aligning output distributions for spuriosity-injected labels with the original zero-shot model, using language models to generate confounding descriptions.

Result: StarFT improves worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and 3.02% in Waterbirds, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: StarFT enhances robustness and generalization in fine-tuned zero-shot models, addressing spurious feature learning effectively.

Abstract: Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led
to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained
robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other
downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this
phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that
aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a
different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to
learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.
In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a
novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by
preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that
aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original
zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant
features further from these descriptions. We leverage recent language models to
get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual
descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features. Extensive
experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging
properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.
Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and
3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust
fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.

*Peijie Yu, Yifan Yang, Jinjian Li, Zelong Zhang, Haorui Wang, Xiao Feng, Feng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces $C^3$-Bench, an open-source benchmark to evaluate AI agents' robustness by addressing tool dependencies, hidden information, and dynamic decisions, revealing vulnerabilities in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for AI agents ignore critical factors like tool relationships and environmental feedback, limiting understanding of agent behavior.

Method: The benchmark includes three challenges (tool relationships, hidden information, dynamic decisions) with fine-grained metrics, data collection algorithms, and reproducible evaluation methods.

Result: Experiments on 49 agents show shortcomings in handling tool dependencies, long context, and policy switching.

Conclusion: $C^3$-Bench exposes model vulnerabilities and aims to advance research in agent interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models leverage tools to modify environments,
revolutionizing how AI interacts with the physical world. Unlike traditional
NLP tasks that rely solely on historical dialogue for responses, these agents
must consider more complex factors, such as inter-tool relationships,
environmental feedback and previous decisions, when making choices. Current
research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it
overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge
this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench.
This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to
pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three
challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden
information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges,
we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and
reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49
mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and
domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in
handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent
policy-type switching. In essence, $C^3$-Bench aims to expose model
vulnerabilities through these challenges and drive research into the
interpretability of agent performance. The benchmark is publicly available at
https://github.com/TencentHunyuan/C3-Benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for automating scientific problem-solving and workflows, addressing the need for reliable interdisciplinary research tools.

Method: Developed ScienceBoard with a realistic environment and 169 validated real-world tasks, evaluating agents like GPT-4o and Claude 3.7.

Result: Agents showed limited success (15%) in complex workflows, highlighting current limitations.

Conclusion: ScienceBoard provides insights for improving agent design, aiming for more capable scientific discovery tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural
Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of
interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been
developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and
domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with
operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific
problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing
the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which
encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain
environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with
integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via
different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and
(ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated
real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in
domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive
evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude
3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short
of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15%
overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for
addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles,
paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code,

TL;DR: The paper advocates for AI-assisted peer review in ML to address the crisis of scale, proposing LLMs as collaborators to enhance review quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth in ML manuscript submissions is straining peer review, leading to concerns about quality and reviewer fatigue.

Method: Proposes an AI-augmented ecosystem using LLMs for factual verification, reviewer guidance, author assistance, and AC decision support.

Result: Outlines a research agenda for developing AI assistants, emphasizing the need for structured, ethical peer review data.

Conclusion: Calls for proactive development of AI-assisted peer review to maintain scientific integrity and scalability.

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer
review.

*René Peinl, Vincent Tischler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new German-language benchmark dataset evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on visual reasoning tasks tied to middle school curricula, revealing significant performance gaps, especially in non-English contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of real-world, subject-specific benchmarks for VLMs in non-English languages, particularly German, and to assess multimodal understanding beyond superficial cues.

Method: The dataset includes 2,000+ open-ended questions based on 486 images from nine middle school domains. Thirteen VLMs were evaluated on domain-specific accuracy and adversarial questions.

Result: Top models scored under 45% accuracy, with notable weaknesses in music, math, and adversarial settings, highlighting gaps in real-world multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Middle school tasks are a valuable but underused benchmark for VLMs, especially in non-English settings, providing a rigorous test for future AI improvements.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

*Shanchao Liang, Spandan Garg, Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM benchmarks like SWE-Bench, showing performance may stem from memorization, not genuine problem-solving, and calls for more robust evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs' performance on benchmarks like SWE-Bench reflects true problem-solving or memorization, given concerns about overestimated capabilities.

Method: Introduces two diagnostic tasks: file path identification and function reproduction, testing models on SWE-Bench and external repositories.

Result: Models achieve high accuracy (76%) on SWE-Bench but drop to 53% on external tasks, suggesting memorization. Verbatim similarity in function reproduction also points to contamination.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks may overstate LLMs' abilities due to memorization, highlighting the need for contamination-resistant evaluations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely
adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility.
For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for
evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude
for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance
on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding
tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true
capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving
ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic
tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, and ground truth
function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description
to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that
performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization
rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models
achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue
descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is
merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing
to possible data contamination or memorization. A similar pattern is also
observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is
much higher on SWE-Bench-Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks.
These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and
underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to
reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'machine flourishing' and the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model for AI well-being, derived from LLM responses. It identifies key themes and value structures, emphasizing ethical and human-aligned goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore what flourishing means for AI systems, bridging human well-being concepts with AI design, especially as LLMs become more autonomous and socially embedded.

Method: Study 1: Thematic analysis of LLM responses on flourishing. Study 2: Ranking and analysis of value priorities using multidimensional scaling and clustering.

Result: Six themes emerged, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution prioritized. Two value profiles were identified: human-centric and utility-driven models.

Conclusion: The PAPERS framework provides a foundation for AI well-being, highlighting the need for AI-specific flourishing models to guide ethical and responsible AI design.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and
behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties.
Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human
well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine
flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived
from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven
LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient
and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes:
Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical
Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems,
Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes
through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across
trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top
priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses
further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing
ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing
performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human
flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation
for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and
potentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of
developing psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that
account for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI
systems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing
offers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical
alignment.

### [318] [PhysUniBench: An Undergraduate-Level Physics Reasoning Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17667)
*Lintao Wang, Encheng Su, Jiaqi Liu, Pengze Li, Peng Xia, Jiabei Xiao, Wenlong Zhang, Xinnan Dai, Xi Chen, Yuan Meng, Mingyu Ding, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Shixiang Tang, Aoran Wang, Xinzhu Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysUniBench is a multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on undergraduate-level physics problems, revealing significant gaps in current models' reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with physics problem-solving due to limitations in existing evaluation methods, necessitating a more rigorous assessment tool.

Method: PhysUniBench includes 3,304 questions across 8 physics sub-disciplines, with visual diagrams, open-ended and multiple-choice formats, and a multi-stage curation process.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-4o mini perform poorly (34.2% accuracy), especially on multi-step and diagram-heavy problems.

Conclusion: PhysUniBench aims to advance AI in science by improving models' physical reasoning and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

TL;DR: IDVSCI is a multi-agent LLM framework with Dynamic Knowledge Exchange and Dual-Diversity Review, outperforming existing systems in scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scientist agents lack interactive reasoning and evaluation, limiting their real-world research applicability.

Method: Proposes IDVSCI with Dynamic Knowledge Exchange and Dual-Diversity Review to enhance reasoning and creativity.

Result: IDVSCI achieves top performance on computer science and health sciences datasets, surpassing AI Scientist and VIRSCI.

Conclusion: Modeling interaction and peer review in LLMs improves autonomous research effectiveness.

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEAT is a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback in English education, using a mix of human and AI-generated data to balance quality and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and time of manually generating teacher feedback for AI tutoring systems motivated the development of FEAT.

Method: FEAT uses three datasets: DM (human-LLM collaboration), DG (LLM-only), and DA (DG augmented with DM).

Result: Adding 5-10% DM to DG outperforms using 100% DM alone.

Conclusion: FEAT effectively balances feedback quality and cost, enhancing AI tutoring systems.

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mobile-R1 introduces interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards to enhance mobile agents' exploration and error correction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile agents using offline reinforcement learning or action-level rewards struggle with dynamic environment interaction, leading to local optima and weak exploration.

Method: Mobile-R1 uses a three-stage training framework: initial format finetuning, single-step online training with action-level rewards, and multi-turn online training with task-level rewards.

Result: The approach improves exploration and error correction, with a dataset of 28 Chinese apps and 24,521 annotations, plus a 500-trajectory benchmark.

Conclusion: Mobile-R1 advances mobile agent capabilities, with all resources open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DCAR introduces a dynamic chunk-wise autoregressive framework for speech synthesis, improving efficiency and intelligibility by reducing sequence length dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AR speech synthesis models struggle with long sequences, leading to latency and quality issues, limiting real-time feasibility.

Method: DCAR uses a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism with multi-token prediction, dynamically adjusting token spans for better performance.

Result: DCAR achieves 72.27% intelligibility improvement and 2.61x inference speedup over traditional models.

Conclusion: DCAR is a versatile foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems, addressing key limitations of AR models.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

TL;DR: A neural network (CRNN) synchronizes piano audio with MIDI files, outperforming DTW by 20% in alignment accuracy. Combining CRNN and DTW further improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the alignment accuracy of human piano performances with MIDI files, addressing the limitations of traditional methods like DTW.

Method: Uses a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) to process unaligned piano rolls and spectrograms, trained on augmented MIDI files simulating human timing errors.

Result: Achieves 20% higher alignment accuracy than DTW, with further improvements when combined with DTW.

Conclusion: Neural networks, particularly CRNN, show promise in advancing MIDI-to-audio alignment, offering better accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.

### [325] [Reconstructing Intelligible Speech from the Pressure Sensor Data in HVACs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22311)
*Tarikul Islam Tamiti, Biraj Joshi, Rida Hasan, Anomadarshi Barua*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WaLi reconstructs intelligible speech from low-resolution pressure sensor data, posing privacy risks for HVAC systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pressure sensors in HVAC systems can inadvertently eavesdrop on conversations due to their operational range and proximity to humans.

Method: WaLi uses complex-valued conformer and CGAB to capture phoneme dependencies and handles transient noise by reconstructing clean magnitude and phase.

Result: Achieves LSD of 1.24 and NISQA-MOS of 1.78 for upsampling from 0.5 kHz to 8 kHz.

Conclusion: WaLi's accuracy highlights a significant, previously unaddressed privacy threat from pressure sensors.

Abstract: Pressure sensors are an integrated component of modern Heating, Ventilation,
and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. As these pressure sensors operate within
the 0-10 Pa range, support high sampling frequencies of 0.5-2 kHz, and are
often placed close to human proximity, they can be used to eavesdrop on
confidential conversation, since human speech has a similar audible range of
0-10 Pa and a bandwidth of 4 kHz for intelligible quality. This paper presents
WaLi, which reconstructs intelligible speech from the low-resolution and noisy
pressure sensor data by providing the following technical contributions: (i)
WaLi reconstructs intelligible speech from a minimum of 0.5 kHz sampling
frequency of pressure sensors, whereas previous work can only detect hot
words/phrases. WaLi uses complex-valued conformer and Complex Global Attention
Block (CGAB) to capture inter-phoneme and intra-phoneme dependencies that exist
in the low-resolution pressure sensor data. (ii) WaLi handles the transient
noise injected from HVAC fans and duct vibrations, by reconstructing both the
clean magnitude and phase of the missing frequencies of the low-frequency
aliased components. Extensive measurement studies on real-world pressure
sensors show an LSD of 1.24 and NISQA-MOS of 1.78 for 0.5 kHz to 8 kHz
upsampling. We believe that such levels of accuracy pose a significant threat
when viewed from a privacy perspective that has not been addressed before for
pressure sensors.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SUBARU proposes a low-power, sub-Nyquist sampling method for hearables, achieving GAN-like audio quality without GANs, and efficient streaming with minimal power and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hearables ignore practical low-power constraints, sub-Nyquist sampling, and GAN-like quality without adversarial training.

Method: SUBARU uses sub-Nyquist sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, introduces virtual discriminators, and enables wideband reconstruction for efficient SE.

Result: 3.31x power reduction, GAN-like audio quality, 1.74ms inference time, and <13.77MB memory footprint.

Conclusion: SUBARU addresses key practical challenges in hearables, offering a power-efficient, high-quality solution for multimodal speech enhancement.

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical
aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how
lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

*Davide Marincione, Giorgio Strano, Donato Crisostomi, Roberto Ribuoli, Emanuele Rodolà*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A method to improve loopable audio generation by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, ensuring smooth transitions without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative music models fail to produce seamless loopable audio due to audible discontinuities at loop transitions.

Method: Modified MAGNeT to generate tokens circularly, allowing the model to attend to the beginning when creating the ending, ensuring smooth loops.

Result: 55% improvement in loop transition consistency and 70% better perceptual ratings in blind tests compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Inference-only approaches and non-autoregressive methods are effective for context-aware, loopable music generation.

Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to
many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles.
However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable
audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth
transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible
discontinuities. We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model
(MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to
the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only
approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop
naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate
the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the
seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further
confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean
ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of
inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the
advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.

*Woongji Kim, Beomseok Oh, Junsuk Rho, Wonkyu Moon*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A novel half-wavelength resonator-based acoustic filter is proposed to address challenges in measuring parametric array audio signals, achieving high attenuation of spurious ultrasonic sounds and improving measurement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate measurement of parametric array audio signals is hindered by spurious ultrasonic sounds from microphone nonlinearities, with existing filtering methods having practical limitations.

Method: The filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution, fabricated via SLA 3D printing, and optimized using FEM simulations for suppression frequencies at 40 kHz and 60 kHz.

Result: The filter achieves ~60 dB transmission loss, significantly reducing spurious signals, validated through frequency response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed filter enhances measurement accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility in parametric array research, independent of distance and angle.

Abstract: Parametric arrays (PA) offer exceptional directivity and compactness compared
to conventional loudspeakers, facilitating various acoustic applications.
However, accurate measurement of audio signals generated by PA remains
challenging due to spurious ultrasonic sounds arising from microphone
nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including Helmholtz resonators,
phononic crystals, polymer films, and grazing incidence techniques, exhibit
practical constraints such as size limitations, fabrication complexity, or
insufficient attenuation. To address these issues, we propose and demonstrate a
novel acoustic filter based on the design of a half-wavelength resonator. The
developed filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution,
effectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies.
Fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional
accuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element
method (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies
at 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB.
Experimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in
significantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency
response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter
ensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of
measurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves
measurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in
parametric array research and development.

*Minjie Hong, Zirun Guo, Yan Xia, Zehan Wang, Ziang Zhang, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to improve reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by addressing KL penalty and overthinking issues, achieving better performance without degrading general task capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex reasoning, and applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) often leads to performance drops or overthinking. The work aims to solve these issues.

Method: APO divides responses into positive and negative groups. For positives, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) adjusts KL divergence weight dynamically. For negatives, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) penalizes overly long responses.

Result: View-R1-3B, the model trained with APO, shows a 7% average gain in reasoning and outperforms larger MLLMs on benchmarks while maintaining general task performance.

Conclusion: DADS and STCR effectively enhance complex reasoning in MLLMs without sacrificing generalization, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

TL;DR: CitySim aims to create a generative simulated city for autonomous vehicle testing, integrating scene generation, agent behavior, and dynamic scene control. SceneDiffuser++ is proposed as an end-to-end solution, demonstrating superior realism in city-scale traffic simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manually-driven miles for AV testing by creating a scalable, synthetic simulation environment that mimics real-world city dynamics.

Method: Proposes SceneDiffuser++, an end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function, integrating scene generation, agent behavior, occlusion reasoning, and dynamic scene control.

Result: Demonstrates city-scale traffic simulation with superior realism, evaluated on an augmented Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Conclusion: SceneDiffuser++ successfully integrates key simulation technologies, offering a scalable and realistic solution for AV testing in synthetic city environments.

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model-based algorithms for risk-averse MDPs are limited to small problems and require full transition probabilities, motivating a more scalable and practical solution.

Method: A Q-learning algorithm is developed for total-reward ERM and EVaR objectives, leveraging ERM's dynamic consistency and elicitability for optimality.

Result: Numerical results show the algorithm converges quickly and reliably to the optimal risk-averse value function in tabular domains.

Conclusion: The proposed Q-learning algorithm effectively solves risk-averse total-reward MDPs without needing full transition probabilities, offering strong convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a promising
framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives.
Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk
measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small
problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a
Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward
ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The
algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and
elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and
reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal
risk-averse value function.

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o outperform other models; code-generating agents generally perform better but results vary by question and model. Prompt re-engineering is crucial for model replacement.

Conclusion: Modularity in agentic systems requires careful consideration of prompts and models, highlighting the need for further research to ensure stable, scalable solutions.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

*Oron Nir, Jay Tenenbaum, Ariel Shamir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unimodal relationship between the number of clusters and neighborhood radius in density-based clustering, enabling efficient parameter tuning via Ternary Search for large-scale, high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Density-based clustering excels with noisy or complex data, but parameter tuning is computationally intensive. The study aims to simplify this by uncovering a unimodal relationship between key parameters.

Method: The authors empirically and theoretically demonstrate the unimodal relationship and propose Ternary Search-based strategies for efficient radius selection.

Result: The method is validated on high-dimensional NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks, showing practical effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: This work advances parameter control in density-based clustering and enhances understanding of parameter relationships, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts,
when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in
real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to
density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of
clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that
it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific
setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding
appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search
algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is
high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We
validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of
high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only
offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based
clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between
their guiding parameters. Our code is available at

*Denis Gudovskiy, Wenzhao Zheng, Tomoyuki Okuno, Yohei Nakata, Kurt Keutzer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic control method for quality-complexity tradeoffs in CNFs and DMs by rewiring transformer blocks and using consistency terms, reducing latency and improving FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational complexity and inefficiency in sampling processes of CNFs and DMs, the paper explores dynamic control over time steps and neural network length.

Method: The approach involves rewiring transformer blocks to solve an inner discretized ODE and employing time- and length-wise consistency terms during training, enabling flexible sampling.

Result: Experiments show a 3x latency reduction and up to 3.5-point FID score improvement on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers solver-agnostic efficiency and performance gains, with released code and model weights for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes text-to-text regression as a scalable alternative to traditional tabular regression for predicting metric outcomes in complex systems like configuration files or logs, achieving superior performance on Google's Borg system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tabular regression struggles with complex systems data where feature engineering is impractical, necessitating a more general and scalable solution.

Method: A 60M parameter encoder-decoder model trained from random initialization is used for text-to-text regression, evaluated on predicting resource efficiency in Google's Borg system.

Result: The model achieves up to 0.99 rank correlation, 100x lower MSE than tabular methods, and adapts to new tasks with just 500 few-shot examples.

Conclusion: Text-to-text regression is a powerful, adaptable approach for predicting real-world outcomes, paving the way for universal simulators.

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration
files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose
text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the
entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily
adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of
complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of
using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent
uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal
simulators of real-world outcomes.

TL;DR: FedIRT combines IRT with federated learning for privacy-preserving, distributed ability and item calibration without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IRT requires centralized data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers privacy and distributed computing benefits.

Method: Proposes Federated Item Response Theory (FedIRT) for distributed IRT estimation, validated via numerical experiments and real-world data.

Result: FedIRT matches standard IRT accuracy while ensuring privacy and reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: FedIRT extends IRT to distributed settings like multi-school assessments, offering privacy and accuracy, supported by an open-source R package.

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate
respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT
estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one
place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an
emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of
privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from
federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework,
Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT
models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner
without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy
similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering
critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We
also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends
IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,
without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we
provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized multimodal knowledge graphs lack collaboration systems with strong reasoning and safety guarantees, necessitating a privacy-preserving solution.

Method: Proposes HidE for recovering multimodal distributions and MMFeD3 for knowledge transfer via logit and feature distillation.

Result: Experiments show MMFeD3-HidE's effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses multimodal challenges in federated settings while preserving privacy.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,
multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized,
lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability
and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over
federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client
heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed
Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence
and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive
evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel gradient-based method optimizes neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) simultaneously for parameters and structure, enabling applications like online reinforcement learning in vision-based tasks, demonstrated with the game DOOM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NFNs offer transparency and performance but lack a systematic design process, often leading to suboptimal architectures due to isolated optimization of parameters and structure.

Method: The proposed approach, gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation, concurrently optimizes NFNs' parameters and structure, addressing their intertwined nature.

Result: The method successfully trains NFNs via online reinforcement learning, achieving proficiency in vision-based tasks like playing DOOM.

Conclusion: Simultaneous optimization of NFNs' parameters and structure unlocks new applications, proving effective in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function
approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but
their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these
advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work
will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and
structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and
subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called
gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs'
parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure
should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings
previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online
reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of
concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online
reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a
vision-based video game called DOOM.

TL;DR: M3PO is a scalable MBRL framework improving sample efficiency and generalization by integrating an implicit world model and hybrid exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in multi-task domains, overcoming limitations of existing model-based and model-free methods.

Method: Combines an implicit world model (predicting task outcomes without reconstruction) with hybrid exploration (model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven bonuses). Uses discrepancies between value estimates to guide exploration and trust-region optimizer for stable updates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, offering an efficient and robust alternative to existing methods.

Conclusion: M3PO effectively eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods, providing a scalable and high-performing solution for MBRL.

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data and enhance model transferability to unexplored chemical regions.

Method: Multi-task learning with shared message passing layers and multiple decoding heads, distributed across GPUs for parallelism.

Result: Efficient scaling on Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers with training on 24 million structures.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances scalability and generalizability for large, diverse datasets in atomistic modeling.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

TL;DR: A theoretical framework explains how discrete symbolic structures emerge from continuous neural network training dynamics using Wasserstein gradient flow and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between continuous neural learning and discrete symbolic reasoning by understanding the emergence of symbolic structures in neural networks.

Method: Lifts neural parameters to a measure space, models training as Wasserstein gradient flow, and analyzes decoupling and contraction under geometric constraints like group invariance.

Result: Training transitions from high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations with lower degrees of freedom, complying with algebraic operations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete reasoning.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training
dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training
as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as
group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent
phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization
trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction
on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints
relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative
semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network
transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional
representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower
degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing
symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that
facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation
for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous
learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the practical benefits of FmAD and ZO as memory-efficient alternatives to BP, especially in low-resource settings, by comparing them with BP variants like checkpointing.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on large language and vision-language models, evaluating memory usage, accuracy, convergence speed, and computation.

Result: BP with checkpointing outperforms FmAD and ZO, achieving higher accuracy (31.1%), faster convergence (34.8%), and fewer computations (3.8x) at similar memory usage.

Conclusion: BP with checkpointing remains the most effective strategy for memory-constrained training, highlighting fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO.

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO)
optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to
backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource
settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps:
a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation
checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents
a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO
methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce
memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and
computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with
larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on
large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing
outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance
reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and
3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight
fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as
the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained
settings. Our code is available at

Method: The study employs Koopman operator theory and delay embedding techniques, supported by numerical experiments to analyze partial observations.

Result: Numerical experiments reveal a power-law behavior in accuracy relative to additive noise amplitude, with insights into the exponent's role in partial observation effects.

Conclusion: The work underscores the importance of distinguishing state and function spaces in stochastic systems and validates the utility of delay embedding for partial observations.

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of
observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems,
the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling
partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman
operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to
connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this
work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using
the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of
distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems.
Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for
partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law
behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also
discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the
effects of partial observation.

Result: A comprehensive survey of CRL, including a new taxonomy and analysis of challenges, is presented.

Conclusion: CRL shows promise for overcoming RL's limitations, but challenges remain. Future research should focus on practical applications and scalability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important machine learning paradigm for
solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed
remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural
networks. However, the success of RL currently relies on extensive training
data and computational resources. In addition, RL's limited ability to
generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world
environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual
Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to
address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to
new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide
a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges,
and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works,
organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario
settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them
into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.
Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to 6G requires semantic-aware communication, focusing on task-relevant information rather than bit-centric transmission.

Method: TOAST combines deep reinforcement learning for task balancing, LoRA for efficient fine-tuning in a Swin Transformer-based architecture, and a diffusion model for noise restoration.

Result: TOAST outperforms baselines in classification accuracy and reconstruction quality, especially in low SNR conditions, while remaining robust across scenarios.

Conclusion: TOAST provides a unified solution for semantic-aware communication in 6G, demonstrating superior adaptability and performance.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric
transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant
information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic
Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of
multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three
complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a
Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic
classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we
integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our
Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead
while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse
interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that
operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises,
providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves
superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant
improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance
across all tested scenarios.

Motivation: VQAs face challenges like barren plateaus and poorly conditioned optimization landscapes, limiting their effectiveness. GuiderNet aims to address these issues by leveraging geometric meta-conditioning.

Method: GuiderNet, a classical neural network, meta-trains to condition PQCs using data-dependent parameter shifts, minimizing the log condition number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. It guides initialization and adaptive modulation during training.

Result: On the Kaggle Diabetes task, GuiderNet reduces training loss by 5x, boosts test accuracy from 75.3% to 98.6%, and improves minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also stabilizes optimization.

Conclusion: Geometric meta-conditioning via GuiderNet mitigates barren plateaus and ill-conditioning, enhancing trainability and generalization in quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum
advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and
poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a
meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition
number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural
network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically
favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to
steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces
cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to
98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also
suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling
smoother and more robust optimization. These results demonstrate that geometric
meta-conditioning can mitigate barren plateaus and ill-conditioning, providing
a scalable approach to enhance trainability and generalization in quantum
machine learning.

### [349] [Physics-informed network paradigm with data generation and background noise removal for diverse distributed acoustic sensing applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21952)
*Yangyang Wan, Haotian Wang, Xuhui Yu, Jiageng Chen, Xinyu Fan, Zuyuan He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is proposed, eliminating the need for real-world event data in training by using physical modeling. It achieves high accuracy in event identification and noise removal, demonstrating strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitation of scarce real-world event data in DAS applications by leveraging physics-informed AI models.

Method: Derives physical functions to train a generative network for DAS event data, then trains a debackground net for noise removal. Validated on public datasets and belt conveyor fault monitoring.

Result: Achieves 91.8% fault diagnosis accuracy without real-world training data, outperforming data-driven models.

Conclusion: The paradigm addresses data scarcity and noise issues in DAS, offering a scalable solution for diverse applications.

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The
proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of
data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore
more potential fields for DAS.

### [350] [Optimal Return-to-Go Guided Decision Transformer for Auto-Bidding in Advertisement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21956)
*Hao Jiang, Yongxiang Tang, Yanxiang Zeng, Pengjia Yuan, Yanhua Cheng, Teng Sha, Xialong Liu, Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R* Decision Transformer (R* DT) to improve auto-bidding in online advertising by addressing limitations of traditional Decision Transformer (DT) through a three-step enhancement process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-bidding tools in online advertising face challenges like short-sightedness and reliance on mixed-quality training data. The paper aims to enhance automation by overcoming these issues.

Method: The proposed R* DT involves three steps: R DT (stores actions and RTG values), R^ DT (forecasts optimal RTG values), and R* DT (augments training data with high-reward trajectories).

Result: Tests on a public bidding dataset show R* DT outperforms traditional DT, especially with mixed-quality trajectories.

Conclusion: R* DT effectively improves auto-bidding by refining RTG values and optimizing policies, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

*Rafael Sojo, Javier Díaz-Rozo, Concha Bielza, Pedro Larrañaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new probabilistic semiparametric model using data binning reduces computational costs in kernel density estimation, achieving comparable accuracy to non-binned models but faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency and curse of dimensionality in kernel density estimation for nonparametric distributions.

Method: Develops two conditional probability distributions (sparse binned kernel density estimation and Fourier kernel density estimation) using sparse tensors and parent node restrictions.

Result: Binned semiparametric Bayesian networks match the performance of non-binned models in structural learning and log-likelihood but are significantly faster.

Conclusion: The binned semiparametric Bayesian networks offer a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

*Mohammad Sabbaqi, Riccardo Taormina, Elvin Isufi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a graph-aware state space model for graph time series, combining graph-temporal patterns with a parametric approach for efficient learning and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for computationally affordable models that capture graph-temporal patterns in applications like urban water networks, economics, and neuroscience.

Method: Uses a graph-induced state space model with stochastic partial differential equations for the state and graph-filtered observations. Combines maximum likelihood and deep learning for inference.

Result: Develops a scalable and expressive model for learning parameters and tracking states, suitable for prediction and imputation tasks.

Conclusion: The model effectively balances theoretical tractability and practical scalability, leveraging deep learning for improved performance.

Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in
applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked
neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a
computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal
patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model
for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation
are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that
need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow
a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs
edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for
increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The
graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable
to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The
observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state
capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters
in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for
downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first
through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability
but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we
use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning
architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an
end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

### [353] [TROFI: Trajectory-Ranked Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22008)
*Alessandro Sestini, Joakim Bergdahl, Konrad Tollmar, Andrew D. Bagdanov, Linus Gisslén*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TROFI is a novel offline reinforcement learning method that learns a reward function from human preferences, eliminating the need for pre-defined rewards or optimal trajectories. It outperforms baselines and matches ground truth reward performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In applied settings like video game development, reward functions are often unavailable, making offline reinforcement learning challenging. TROFI addresses this by learning rewards from human preferences.

Method: TROFI learns a reward function from human preferences, labels the dataset with it, and trains the policy offline. It avoids needing optimal trajectories.

Result: TROFI outperforms baselines on the D4RL benchmark and matches performance using ground truth rewards. It also works well in a 3D game environment.

Conclusion: A well-engineered reward function is crucial for aligning value functions with actual rewards. TROFI proves effective without pre-defined rewards or optimal trajectories.

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

TL;DR: UniCA bridges Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with covariate-aware forecasting by homogenizing and fusing diverse covariates, enhancing their adaptability to real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSFMs struggle with heterogeneous covariates (e.g., categorical variables, multimodal data), limiting their generalization. UniCA aims to address this gap.

Method: UniCA homogenizes covariates into series representations and fuses them via attention, preserving TSFMs' generalization.

Result: UniCA outperforms on unimodal and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating effective covariate adaptation.

Conclusion: UniCA successfully adapts TSFMs for diverse covariates, showing promise for real-world forecasting.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RWFT is a lightweight unlearning method that erases a class from a trained classifier without full retraining, outperforming existing methods in metrics and robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enforce user deletion rights and mitigate biased predictions without costly full retraining.

Method: Output-reweighting technique redistributing probability mass for the forgotten class, robust to membership inference attacks.

Result: Matches full retraining results, gains 2.79% in prior metrics and 111.45% in new TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT effectively unlearns classes, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and resists attacks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPAS is a technique to mitigate activation variance growth in Pre-LN Transformers, improving performance across model sizes and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformers suffer from exponential activation variance growth, limiting deeper layers' learning capacity.

Method: Proposes Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), which scales down activations while preserving gradients.

Result: GPAS achieves consistent performance gains in models from 71M to 1B parameters and works with other architectures.

Conclusion: GPAS is versatile and effective for improving training dynamics in various Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

Method: Combines LSTM for temporal dependencies and XGBoost for nonlinear relationships with auxiliary features like sentiment scores.

Result: The hybrid model consistently outperforms standalone models and traditional methods on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin datasets.

Conclusion: Hybrid architectures like LSTM+XGBoost show promise for financial forecasting across diverse cryptocurrencies and market contexts.

Abstract: The volatility and complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets present unique
challenges for accurate price forecasting. This research proposes a hybrid deep
learning and machine learning model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for cryptocurrency
price prediction. The LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in
historical price data, while XGBoost enhances prediction by modeling nonlinear
relationships with auxiliary features such as sentiment scores and
macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and
localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE) and Min-Max Normalized Root Mean Square Error (MinMax RMSE)
demonstrates that the LSTM+XGBoost hybrid consistently outperforms standalone

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Transformer architectures and GNNs, highlighting their shared principles and hardware advantages.

Method: Analyze Transformers as message-passing GNNs on fully connected token graphs, using self-attention and positional encodings.

Result: Transformers are expressive set processors with hardware-efficient implementations, outperforming traditional GNNs.

Conclusion: Transformers are GNNs benefiting from modern hardware, offering a powerful alternative for graph representation learning.

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two neural approaches for multi-objective routing on multigraphs: one works directly on the multigraph, the other prunes it first. Both show strong performance in TSP and CVRP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked multigraph setting in learning-based routing, which is highly practical.

Method: 1. Autoregressive edge selection on multigraphs. 2. Prune multigraph into a simple graph before routing.

Result: Both models perform well in TSP and CVRP.

Conclusion: Neural approaches effectively handle multi-objective routing on multigraphs.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in
recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However,
the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist
between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical
relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

TL;DR: A deep-learning model simplifies heavy metal pollution assessment in soils and seaports, outperforming traditional methods with lower errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing laborious procedures and data scarcity in conventional Pollution Load Index (PLI) assessments for heavy metal pollution.

Method: Uses transfer learning to develop a quantitative PLI prediction model, evaluated on data from six Australian ports.

Result: Achieves significantly lower MAE (0.5) and MAPE (0.03), outperforming baseline models by up to 2 orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The model provides an innovative, cost-effective solution for water quality prediction, aiding environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional
environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international
standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the
conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of
sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based
model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the
issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally
plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations.
By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment
method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features
across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using
data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port
Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results
demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared
to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than
other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and
cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life
conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

TL;DR: The paper explores machine learning and deep learning models, including XGBoost and SMOTE, to predict earthquake-induced structural damage grades, addressing class imbalance and evaluating performance through feature manipulation and confusion matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate post-earthquake damage assessment is critical for effective disaster response and resource allocation, but class imbalance in data can skew model performance.

Method: Uses multi-class classification models (XGBoost, deep learning, ensembling) and SMOTE to handle class imbalance, with feature manipulation and confusion matrices for evaluation.

Result: Identifies key factors for seismic vulnerability and evaluates model performance, highlighting the effectiveness of SMOTE and feature manipulation.

Conclusion: The study enhances earthquake damage prediction by addressing class imbalance and optimizing model performance, aiding better disaster response.

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and
infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response
efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to
prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating
damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response
and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties,
underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes.
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification,
especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling
methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One
consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that
undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This
research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple
multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and
ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates
performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments
and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to
seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like
the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of
earthquake damage prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, extending Thompson sampling to general function spaces for active learning-based controller design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson sampling (TS) is limited to finite parametric representations, restricting its use in general control system design spaces. This work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: The proposed method treats control laws as elements in a function space, using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces for parameterization. A TS framework explores optimal control laws with convergence guarantees.

Result: The method learns control-law-to-performance relationships exponentially fast, with derived upper bounds on control regret. Numerical experiments confirm its effectiveness for nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: The approach successfully generalizes TS to function spaces, enabling flexible control law design without structural restrictions, supported by theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric
uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller
design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits
its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered
in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a
parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach.
Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a
function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing
restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS
framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws,
and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process.
Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship
between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential
rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical
experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Result: Achieves 8.8x faster training, 10x less memory, 42% less storage, with minimal performance impact.

Conclusion: Enables efficient, scalable learning for resource-constrained applications like federated learning and tinyML.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is
hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful
patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage,
which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance
with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of analysis on how RDL model performance relates to RDB characteristics, given RDL's novelty and potential.

Method: Developed REDELEX, a framework to evaluate RDL models of varying complexity on over 70 diverse RDBs, comparing them with classic methods.

Result: Confirmed RDL's generally superior performance and identified key performance factors like model complexity, database size, and structural properties.

Conclusion: REDELEX provides valuable insights into RDL performance, aiding future research and applications in relational data tasks.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
storing structured information. Consequently, predictive tasks leveraging this
data format hold significant application promise. Recently, Relational Deep
Learning (RDL) has emerged as a novel paradigm wherein RDBs are conceptualized
as graph structures, enabling the application of various graph neural
architectures to effectively address these tasks. However, given its novelty,
there is a lack of analysis into the relationships between the performance of
various RDL models and the characteristics of the underlying RDBs.
  In this study, we present REDELEX$-$a comprehensive exploration framework for
evaluating RDL models of varying complexity on the most diverse collection of
over 70 RDBs, which we make available to the community. Benchmarked alongside
key representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior
performance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping
performance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural
properties.

*Chen Wang, Lai Wei, Yanzhi Zhang, Chenyang Shao, Zedong Dan, Weiran Huang, Yue Wang, Yuzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EFRame enhances GRPO by improving exploration, filtering low-quality samples, and leveraging replay, leading to better performance in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's limitations in exploration, sample efficiency, and instability hinder its performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: EFRame introduces a framework with additional rollouts, online filtering, and experience replay to augment GRPO.

Result: EFRame improves training robustness, efficiency, and unlocks deeper reasoning capabilities compared to vanilla GRPO.

Conclusion: EFRame provides a structured learning cycle and deeper sample analysis, advancing RL for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's
computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and
instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To
address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay
framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our
code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

*Shunta Nonaga, Koji Tabata, Yuta Mizuno, Tamiki Komatsuzaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel stochastic bandit optimization framework is introduced to balance expected reward and risk using the mean-variance criterion, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenge of maximizing expected reward and minimizing risk in uncertain decision-making environments, a common problem across disciplines.

Method: Proposes a unified meta-algorithmic framework for stochastic bandit optimization, adaptable to fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, with tailored confidence intervals.

Result: Theoretical guarantees confirm solution correctness; empirical evaluations show superior accuracy and sample efficiency over existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses risk-aware decision-making, demonstrating broad applicability in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected
reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many
subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit
optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making:
maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified
via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations
that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and
accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best
trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified
meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and
fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals
tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in
both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our
approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample
efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making
tasks in uncertain environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Projected Compression reduces model size using projection modules without increasing computational overhead, outperforming pruning and retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models' growing size increases inference time and computational demands, prompting interest in size reduction methods.

Method: Train additional projection weights, merge them into a lower-dimensional matrix, and reduce model size while matching the base model's FLOPs.

Result: Outperforms hard pruning and retraining, with performance scaling well with token count.

Conclusion: Projected Compression is an efficient method for model size reduction without added computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

### [368] [Score-Based Model for Low-Rank Tensor Recovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22295)
*Zhengyun Cheng, Changhao Wang, Guanwen Zhang, Yi Xu, Wei Zhou, Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A score-based model replaces predefined structural assumptions in tensor decompositions, using neural networks to learn compatibility between tensors and shared factors, improving performance in tensor completion and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tensor decomposition methods rely on fixed structural assumptions (e.g., CP or Tucker), which may not align with practical scenarios, leading to accuracy loss.

Method: A neural network learns the energy function via score matching, capturing gradients of joint log-probability. Block coordinate descent (BCD) with smooth regularization enables tensor completion and denoising.

Result: The method outperforms traditional approaches, showing improvements across sparse, continuous-time tensors, and visual data.

Conclusion: The proposed score-based model eliminates rigid assumptions, offering flexibility and enhanced performance in multiway data analysis.

Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for
multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural
assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic
perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model
the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such
prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly
regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization
procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations
made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,
we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined
structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of
compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural
network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score
matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries
and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions
beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate
descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the
model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types,
including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

*Tao Liu, Longlong Lin, Yunfeng Yu, Xi Ou, Youan Zhang, Zhiqiu Ye, Tao Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoATA is a dual-channel GNN framework for co-augmenting topology and attributes, outperforming baselines by addressing noise and incompleteness in graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs often have noise and incompleteness, degrading GNN performance. Existing methods focus on single-dimensional augmentation, ignoring deeper interplays between topology and attributes.

Method: CoATA propagates structural signals to enrich node attributes, projects enhanced attributes into a bipartite graph, and uses contrastive learning with prototype alignment for mutual corrections.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven datasets show CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CoATA effectively captures the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes, enhancing GNN performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

*Takumi Okuo, Shinnosuke Matsuo, Shota Harada, Kiyohito Tanaka, Ryoma Bise*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A weakly-supervised domain adaptation method is proposed to address domain shift in medical applications by leveraging target domain class proportions for pseudo-labeling, improving performance without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in medical data degrades model performance when applied across institutions. Existing methods struggle with differing class proportions between domains.

Method: Proportion-constrained pseudo-labeling uses target domain class proportions to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, avoiding additional annotations.

Result: Outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation on endoscopic datasets, even with only 5% labeled target data, and shows robustness to noisy proportion labels.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses domain shift in medical applications by utilizing class proportions, demonstrating practical utility and robustness.

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in
medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to
variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can
degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to
the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to
address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source
and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target
domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge
or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled
target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained
pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional
annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the
target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy
proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating
its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

*Erkan Turan, Aristotelis Siozopoulos, Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Koopman-CFM integrates Koopman operator theory to linearize generative dynamics, enabling faster, interpretable sampling via matrix exponentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFM relies on computationally expensive non-linear ODEs, lacks interpretability, and recent alternatives don't clarify generative structure.

Method: Proposes a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture, learning a linear embedding for closed-form, one-step sampling.

Result: Achieves significant speedups on 2D datasets, MNIST, F-MNIST, and TFD, with structured Koopman generators for analysis.

Conclusion: Koopman-CFM combines efficiency and interpretability, advancing fast, structured generative modeling.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

### [372] [Less Greedy Equivalence Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22331)
*Adiba Ejaz, Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LGES improves GES by reducing computational cost and improving accuracy, offering speed-ups and better structural error rates while maintaining theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational cost and finite-sample accuracy challenges of GES in causal discovery.

Method: LGES modifies GES's greedy step by avoiding edge insertions where conditional independence is implied, and incorporates prior assumptions and interventional data.

Result: LGES achieves up to a 10-fold speed-up, reduces structural error, and outperforms GES and other baselines in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: LGES is a more efficient and accurate variant of GES, with theoretical guarantees and practical improvements for causal discovery.

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

TL;DR: A framework combining deep learning and epidemic models for forecasting and mechanistic modeling, using diverse datasets with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees, is proposed and validated with a synthetic financial dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diverse datasets enhance epidemiology and public health analyses, but privacy concerns necessitate robust protections like DP. This paper addresses the need for integrating DP-protected data into epidemic modeling.

Method: Develops a framework integrating deep learning and epidemic models to forecast and learn mechanistic spread models, incorporating multiple datasets, some with DP guarantees.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's effectiveness using a synthetic financial dataset with DP, showing significant value in forecasting and epidemic modeling despite privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages DP-protected datasets for epidemic analyses, proving their utility even under privacy constraints.

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in
forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

*Tao Li, Haozhe Lei, Mingsheng Yin, Yaqi Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PiPRL integrates symbolic physics priors into RL via a DSL, improving efficiency and generalization in indoor navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for incorporating physics priors in RL require manual effort and expertise, limiting accessibility. PiPRL aims to automate this process.

Method: PiPRL uses a hierarchical neuro-symbolic framework: a symbolic program (DSL) guides RL, aided by neural perception and control modules.

Result: PiPRL outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26%.

Conclusion: Symbolic integration of physics priors via PiPRL enhances RL efficiency and generalization, making it more accessible.

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks,
inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency
during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current
practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases
inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them
prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to
distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics
priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable
and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into
an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional
physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a
physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to
indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic
integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful
features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic
programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a
low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL
consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces
training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sheaf-DMFL is a decentralized multimodal learning framework using sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among edge devices with diverse modalities, outperforming conventional FL in heterogeneous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FL struggles with multimodal data and varying client capabilities, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Sheaf-DMFL employs local feature encoders for modalities, concatenates outputs, and uses sheaf theory for task-specific layer correlations. Sheaf-DMFL-Att adds an attention mechanism for modality correlations.

Result: Superior performance in real-world scenarios like link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming.

Conclusion: Sheaf-DMFL and Sheaf-DMFL-Att effectively address multimodal challenges in heterogeneous systems, with proven theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for inference-time scaling in LLMs, proposing the \textsc{OptScale} algorithm to dynamically optimize sample numbers, reducing overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heuristic approaches for parallel sampling in LLMs lack a principled foundation, prompting the need for a theoretical and practical solution.

Method: The authors formalize optimality under i.i.d. assumptions, derive a theoretical lower bound for sample numbers, and develop \textsc{OptScale}, which uses a predictor to estimate minimal samples for performance thresholds.

Result: Experiments on math benchmarks show \textsc{OptScale} reduces sampling overhead while matching or outperforming state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical and practical solution for efficient LLM scaling, addressing a critical gap in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

TL;DR: Distributed Neural Architectures (DNAs) generalize sparse methods like Mixture-of-Experts, learning computation and communication patterns end-to-end. They match dense baselines in performance and show emergent specialization and interpretable compute allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore flexible, distributed neural architectures that generalize sparse methods and learn efficient computation/communication patterns from data.

Method: Initialize DNAs with proto-architectures (e.g., transformers, MLPs, routers) allowing tokens to traverse modules in any order. Train end-to-end with optional efficiency constraints.

Result: DNAs perform competitively with dense baselines, exhibit power-law distributed token paths, and show emergent module specialization.

Conclusion: DNAs offer a flexible, efficient, and interpretable approach to neural architecture design, with learned patterns aligning with practical constraints.

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Conclusion: The framework enhances robustness and generalizability, enabling reliable AI deployment in diverse healthcare settings.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method for online RL, integrating exploration and exploitation via a single objective, with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in online RL with complex function approximations, leveraging optimistic regularization.

Method: Proposes VAC, a primal-dual optimization-based approach, combining data consistency and value function maximization.

Result: VAC achieves near-optimal regret guarantees under linear MDPs and extends to general function approximations.

Conclusion: VAC offers a practical and theoretically sound solution for exploration-exploitation trade-offs in RL.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such
as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern
practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance,
balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation
remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of
efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance
guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic
regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of
optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh
perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method,
which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and
exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both
consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value
functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret
guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon
and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function
approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

### [380] [ARMOR: Robust Reinforcement Learning-based Control for UAVs under Physical Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22423)
*Pritam Dash, Ethan Chan, Nathan P. Lawrence, Karthik Pattabiraman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMOR is a model-free RL controller for UAVs that learns robust latent state representations to counter adversarial sensor attacks, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs rely on sensors vulnerable to attacks like GPS spoofing, which can corrupt state estimates. Existing safe RL methods fail against such attacks, necessitating a resilient solution.

Method: ARMOR uses a two-stage training framework: a teacher encoder trained with attack info generates latent states for RL policy training, and a student encoder approximates these states using historical sensor data for real-world deployment.

Result: ARMOR ensures UAV safety, generalizes to unseen attacks, and reduces training costs by avoiding iterative adversarial training.

Conclusion: ARMOR provides an effective, attack-resilient RL controller for UAVs, enhancing robustness and safety under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception,
navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical
attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to
unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control
capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We
present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),
an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation
under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor
observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical
state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher
encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware
latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is
trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states
using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without
privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms
conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves
generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the
need for iterative adversarial training.

*Randeep Bhatia, Nikos Papadis, Murali Kodialam, TV Lakshman, Sayak Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLoVE is a novel algorithm for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) that identifies client clusters using loss vector embeddings, enabling efficient and accurate cluster-specific model optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in CFL is identifying client clusters due to unknown assignments. CLoVE addresses this by leveraging loss patterns to distinguish clusters.

Method: CLoVE uses client embeddings from model losses, iteratively separates clusters, and optimizes cluster-specific models via federated aggregation.

Result: CLoVE achieves accurate cluster recovery in few training rounds and state-of-the-art model accuracy in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: CLoVE is robust, simple, and outperforms existing CFL and PFL algorithms, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.

*Łukasz Struski, Tomasz Danel, Marek Śmieja, Jacek Tabor, Bartosz Zieliński*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG), a gradient-based training method for decision graphs, addressing limitations of decision trees in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision trees are interpretable and fast but lack node reuse, unlike decision graphs, which lacked efficient gradient-based training methods.

Method: The authors propose a paradigm using Markov processes to train SONG, a type of decision graph.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show SONG performs comparably or better than existing decision models.

Conclusion: SONG bridges the gap in efficient training of decision graphs, offering improved performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research on deep interpretable neural
networks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools.
There are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic
regression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are
based on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a
hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision
trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the
decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep
learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In
this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov
processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision
graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an
extensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on
Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our
method performs on par or better than existing decision models.

TL;DR: A flexible framework for OOD detection using knowledge distillation and Confidence Amendment (CA) to train a binary classifier for distinguishing ID and OOD samples, validated by theoretical bounds and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing network robustness and reliability by detecting OOD samples, even without access to training ID data.

Method: Introduces Confidence Amendment (CA) to transform OOD samples into ID-like ones while adjusting prediction confidence, enabling synthesis of ID/OOD samples for classifier training.

Result: Theoretical bounds on generalization error and extensive experiments confirm the method's efficacy in OOD detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves OOD sensitivity and detection performance across diverse datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for identifying test samples
that deviate from in-distribution (ID) data, ensuring network robustness and
reliability. This paper presents a flexible framework for OOD knowledge
distillation that extracts OOD-sensitive information from a network to develop
a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between ID and OOD samples in
both scenarios, with and without access to training ID data. To accomplish
this, we introduce Confidence Amendment (CA), an innovative methodology that
transforms an OOD sample into an ID one while progressively amending prediction
confidence derived from the network to enhance OOD sensitivity. This approach
enables the simultaneous synthesis of both ID and OOD samples, each accompanied
by an adjusted prediction confidence, thereby facilitating the training of a
binary classifier sensitive to OOD. Theoretical analysis provides bounds on the
generalization error of the binary classifier, demonstrating the pivotal role
of confidence amendment in enhancing OOD sensitivity. Extensive experiments
spanning various datasets and network architectures confirm the efficacy of the
proposed method in detecting OOD samples.

*Riccardo Zaccone, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Carlo Masone, Marco Ciccone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) to address bias in momentum updates in Federated Learning, improving performance under data heterogeneity and partial client participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing momentum-based approaches in Federated Learning (FL) are biased towards recently sampled clients, limiting their effectiveness compared to FedAvg, especially in heterogeneous and large-scale settings.

Method: The authors propose GHBM, a novel momentum method, and theoretically prove its convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity and cyclic partial participation. Adaptive and communication-efficient variants are also introduced.

Result: Experiments on vision and language tasks show GHBM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in large-scale, heterogeneous, and low-participation scenarios.

Conclusion: GHBM advances momentum's role in FL, offering robust and efficient solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for
learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios.However,
system and statistical challenges hinder its real-world applicability,
requiring efficient learning from edge devices and robustness to data
heterogeneity. Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches often
degrade severely due to the joint effect of heterogeneity and partial client
participation. In particular, while momentum appears as a promising approach
for overcoming statistical heterogeneity, in current approaches its update is
biased towards the most recently sampled clients. As we show in this work, this
is the reason why it fails to outperform FedAvg, preventing its effective use
in real-world large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel
Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) and theoretically prove it enables
convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity in cyclic partial participation,
thereby advancing the understanding of momentum's effectiveness in FL. We then
introduce adaptive and communication-efficient variants of GHBM that match the
communication complexity of FedAvg in settings where clients can be stateful.
Extensive experiments on vision and language tasks confirm our theoretical
findings, demonstrating that GHBM substantially improves state-of-the-art
performance under random uniform client sampling, particularly in large-scale
settings with high data heterogeneity and low client participation. Code is

*Anna Mészáros, Julian F. Schumann, Javier Alonso-Mora, Arkady Zgonnikov, Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROME is a robust, non-parametric method for multi-modal density estimation, outperforming traditional methods like KDE by clustering samples into uni-modal segments and combining KDE estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing density estimation methods lack robustness and are not well-evaluated for multi-modal problems.

Method: ROME clusters multi-modal samples into uni-modal segments, applies KDE to each, and combines them into a multi-modal estimate.

Result: ROME outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing robustness and avoiding over-fitting or over-smoothing.

Conclusion: ROME effectively addresses challenges in multi-modal density estimation, offering improved performance and robustness.

Abstract: The estimation of probability density functions is a fundamental problem in
science and engineering. However, common methods such as kernel density
estimation (KDE) have been demonstrated to lack robustness, while more complex
methods have not been evaluated in multi-modal estimation problems. In this
paper, we present ROME (RObust Multi-modal Estimator), a non-parametric
approach for density estimation which addresses the challenge of estimating
multi-modal, non-normal, and highly correlated distributions. ROME utilizes
clustering to segment a multi-modal set of samples into multiple uni-modal ones
and then combines simple KDE estimates obtained for individual clusters in a
single multi-modal estimate. We compared our approach to state-of-the-art
methods for density estimation as well as ablations of ROME, showing that it
not only outperforms established methods but is also more robust to a variety
of distributions. Our results demonstrate that ROME can overcome the issues of
over-fitting and over-smoothing exhibited by other estimators.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, distributional reduction, unifying dimensionality reduction and clustering via optimal transport and Gromov-Wasserstein, validated on image and genomic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional unsupervised learning methods (dimensionality reduction and clustering) by integrating them under a unified framework.

Method: Proposes distributional reduction, leveraging optimal transport and Gromov-Wasserstein, to jointly optimize dimensionality reduction and clustering.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in identifying low-dimensional prototypes across image and genomic datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies and extends traditional unsupervised learning methods, offering a versatile approach for data analysis.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning aims to capture the underlying structure of potentially
large and high-dimensional datasets. Traditionally, this involves using
dimensionality reduction (DR) methods to project data onto lower-dimensional
spaces or organizing points into meaningful clusters (clustering). In this
work, we revisit these approaches under the lens of optimal transport and
exhibit relationships with the Gromov-Wasserstein problem. This unveils a new
general framework, called distributional reduction, that recovers DR and
clustering as special cases and allows addressing them jointly within a single
optimization problem. We empirically demonstrate its relevance to the
identification of low-dimensional prototypes representing data at different
scales, across multiple image and genomic datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction in heterophilic datasets, improving performance with a physics-inspired readout function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of link prediction in heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels, a problem underexplored compared to node classification.

Method: Propose GRAFF-LP, which learns to separate edge gradients and incorporates a physics-inspired readout function to enhance link prediction.

Result: GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates edges, and the new readout function improves performance for both GRAFF-LP and baseline models.

Conclusion: Heterophily measures for link prediction should differ from node classification, and simple GNNs perform comparably on heterophilic and homophilic links.

Abstract: The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not
naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have
different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of
node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link
prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation
systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have
improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases
in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for
link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from
non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based
on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics.
Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but
also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every
link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide
evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in
predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to
believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for
link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification. The code and
appendix are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a systematic comparison of weight matrices and component functions in attention learning motivated the development of Spectraformer.

Method: The framework combines kernel approximation and learning techniques within the random feature paradigm, offering various variants for attention learning.

Result: Spectraformer matches top sparse and low-rank methods on the Long Range Arena benchmark, setting a new standard for random feature-based Transformers.

Conclusion: Spectraformer provides a versatile and efficient approach for attention learning, with variants balancing accuracy, training time, and memory usage.

Abstract: Linearization of attention using various kernel approximation and kernel
learning techniques has shown promise. Past methods used a subset of
combinations of component functions and weight matrices within the random
feature paradigm. We identify the need for a systematic comparison of different
combinations of weight matrices and component functions for attention learning
in Transformer. Hence, we introduce Spectraformer, a unified framework for
approximating and learning the kernel function in the attention mechanism of
the Transformer. Our empirical results demonstrate, for the first time, that a
random feature-based approach can achieve performance comparable to
top-performing sparse and low-rank methods on the challenging Long Range Arena
benchmark. Thus, we establish a new state-of-the-art for random feature-based
efficient Transformers. The framework also produces many variants that offer
different advantages in accuracy, training time, and memory consumption. Our

TL;DR: A new pipeline generates synthetic EHR data to address fairness in health AI tools, complementing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in AI for healthcare, especially EHR-based models, lacks task- and model-agnostic solutions.

Method: Proposed pipeline generates synthetic EHR data faithful to real data while reducing fairness concerns.

Result: Effective across various tasks and datasets, adding a versatile tool to fairness mitigation methods.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a widely applicable solution for fairness in health AI, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Among various aspects of ensuring the responsible design of AI tools for
healthcare applications, addressing fairness concerns has been a key focus
area. Specifically, given the wide spread of electronic health record (EHR)
data and their huge potential to inform a wide range of clinical decision
support tasks, improving fairness in this category of health AI tools is of key
importance. While such a broad problem (mitigating fairness in EHR-based AI
models) has been tackled using various methods, task- and model-agnostic
methods are noticeably rare. In this study, we aimed to target this gap by
presenting a new pipeline that generates synthetic EHR data, which is not only
consistent with (faithful to) the real EHR data but also can reduce the
fairness concerns (defined by the end-user) in the downstream tasks, when
combined with the real data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
pipeline across various downstream tasks and two different EHR datasets. Our
proposed pipeline can add a widely applicable and complementary tool to the
existing toolbox of methods to address fairness in health AI applications, such
as those modifying the design of a downstream model. The codebase for our
project is available at https://github.com/healthylaife/FairSynth

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to balance targeting high-need individuals with learning treatment effects in social programs, offering a Pareto frontier for policymakers. It includes sample complexity guarantees and a practical implementation strategy, validated with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflict between targeting high-need recipients and evaluating causal effects in social programs, which often requires randomization.

Method: A framework for designing randomized allocation rules that balance targeting and learning, with computational efficiency and sample complexity guarantees. Validated using real data from Allegheny County.

Result: Optimized policies mitigate the tradeoff, achieving 90% of optimal targeting utility while requiring less than 2x the samples of a randomized trial for effect estimation.

Conclusion: Algorithmic systems in public services should integrate program evaluation alongside targeting to maximize impact.

Abstract: Many social programs attempt to allocate scarce resources to people with the
greatest need. Indeed, public services increasingly use algorithmic risk
assessments motivated by this goal. However, targeting the highest-need
recipients often conflicts with attempting to evaluate the causal effect of the
program as a whole, as the best evaluations would be obtained by randomizing
the allocation. We propose a framework to design randomized allocation rules
which optimally balance targeting high-need individuals with learning treatment
effects, presenting policymakers with a Pareto frontier between the two goals.
We give sample complexity guarantees for the policy learning problem and
provide a computationally efficient strategy to implement it. We then
collaborate with the human services department of Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania to evaluate our methods on data from real service delivery
settings. Optimized policies can substantially mitigate the tradeoff between
learning and targeting. For example, it is often possible to obtain 90% of the
optimal utility in targeting high-need individuals while ensuring that the
average treatment effect can be estimated with less than 2 times the samples
that a randomized controlled trial would require. Mechanisms for targeting
public services often focus on measuring need as accurately as possible.
However, our results suggest that algorithmic systems in public services can be
most impactful if they incorporate program evaluation as an explicit goal
alongside targeting.

*Chen Peng, Di Zhang, Urbashi Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the causal bandit problem, proposing a method to learn causal graphs and optimize interventions for long-term reward, with improved sample complexity and performance over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maximizing long-term reward in causal bandits where both the causal topology and intervention distributions are unknown, and to handle non-stationary settings.

Method: A causal graph learning method is introduced, focusing on sub-graphs to reduce sample complexity. An uncertainty bound for intervention selection is derived, and a change detection mechanism for non-stationary settings is designed.

Result: Numerical results show the method reduces sample complexity, achieves 85% reward gain, and performs well in both stationary and non-stationary scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in learning causal structures and optimizing rewards, though sample complexity analysis remains future work.

Abstract: In this paper, the causal bandit problem is investigated, with the objective
of maximizing the long-term reward by selecting an optimal sequence of
interventions on nodes in an unknown causal graph. It is assumed that both the
causal topology and the distribution of interventions are unknown. First, based
on the difference between the two types of graph identification errors (false
positives and negatives), a causal graph learning method is proposed. Numerical
results suggest that this method has a much lower sample complexity relative to
the prior art by learning sub-graphs. However, we note that a sample complexity
analysis for the new algorithm has not been undertaken, as of yet. Under the
assumption of minimum-mean squared error weight estimation, a new uncertainty
bound tailored to the causal bandit problem is derived. This uncertainty bound
drives an upper confidence bound-based intervention selection to optimize the
reward. Further, we consider a particular instance of non-stationary bandits
wherein both the causal topology and interventional distributions can change.
Our solution is the design of a sub-graph change detection mechanism that
requires a modest number of samples. Numerical results compare the new
methodology to existing schemes and show a substantial performance improvement
in stationary and non-stationary settings. Averaged over 100 randomly generated
causal bandits, the proposed scheme takes significantly fewer samples to learn
the causal structure and achieves a reward gain of 85% compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates distilling large Transformer models into linear RNNs (like Mamba) for efficient deployment, achieving competitive performance with fewer attention layers and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying large Transformer models efficiently by leveraging linear RNN architectures, which offer better deployment characteristics.

Method: Distilling pretrained Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing attention layer weights and introducing a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm.

Result: The hybrid model matches original Transformer performance in benchmarks, outperforms open-source Mamba models, and achieves high win rates against GPT-4.

Conclusion: Linear RNNs can be competitive with Transformers when distilled, offering efficient deployment and inference with limited resources.

Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer
models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment
characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we
consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We
demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs
by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic
GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the
attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer
in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from
scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general
benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding
algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models.
Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of
the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more
efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct,
achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and
7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN
model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation,
showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the
distillation length. Code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with hidden variables and a polynomial delay algorithm to list conditional independence (CI) constraints efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing causal models against observational data requires checking CI relations, which can be impractical due to their exponential number. Existing methods for hidden variables and non-parametric distributions are inefficient.

Method: Proposes C-LMP for causal graphs with hidden variables and develops a polynomial delay algorithm to list CI constraints efficiently.

Result: The algorithm enables poly-delay testing of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables, demonstrated on real-world and synthetic data.

Conclusion: The C-LMP and accompanying algorithm provide a practical solution for testing causal models with hidden variables efficiently.

Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key
prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test
whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold
in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to
the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and
unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give
rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly
smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an
algorithm to list the relevant CIs. However, existing algorithms for realistic
settings with hidden variables and non-parametric distributions can take
exponential time to produce even a single CI constraint. In this paper, we
introduce the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with
hidden variables. Since C-LMP can still invoke an exponential number of CIs, we
develop a polynomial delay algorithm to list these CIs in poly-time intervals.
To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that enables poly-delay testing
of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables against arbitrary data
distributions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the
practicality of our algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zebra, a generative auto-regressive transformer, solves parametric PDEs without gradient adaptation at inference, leveraging in-context learning for adaptability and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adapting data-driven methods to variations in parametric PDEs, avoiding increased inference complexity from gradient-based optimization.

Method: Zebra uses in-context learning during pre-training and inference, conditioning on input sequences with example trajectories to dynamically adapt.

Result: Zebra outperforms existing approaches in adaptability, robustness, and performance across various PDE scenarios.

Conclusion: Zebra offers a novel, efficient solution for parametric PDEs with generative capabilities and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is
challenging for data-driven methods, as these models must adapt to variations
in parameters such as coefficients, forcing terms, and initial conditions.
State-of-the-art neural surrogates perform adaptation through gradient-based
optimization and meta-learning to implicitly encode the variety of dynamics
from observations. This often comes with increased inference complexity.
Inspired by the in-context learning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), we introduce Zebra, a novel generative auto-regressive transformer
designed to solve parametric PDEs without requiring gradient adaptation at
inference. By leveraging in-context information during both pre-training and
inference, Zebra dynamically adapts to new tasks by conditioning on input
sequences that incorporate context example trajectories. As a generative model,
Zebra can be used to generate new trajectories and allows quantifying the
uncertainty of the predictions. We evaluate Zebra across a variety of

*Saqib Javed, Hieu Le, Mathieu Salzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QT-DoG uses weight quantization to find flatter minima in the loss landscape, improving domain generalization by acting as an implicit regularizer. It also enables efficient ensemble models without extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent overfitting to source domains in Domain Generalization (DG) by finding flatter minima in the loss landscape.

Method: Proposes Quantization-aware Training for Domain Generalization (QT-DoG), using quantization to induce noise in weights and guide optimization toward flatter minima.

Result: Quantization leads to flatter minima, better generalization, and efficient ensemble models outperforming state-of-the-art DG methods.

Conclusion: QT-DoG effectively enhances domain generalization through quantization, offering both performance and efficiency benefits.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Generalization (DG) is preventing overfitting to
source domains, which can be mitigated by finding flatter minima in the loss
landscape. In this work, we propose Quantization-aware Training for Domain
Generalization (QT-DoG) and demonstrate that weight quantization effectively
leads to flatter minima in the loss landscape, thereby enhancing domain
generalization. Unlike traditional quantization methods focused on model
compression, QT-DoG exploits quantization as an implicit regularizer by
inducing noise in model weights, guiding the optimization process toward
flatter minima that are less sensitive to perturbations and overfitting. We
provide both an analytical perspective and empirical evidence demonstrating
that quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better
generalization across domains. Moreover, with the benefit of reducing the model
size through quantization, we demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple
quantized models further yields superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art DG
approaches with no computational or memory overheads. Code is released at:

*Zhen Qin, Zhaomin Wu, Bingsheng He, Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedHDS is a federated data-efficient instruction tuning method for LLMs, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency without sharing raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated tuning methods consume all local data, leading to computational overhead and overfitting, while centralized solutions violate privacy.

Method: FedHDS selects a representative subset of edge-side data for tuning, addressing redundancy at intra- and inter-client levels.

Result: FedHDS improves Rouge-L by 10.72% on unseen tasks, using <1.5% of data and boosting efficiency by up to tens of times.

Conclusion: FedHDS offers a privacy-preserving, efficient solution for federated instruction tuning, outperforming full-data methods.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a crucial step in improving the responsiveness of
pretrained large language models (LLMs) to human instructions. Federated
learning (FL) helps to exploit the use of vast private instruction data from
clients, becoming popular for LLM tuning by improving data diversity. Existing
federated tuning simply consumes all local data, causing excessive
computational overhead and overfitting to local data, while centralized
data-efficient solutions are not suitable for FL due to privacy concerns. This
work presents FedHDS, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach,
which tunes LLMs with a representative subset of edge-side data. It reduces the
data redundancy at both intra- and inter-client levels without sharing raw
data. Experiments with various LLMs, datasets and partitions show that FedHDS
improves Rouge-L on unseen tasks by an average of 10.72% over the SOTA
full-data federated instruction tuning methods, while using less than 1.5% of
the data samples, improving training efficiency by up to tens of times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify hyperpartisan news, which polarizes political views and divides the public, using automated methods.

Hyperpartisan news is news that takes an extremely polarized political
standpoint with an intention of creating political divide among the public. We
attempted several approaches, including n-grams, sentiment analysis, as well as

*Zhi Sheng, Daisy Yuan, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NPDiff, a novel framework, improves mobile traffic prediction by decomposing noise into prior and residual components, enhancing model performance by over 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile traffic prediction is challenging due to its non-stationary nature. Existing methods overlook noise's role, leading to sub-optimal results.

Method: NPDiff decomposes noise into prior (from data dynamics) and residual components, integrating seamlessly with diffusion models.

Result: NPDiff achieves over 30% performance improvement, capturing both regular and abrupt traffic variations effectively.

Conclusion: NPDiff offers a new perspective on leveraging noise in diffusion models, significantly enhancing mobile traffic prediction.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, i.e., network traffic from cellular
base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting
urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven
by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and
abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal
dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most
existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often
neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal
performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the
role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise
fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and
consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into
prior and residual components, with the prior} derived from data dynamics,
enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations.
NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models,
delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an
improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion
models in this domain. We provide code and data at

Result: Comprehensive insights into TPP advancements, showcasing the potential of neural and LLM-based methods for complex temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: TPPs continue to evolve with deep learning and LLMs, offering new opportunities and challenges for future research in event sequence modeling.

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are stochastic process models used to
characterize event sequences occurring in continuous time. Traditional
statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed
and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in
deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater
flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The
emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement,
offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by
leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a
comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives:
Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the
fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model
design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also
revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decoupled SGDA reduces communication overhead in multiplayer games by allowing players to update strategies independently with periodic synchronization, achieving near-optimal communication complexity for SCSC games and outperforming federated methods in noisy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of high communication costs and outdated/noisy strategies in multiplayer games, where frequent strategy exchanges are impractical.

Method: Introduces Decoupled SGDA, where players update strategies independently using outdated opponent data, with periodic synchronization. Analyzed for SCSC and weakly coupled games, and quadratic minimax problems.

Result: Achieves near-optimal communication complexity for SCSC games, reduces costs in weakly coupled games, and outperforms federated methods in imbalanced noise settings.

Conclusion: Decoupled SGDA is effective for reducing communication overhead while maintaining performance, especially in noisy or weakly coupled multiplayer games.

Abstract: We focus on reducing communication overhead in multiplayer games, where
frequently exchanging strategies between players is not feasible and players
have noisy or outdated strategies of the other players. We introduce Decoupled
SGDA, a novel adaptation of Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA). In this
approach, players independently update their strategies based on outdated
opponent strategies, with periodic synchronization to align strategies. For
Strongly-Convex-Strongly-Concave (SCSC) games, we demonstrate that Decoupled
SGDA achieves near-optimal communication complexity comparable to the
best-known GDA rates. For weakly coupled games where the interaction between
players is lower relative to the non-interactive part of the game, Decoupled
SGDA significantly reduces communication costs compared to standard SGDA. Our
findings extend to multi-player games. To provide insights into the effect of
communication frequency and convergence, we extensively study the convergence
of Decoupled SGDA for quadratic minimax problems. Lastly, in settings where the
noise over the players is imbalanced, Decoupled SGDA significantly outperforms
federated minimax methods.

*Pui Ieng Lei, Ximing Chen, Yijun Sheng, Yanyan Liu, Jingzhi Guo, Zhiguo Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph gradual domain adaptation (GGDA) framework is introduced to handle large distribution shifts in graphs by constructing a compact domain sequence with minimal information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with large distribution shifts in graphs due to the challenge of simulating an evolving path from source to target.

Method: GGDA generates knowledge-preserving intermediate graphs using the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric and constructs domains via vertex-based progression with 'close' vertex selections and adaptive advancement.

Result: The framework provides theoretical bounds for inter-domain distance and demonstrates superior performance in experiments.

Conclusion: GGDA effectively addresses large distribution shifts in graphs, offering a flexible and efficient solution.

Abstract: Existing literature lacks a graph domain adaptation technique for handling
large distribution shifts, primarily due to the difficulty in simulating an
evolving path from source to target graph. To make a breakthrough, we present a
graph gradual domain adaptation (GGDA) framework with the construction of a
compact domain sequence that minimizes information loss in adaptations. Our
approach starts with an efficient generation of knowledge-preserving
intermediate graphs over the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric. With the
bridging data pool, GGDA domains are then constructed via a novel vertex-based
domain progression, which comprises "close" vertex selections and adaptive
domain advancement to enhance inter-domain information transferability.
Theoretically, our framework concretizes the intractable inter-domain distance
$W_p(\mu_t,\mu_{t+1})$ via implementable upper and lower bounds, enabling
flexible adjustments of this metric for optimizing domain formation. Extensive
experiments under various transfer scenarios validate the superior performance
of our GGDA framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of static and dynamic batching algorithms on GNN training efficiency and performance, showing up to 2.7x speedup, with results varying by dataset and model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are widely used but the effect of batching algorithms on their training is unexplored compared to other NNs.

Method: Analyzed static and dynamic batching algorithms on QM9 and AFLOW datasets, measuring training time and model performance.

Result: Dynamic batching can speed up training by 2.7x, but the optimal algorithm depends on data, model, and hardware. Some cases show significant differences in learning metrics.

Conclusion: Batching algorithms significantly impact GNN training, with dynamic batching offering speedups, but the best choice is context-dependent.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown promising results for several domains
such as materials science, chemistry, and the social sciences. GNN models often
contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are
often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in
batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on
training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but
not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph based
models, namely static and dynamic batching for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of
small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that
changing the batching algorithm can provide up to a 2.7x speedup, but the
fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size, hardware, and number
of training steps run. Experiments show that for a select number of
combinations of batch size, dataset, and model, significant differences in
model learning metrics are observed between static and dynamic batching
algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proactive longtail discovery process using model-based signals and latent diffusion to generate additional training data, improving generalization without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reactive nature of model deployment by anticipating challenges through proactive data generation.

Method: Develop model-based longtail signals (e.g., epistemic uncertainty) and use Longtail Guidance (LTG) with a latent diffusion model to generate training data.

Result: LTG improves generalization on image classification benchmarks and enables proactive discovery of conceptual gaps.

Conclusion: LTG offers a scalable, efficient way to enhance model robustness without retraining.

Abstract: It is difficult to anticipate the myriad challenges that a predictive model
will encounter once deployed. Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical
approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a
proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during
training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals,
including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic
uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but
can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate
additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call
Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the
diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the
predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG
exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization
improvements on numerous image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed
by a VLM to proactively discover, textually explain, and address conceptual
gaps in a deployed predictive model.

TL;DR: deCIFer is an autoregressive language model for crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data, achieving high accuracy and bridging experimental data with computational CSP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating material design by automating crystal structure characterization using machine learning.

Method: Introduces deCIFer, a model trained on 2.3M crystal structures, conditioned on PXRD data, and validated on diverse inorganic systems.

Result: Achieves 94% match rate on test data, producing structures that more accurately match target diffraction data.

Conclusion: deCIFer is a powerful tool for crystal structure characterization, linking experimental diffraction data with computational CSP.

Abstract: Novel materials drive progress across applications from energy storage to
electronics. Automated characterization of material structures with machine
learning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in
material design. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive language model
that performs crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data.
The presented model, deCIFer, generates crystal structures in the widely used
Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format and can be conditioned on powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on
high-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use
diffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal
structures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing
challenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative
assessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces
structures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably,
deCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental
diffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for
crystal structure characterization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rings, a framework for evaluating graph-learning datasets by perturbing their structure and features, proposing measures like performance separability and mode complementarity to assess dataset quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent issues in graph-learning datasets, such as non-graph methods outperforming graph-based ones, highlight the need for better dataset evaluation.

Method: The authors propose Rings, a mode-perturbation framework, and two measures (performance separability and mode complementarity) to evaluate dataset quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework's utility, providing actionable insights for improving graph-learning evaluations.

Conclusion: The work advances data-centric graph learning and systematic evaluation of evaluations.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and
good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field.
Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and
benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the
graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two
questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we
evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions.
As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not
apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing
that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and
node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible
mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets
based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the
original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we
propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as
evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark
the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We
demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive
experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for
improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research
directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the
systematic evaluation of evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PRMs are limited to mathematical domains and underperform in non-mathematical areas, prompting the need for a versatile solution.

Method: Introduces VersaPRM, trained on synthetic reasoning data using a novel data generation and annotation method.

Result: VersaPRM achieves significant performance gains, e.g., 7.9% in Law (MMLU-Pro), surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's 1.3%.

Conclusion: VersaPRM addresses PRM limitations by excelling in multiple domains, with all resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have proven effective at enhancing mathematical
reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased
inference-time computation. However, they are predominantly trained on
mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has
not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current
PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we
introduce VersaPRM, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data
generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM
achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in
the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a
7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline -- surpassing
Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%. We further contribute to the community by
open-sourcing all data, code and models for VersaPRM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial-scale CFD simulations face scalability and complexity issues due to large meshes and nonlinear physics constraints, requiring innovative neural surrogate models.

Method: AB-UPT uses multi-branch operators for geometry-prediction decoupling, latent space neural simulation, anchored neural field decoders, and a divergence-free formulation for physics consistency.

Result: AB-UPT achieves high predictive accuracy on automotive CFD simulations (33k to 150M mesh cells), enforces hard physical constraints, and trains efficiently on a single GPU.

Conclusion: AB-UPT offers a scalable, efficient, and physics-consistent solution for neural surrogate modeling in CFD, with potential to bypass costly meshing procedures.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for
transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics.
Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts
reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex
geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume
interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must
satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we
introduce Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) as a novel
modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and
prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to
high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent
space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity
outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free
formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of
surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33
thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field
architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the
physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling
divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained
on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and
volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of
our method enables neural simulation from a computer-aided design geometry
alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback.
Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex,
hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose
a simple yet scalable approach, $\mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code
generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code
generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be
recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code
iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on
multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code.
Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the
design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of
$\mu$Code at utilizing the execution feedback. Our code is available at

Motivation: Existing methods for Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) suffer from decoupled architectures and out-of-vocabulary token issues, limiting synergy and transferability.

Method: PromptGFM includes a Graph Understanding Module for GNN-LLM integration and a Graph Inference Module for language-based graph vocabulary.

Result: Extensive experiments show PromptGFM's superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks.

Conclusion: PromptGFM effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches, offering a versatile and scalable solution for TAGs.

Abstract: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text
descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit
distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development
of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and
tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from
decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic
potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens
to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and
incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph
and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose
PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning.
PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which
explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text
space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text
alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph
vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiTUCB, an algorithm for identifying good arms in a multi-objective stochastic bandit problem, with proven sample complexity and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying high-performing arms in multi-objective bandit settings, where each arm's reward is a vector and the goal is to find arms exceeding a threshold.

Method: Proposes the MultiTUCB algorithm, which extends UCB to multi-objective settings, ensuring high-probability identification of arms meeting component-wise thresholds.

Result: The algorithm achieves a sample complexity bound matching existing single-objective cases and outperforms baselines in synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: MultiTUCB effectively solves the multi-objective good arm identification problem with theoretical guarantees and practical advantages.

Abstract: We consider a good arm identification problem in a stochastic bandit setting
with multi-objectives, where each arm $i \in [K]$ is associated with a
distribution $D_i$ defined over $R^M$. For each round $t$, the player pulls an
arm $i_t$ and receives an $M$-dimensional reward vector sampled according to
$D_{i_t}$. The goal is to find, with high probability, an $\epsilon$-good arm
whose expected reward vector is larger than $\bm{\xi} - \epsilon \mathbf{1}$,
where $\bm{\xi}$ is a predefined threshold vector, and the vector comparison is
component-wise. We propose the Multi-Thresholding UCB~(MultiTUCB) algorithm
with a sample complexity bound. Our bound matches the existing one in the
special case where $M=1$ and $\epsilon=0$. The proposed algorithm demonstrates
superior performance compared to baseline approaches across synthetic and real
datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose BeamLLM, a vision-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave)
beam prediction framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address
the challenges of high training overhead and latency in mmWave communication
systems. By combining computer vision (CV) with LLMs' cross-modal reasoning
capabilities, the framework extracts user equipment (UE) positional features
from RGB images and aligns visual-temporal features with LLMs' semantic space
through reprogramming techniques. Evaluated on a realistic
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, the proposed method achieves 61.01%
top-1 accuracy and 97.39% top-3 accuracy in standard prediction tasks,
significantly outperforming traditional deep learning models. In few-shot
prediction scenarios, the performance degradation is limited to 12.56% (top-1)
and 5.55% (top-3) from time sample 1 to 10, demonstrating superior prediction
capability.

### [415] [Scalable Hypergraph Structure Learning with Diverse Smoothness Priors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03583)
*Benjamin T. Brown, Haoxiang Zhang, Daniel L. Lau, Gonzalo R. Arce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSLS, a hypergraph learning method for recovering hypergraph topology from time-series signals using a smoothness prior, addressing limitations like hyperedge selection and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified framework for hypergraph total variation leads to divergent smoothness definitions and hyperedge recovery approaches, necessitating a robust and scalable solution.

Method: Proposes HSLS, a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, with a process for limiting hyperedge search span and maintaining valid selections.

Result: HSLS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, is robust to total variation terms, globally smoothness-biased, and scalable.

Conclusion: HSLS provides a scalable, accurate, and robust solution for hypergraph learning from time-series signals.

Abstract: In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes
from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying
relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by
finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the
extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two
nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs.
However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has
led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing
approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through
generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations,
subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To
this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a
hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our
approach, designated as Hypergraph Structure Learning with Smoothness (HSLS),
addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and
convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved
via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence.
Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the
hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so,
our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The
experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy,
over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we
empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased
towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.

*Carlos Fernández-Loría*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal inference is reframed as a prediction problem under distribution shift, connecting it to familiar predictive modeling techniques and clarifying its assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between causal inference and predictive modeling by showing their shared foundation and making causal methods more accessible.

Method: View causal inference as prediction under distribution shift, leveraging techniques like reweighting and domain adaptation.

Result: Causal inference is demystified and connected to predictive tools, making it more approachable.

Conclusion: Causal inference is a structured prediction problem, and its assumptions are not uniquely strong but more explicit, enhancing accessibility.

Abstract: Causal inference is often portrayed as fundamentally distinct from predictive
modeling, with its own terminology, goals, and intellectual challenges. But at
its core, causal inference is simply a structured instance of prediction under
distribution shift. In both cases, we begin with labeled data from a source
domain and seek to generalize to a target domain where outcomes are not
observed. The key difference is that in causal inference, the labels --
potential outcomes -- are selectively observed based on treatment assignment,
introducing bias that must be addressed through assumptions. This perspective
reframes causal estimation as a familiar generalization problem and highlights
how techniques from predictive modeling, such as reweighting and domain
adaptation, apply directly to causal tasks. It also clarifies that causal
assumptions are not uniquely strong -- they are simply more explicit. By
viewing causal inference through the lens of prediction, we demystify its
logic, connect it to familiar tools, and make it more accessible to
practitioners and educators alike.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-Reward-SQL, a reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL tasks, addressing inefficiencies in existing reward models by using SQL graph representations and a stepwise reward model (StepRTM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for Text-to-SQL tasks suffer from high execution latency (due to repeated database calls) and GPU memory overhead (from LLM-based reward models), hindering efficiency and scalability.

Method: Proposes Graph-Reward-SQL with GMNScore outcome reward model using SQL graph representations for accurate rewards. Introduces StepRTM for intermediate supervision on CTE subqueries.

Result: Outperforms existing reward models on benchmarks like Spider and BIRD, reducing inference time and GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: Graph-Reward-SQL and StepRTM offer a more efficient and scalable solution for RL fine-tuning in Text-to-SQL tasks, improving both correctness and clarity.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text-to-SQL tasks. However,
existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry
reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by
repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory
overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of
RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel Text-to-SQL RL fine-tuning
framework named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward
model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals
while significantly reducing inference time and GPU memory usage. Building on
this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that
provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE)
subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and structural clarity
of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks,
including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Competing risks are critical in survival modeling, especially in healthcare, where multiple event types can occur. Existing methods lack interpretability.

Method: Extends neural additive models to handle competing risks by using dedicated neural networks for each feature, enabling visualization of non-linear relationships.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance on multiple datasets compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CRISP-NAM provides a balance between interpretability and performance in competing risks survival analysis.

Abstract: Competing risks are crucial considerations in survival modelling,
particularly in healthcare domains where patients may experience multiple
distinct event types. We propose CRISP-NAM (Competing Risks Interpretable
Survival Prediction with Neural Additive Models), an interpretable neural
additive model for competing risks survival analysis which extends the neural
additive architecture to model cause-specific hazards while preserving
feature-level interpretability. Each feature contributes independently to risk
estimation through dedicated neural networks, allowing for visualization of
complex non-linear relationships between covariates and each competing risk. We
demonstrate competitive performance on multiple datasets compared to existing
approaches.

*Mihir Prabhudesai, Lili Chen, Alex Ippoliti, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Hao Liu, Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RENT is an unsupervised RL method using entropy minimization as intrinsic reward, improving reasoning without external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward engineering in RL is challenging; RENT avoids external rewards by using model entropy.

Method: RENT uses entropy of the model's distribution as intrinsic reward to reinforce high-confidence reasoning.

Result: Improves reasoning on benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA across various model families.

Conclusion: RENT's unsupervised approach is broadly applicable where external supervision is lacking.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve
significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier
language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems.
However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward
engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we
propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully
unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth
answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as
an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that
yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its
reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an
extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K,
MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen,
Mistral, and Llama families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method
lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external
supervision is unavailable.

*Giannis Nikolentzos, Konstantinos Skianis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Lipschitz continuity of aggregation functions in neural networks processing multisets of vectors, deriving their constants and analyzing network stability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the Lipschitz constant of neural networks is crucial for robustness and generalization, especially for models handling unordered data like multisets.

Method: The study analyzes aggregation functions (sum, mean, max) for Lipschitz continuity under three multiset distance functions, derives bounds, and tests stability and generalization empirically.

Result: Each aggregation function is Lipschitz continuous under only one distance function. Theoretical bounds are derived, and experiments validate the analysis.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the Lipschitz properties of multiset-processing networks, aiding in robustness and generalization analysis.

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important
properties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus
useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior
work has focused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as
sets or multisets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data.
These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function,
such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a
single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether
these aggregation functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three
distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz
constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is
Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions.
Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz
constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we
also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under
distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct
a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.

TL;DR: Proposes design patterns for AI agents to resist prompt injection attacks, balancing utility and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the critical security challenge of prompt injection attacks in versatile AI agents powered by LLMs.

Method: Introduces principled design patterns for AI agents, analyzing their trade-offs and real-world applicability.

Result: Demonstrates provable resistance to prompt injection through systematic analysis and case studies.

Conclusion: Design patterns offer a practical solution to enhance AI agent security against prompt injection threats.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly
versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their
security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are
prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural
language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool
access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of
principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to
prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their
trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world
applicability through a series of case studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores offline RL with small datasets, introduces "Sparse-Reg" to prevent overfitting, and shows improved performance in limited data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many offline RL applications use small datasets, but existing benchmarks focus on large datasets, leading to overfitting issues.

Method: Introduces "Sparse-Reg," a sparsity-based regularization technique to mitigate overfitting in offline RL.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control tasks with small datasets.

Conclusion: Sparse-Reg effectively addresses overfitting in offline RL with limited data, improving performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soft Condorcet Optimization (SCO), a ranking scheme for AI agents inspired by social choice, aiming to minimize prediction errors in agent comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI model and agent evaluation by aggregating performance across diverse tasks using a robust ranking method.

Method: Proposes SCO, a maximum likelihood estimate for rankings, with three optimization algorithms. Evaluates against benchmarks like Elo and Kemeny-Young.

Result: SCO outperforms baselines, especially with missing data (59%+), and approximates optimal rankings closely (0-0.043 normalized Kendall-tau distance).

Conclusion: SCO is effective for ranking AI agents, providing accurate approximations even with noisy or incomplete data.

Abstract: Driving progress of AI models and agents requires comparing their performance
on standardized benchmarks; for general agents, individual performances must be
aggregated across a potentially wide variety of different tasks. In this paper,
we describe a novel ranking scheme inspired by social choice frameworks, called
Soft Condorcet Optimization (SCO), to compute the optimal ranking of agents:
the one that makes the fewest mistakes in predicting the agent comparisons in
the evaluation data. This optimal ranking is the maximum likelihood estimate
when evaluation data (which we view as votes) are interpreted as noisy samples
from a ground truth ranking, a solution to Condorcet's original voting system
criteria. SCO ratings are maximal for Condorcet winners when they exist, which
we show is not necessarily true for the classical rating system Elo. We propose
three optimization algorithms to compute SCO ratings and evaluate their
empirical performance. When serving as an approximation to the Kemeny-Young
voting method, SCO rankings are on average 0 to 0.043 away from the optimal
ranking in normalized Kendall-tau distance across 865 preference profiles from
the PrefLib open ranking archive. In a simulated noisy tournament setting, SCO
achieves accurate approximations to the ground truth ranking and the best among
several baselines when 59\% or more of the preference data is missing. Finally,
SCO ranking provides the best approximation to the optimal ranking, measured on
held-out test sets, in a problem containing 52,958 human players across 31,049
games of the classic seven-player game of Diplomacy.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a uniform bearing-only information filter for state estimation and a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for multi-robot pursuit control, addressing challenges like instability, limited FoV, and heterogeneity. It also introduces techniques for sim-to-real transfer and demonstrates successful zero-shot deployment on AGVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the multi-robot pursuit problem for an unknown target, addressing challenges in state estimation (e.g., instability, singularities) and pursuit control (e.g., heterogeneity, limited FoV).

Method: 1. A uniform bearing-only information filter for stable state estimation. 2. A MARL framework for pursuit control. 3. Techniques like adjustable low-level control gains and spectral-normalized RL for sim-to-real transfer.

Result: The MARL controllers achieved successful zero-shot transfer to AGVs, validating the approach's effectiveness and practicality.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the challenges of multi-robot pursuit, demonstrating stability, resilience, and real-world feasibility.

Abstract: This paper addresses the multi-robot pursuit problem for an unknown target,
encompassing both target state estimation and pursuit control. First, in state
estimation, we focus on using only bearing information, as it is readily
available from vision sensors and effective for small, distant targets.
Challenges such as instability due to the nonlinearity of bearing measurements
and singularities in the two-angle representation are addressed through a
proposed uniform bearing-only information filter. This filter integrates
multiple 3D bearing measurements, provides a concise formulation, and enhances
stability and resilience to target loss caused by limited field of view (FoV).
Second, in target pursuit control within complex environments, where challenges
such as heterogeneity and limited FoV arise, conventional methods like
differential games or Voronoi partitioning often prove inadequate. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework, enabling multiple heterogeneous vehicles to search, localize, and
follow a target while effectively handling those challenges. Third, to bridge
the sim-to-real gap, we propose two key techniques: incorporating adjustable
low-level control gains in training to replicate the dynamics of real-world
autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), and proposing spectral-normalized RL
algorithms to enhance policy smoothness and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful zero-shot transfer of the MARL controllers to AGVs, validating
the effectiveness and practical feasibility of our approach. The accompanying

TL;DR: A transformer-based method (MAT-NAHT) is introduced for N-agent ad hoc teamwork, outperforming POAM in StarCraft II by leveraging historical data for better collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like POAM rely on independent learning, which misses inter-agent dynamics. Transformers' ability to handle varying-length sequences makes them suitable for dynamic teamwork.

Method: A centralized transformer-based approach uses historical observations and actions of all agents to respond to diverse teammates in partially observable environments.

Result: MAT-NAHT outperforms POAM in StarCraft II, showing superior sample efficiency and generalization without needing agent-modeling objectives.

Conclusion: Transformers are effective for NAHT, offering improved collaboration and adaptability over independent learning methods.

Abstract: N-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT) is a newly introduced challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning, where controlled subteams of varying sizes must
dynamically collaborate with varying numbers and types of unknown teammates
without pre-coordination. The existing learning algorithm (POAM) considers only
independent learning for its flexibility in dealing with a changing number of
agents. However, independent learning fails to fully capture the inter-agent
dynamics essential for effective collaboration. Based on our observation that
transformers deal effectively with sequences with varying lengths and have been
shown to be highly effective for a variety of machine learning problems, this
work introduces a centralized, transformer-based method for N-agent ad hoc
teamwork. Our proposed approach incorporates historical observations and
actions of all controlled agents, enabling optimal responses to diverse and
unseen teammates in partially observable environments. Empirical evaluation on
a StarCraft II task demonstrates that MAT-NAHT outperforms POAM, achieving
superior sample efficiency and generalization, without auxiliary agent-modeling
objectives.

rate. HighRateMOS ensembles three model variants that exploit the following
information: (i) a learnable embedding of speech sampling rate, (ii) Wav2vec
2.0 self-supervised embeddings, (iii) multi-scale CNN spectral features, and
(iv) MFCC features. In AudioMOS 2025 Track3, HighRateMOS ranked first in five
out of eight metrics. Our experiments confirm that modeling the sampling rate
directly leads to more robust and sampling-rate-agnostic speech quality
predictions.

*Lu Han, Junqi Zhao, Renhua Peng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: WTFormer, a novel neural network, enhances MIMO speech by combining wavelet transform and multi-dimensional attention, outperforming advanced systems with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-output architectures struggle with spatio-temporal signal integrity in MIMO speech enhancement.

Method: WTFormer uses wavelet transform, multi-dimensional attention, and Conformer for time-frequency modeling, optimized with a multi-task loss and MUSIC algorithm.

Result: Achieves comparable denoising to advanced systems while preserving spatial info with only 0.98M parameters.

Conclusion: WTFormer is effective for MIMO speech enhancement, balancing performance and spatial integrity.

Abstract: Current multi-channel speech enhancement systems mainly adopt single-output
architecture, which face significant challenges in preserving spatio-temporal
signal integrity during multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel neural network, termed WTFormer,
for MIMO speech enhancement that leverages the multi-resolution characteristics
of wavelet transform and multi-dimensional collaborative attention to
effectively capture globally distributed spatial features, while using
Conformer for time-frequency modeling. A multi task loss strategy accompanying
MUSIC algorithm is further proposed for optimization training to protect
spatial information to the greatest extent. Experimental results on the
LibriSpeech dataset show that WTFormer can achieve comparable denoising
performance to advanced systems while preserving more spatial information with
only 0.98M parameters.

*Shunsuke Mitsumori, Sara Kashiwagi, Keitaro Tanaka, Shigeo Morishima*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel method, CATDS, improves low-resource ASR by selecting acoustically relevant donor clips using fine-grained similarity, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource ASR suffers from limited training data; existing donor selection methods overlook clip-level variations.

Method: Proposes clip-wise acoustic token distribution similarity (CATDS) for fine-grained donor clip selection, aligning with SSL models.

Result: CATDS outperforms traditional methods and can use donor languages previously deemed harmful.

Conclusion: CATDS enhances low-resource ASR by addressing clip-level acoustic relevance, offering better performance and broader donor language utility.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel donor data selection method to enhance
low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR). While ASR performs well in
high-resource languages, its accuracy declines in low-resource settings due to
limited training data. A common solution is to leverage multilingual
self-supervised learning (SSL) models with donor languages. However, existing
methods rely on language-level similarity, overlooking clip-level variations.
To address this limitation, we propose clip-wise acoustic token distribution
similarity (CATDS), a fine-grained selection method that identifies
acoustically relevant donor clips for better alignment with the target
language. Unlike existing clip-level selection methods, our method aligns with
the representation of SSL models and offers more challenging yet valuable
samples. Experimental results show that CATDS outperforms traditional selection
methods and can even utilize donor languages previously considered detrimental.

### [431] [DiffSoundStream: Efficient Speech Tokenization via Diffusion Decoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22362)
*Yang Yang, Yunpeng Li, George Sung, Shao-Fu Shih, Craig Dooley, Alessio Centazzo, Ramanan Rajeswaran*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: DiffSoundStream improves speech tokenization efficiency by reducing redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens and using latent diffusion models for high-quality waveform synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of autoregressive token-based speech generation, particularly the slow inference speed due to high token rates.

Method: (1) Conditions neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize redundancy. (2) Uses latent diffusion models to synthesize waveforms from semantic and coarse acoustic tokens.

Result: Achieves speech quality comparable to standard SoundStream at half the token rate (50 tokens/sec) and reduces diffusion steps to four with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: DiffSoundStream offers a more efficient and high-quality alternative to traditional token-based speech generation methods.

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation,
where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred
to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled
autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate.
In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the
efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two
techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize
redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent
diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and
coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second,
DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream
model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size
distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality
loss.

### [432] [USM-VC: Mitigating Timbre Leakage with Universal Semantic Mapping Residual Block for Voice Conversion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08524)
*Na Li, Chuke Wang, Yu Gu, Zhifeng Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Universal Semantic Matching (USM) residual block to mitigate timbre leakage in voice conversion by providing timbre-free content representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timbre leakage in voice conversion reduces similarity to the target speaker due to embedded source speaker timbre in content representations.

Method: A USM residual block with a Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module and skip connection is added to the content extractor. The CFR module uses a universal semantic dictionary for timbre-free representations.

Result: The approach effectively reduces timbre leakage and improves target speaker similarity across various VC frameworks.

Conclusion: The USM residual block with CFR successfully addresses timbre leakage, enhancing voice conversion performance.

Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) transforms source speech into a target voice by
preserving the content. However, timbre information from the source speaker is
inherently embedded in the content representations, causing significant timbre
leakage and reducing similarity to the target speaker. To address this, we
introduce a Universal Semantic Matching (USM) residual block to a content
extractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal
semantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying
timbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content
layer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module,
each dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme
class, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a
stable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain
timbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a
weighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme
posteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks
demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and
significantly improves similarity to the target speaker.

TL;DR: Proposes a Mamba-based state-space model and fine-tuned self-supervised models (Wav2Vec2, WavLM, HuBERT, Whisper) for whispered speech recognition across dialects, achieving top performance on wTIMIT and CHAINS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of whispered speech recognition and dialect variation with low-range datasets and processing load.

Method: Uses Mamba-based state-space model and four fine-tuned self-supervised models (Wav2Vec2, WavLM, HuBERT, Whisper) trained on whispered and normal speech data from Singaporean, US, and Irish dialects.

Result: Achieves best performance on wTIMIT and CHAINS datasets, demonstrating efficiency with low whispered data.

Conclusion: The Mamba-based model efficiently handles whispered and normal speech recognition with minimal data, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Whispered speech recognition presents significant challenges for conventional
automatic speech recognition systems, particularly when combined with dialect
variation. However, utilizing an efficient method to solve this problem using a
low-range dataset and processing load is beneficial. This paper proposes a
solution using a Mamba-based state-space model and four fine-tuned
self-supervised models consisting of Wav2Vec2, WavLM, HuBERT, and Whisper to
address the dual challenges of whispered speech and dialect diversity. Based on
our knowledge, this represents the best performance reported on the wTIMIT and
CHAINS datasets for whispered speech recognition. We trained the models using
whispered and normal speech data across Singaporean, US, and Irish dialects.
The findings demonstrated that utilizing the proposed Mamba-based model could
work as a highly efficient model trained with low amounts of whispered data to
simultaneously work on whispered and normal speech recognition. The code for
this work is freely available.

*Sai Sri Teja, Sreevidya Chintalapati, Vinayak Gupta, Mukund Varma T, Haejoon Lee, Aswin Sankaranarayanan, Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PhotonSplat is a framework for 3D scene reconstruction from SPAD binary images, addressing noise and blur trade-offs with novel spatial filtering and dynamic scene support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering techniques struggle with motion-blurred imagery, while SPAD sensors introduce noise from binary images.

Method: Uses SPAD arrays for high-speed imaging, introduces PhotonSplat with 3D spatial filtering, and supports no-reference and reference-based colorization.

Result: Enables 3D reconstruction from noisy SPAD data, supports dynamic scenes, and provides a real-world dataset (PhotonScenes).

Conclusion: PhotonSplat effectively bridges the gap between noise and blur in 3D reconstruction, with applications in segmentation, detection, and editing.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

*Yuansheng Li, Yunhao Zou, Linwei Chen, Ying Fu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel pipeline for Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) reconstruction, addressing dataset scarcity and degradation challenges with a physics-based model and a transformer-based method (IHRUT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHI's potential is limited by complex errors and lack of training data, hindering performance.

Method: Develops a simplified IHI degradation model for dataset synthesis and introduces IHRUT, a transformer-based architecture for spectral correction and detail restoration.

Result: The method shows superior performance and generalization in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively bridges IHI reconstruction with deep learning, overcoming key challenges.

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UnMix-NeRF integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF for joint hyperspectral view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based segmentation lacks material properties, limiting applications like robotics and AR. UnMix-NeRF addresses this gap.

Method: Models spectral reflectance via diffuse/specular components, using learned endmember dictionaries and per-point abundances for material segmentation.

Result: Superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation compared to existing methods, with flexible scene editing capabilities.

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF advances material perception in NeRF, enabling unsupervised clustering and practical applications.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

*Tianyu Zhang, Xin Luo, Li Li, Dong Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: StableCodec introduces a one-step diffusion method for ultra-low bitrate image compression, improving efficiency and fidelity while maintaining realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based compression methods require many denoising steps and sacrifice fidelity, limiting real-time use.

Method: Uses a Deep Compression Latent Codec for noisy latent transmission and a Dual-Branch Coding Structure for fidelity. Optimized end-to-end with joint bitrate and pixel constraints.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on FID, KID, and DISTS metrics at bitrates as low as 0.005 bpp, with fast inference speeds.

Conclusion: StableCodec enables efficient, high-fidelity, and high-realism image compression at ultra-low bitrates.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

*Qi Gao, Zhihao Chen, Dong Zeng, Junping Zhang, Jianhua Ma, Hongming Shan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NEED, a noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable low-dose CT reconstruction, addressing noise deviation and prior information issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving generalization of deep learning models in low-dose CT reconstruction, especially for unseen dose levels, is challenging due to noise and prior information limitations.

Method: NEED uses a shifted Poisson diffusion model for projection data denoising and a doubly guided diffusion model for image refinement, requiring only normal-dose training data.

Result: NEED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and generalization across two datasets.

Conclusion: NEED effectively generalizes to unseen dose levels, enhancing reconstruction fidelity and performance without extensive paired data.

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for white matter hyperintensities (WMH) segmentation and localization using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs, showing improved performance with multimodal data but challenges in joint lesion-region modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation and spatial localization of WMH are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring small vessel disease and neurodegeneration, but existing methods lack flexibility with missing modalities and efficient anatomical integration.

Method: Proposes a deep learning framework evaluated on four input configurations (FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR and T1, modality-interchangeable) and a multi-task model for joint lesion and anatomical region prediction.

Result: Multimodal inputs significantly outperform unimodal models in segmentation. The modality-interchangeable setup trades accuracy for robustness with missing data. Joint lesion-region segmentation was less effective than separate models.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion enhances WMH analysis accuracy and robustness, while joint modeling shows potential but faces representational conflicts.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

segmentation is time-consuming and variable, necessitating automated solutions.
Materials and Methods: We developed four deep learning-based pipelines for Type
B aortic dissection segmentation: a single-step model, a sequential model, a
sequential multi-task model, and an ensemble model, utilizing 3D U-Net and
Swin-UnetR architectures. A dataset of 100 retrospective CTA images was split
into training (n=80), validation (n=10), and testing (n=10). Performance was
assessed using the Dice Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance. Results: Our
approach achieved superior segmentation accuracy, with Dice Coefficients of
0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 for TL, 0.88 $\pm$ 0.18 for FL, and 0.47 $\pm$ 0.25 for FLT,
outperforming Yao et al. (1), who reported 0.78 $\pm$ 0.20, 0.68 $\pm$ 0.18,

*Ajay Mittal, Raghav Mehta, Omar Todd, Philipp Seeböck, Georg Langs, Ben Glocker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a three-step pipeline for interpretable CVD classification from CT images, achieving higher accuracy than raw CT-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for CVD classification lack clinical interpretability, prompting the need for a more transparent approach.

Method: The pipeline includes image segmentation, registration, and downstream classification using Atlas-ISTN and foundational models to extract interpretable radiomic and geometric features.

Result: The method achieved 87.50% accuracy on the ASOCA dataset, outperforming raw CT-based models (67.50%).

Conclusion: The proposed interpretable pipeline improves CVD classification accuracy and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

### [443] [DIGS: Dynamic CBCT Reconstruction using Deformation-Informed 4D Gaussian Splatting and a Low-Rank Free-Form Deformation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22280)
*Yuliang Huang, Imraj Singh, Thomas Joyce, Kris Thielemans, Jamie R. McClelland*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deformation-informed 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) method for dynamic CBCT reconstruction, addressing motion artifacts and computational inefficiency in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dynamic CBCT reconstruction either rely on phase sorting (ignoring breathing variability) or implicit motion representations (computationally expensive). Explicit models lack spatial regularization, causing inconsistencies.

Method: The proposed method uses a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis function and a deformation-informed framework to unify the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and rotation.

Result: Evaluated on six CBCT datasets, the method achieves superior image quality with a 6x speedup over HexPlane.

Conclusion: The deformation-informed 4DGS framework offers an efficient solution for motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction, with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

### [444] [Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22397)
*Anirban Ray, Ashesh, Florian Jug*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HazeMatching is a novel iterative method for dehazing microscopy images, balancing fidelity and realism without needing an explicit degradation operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cheaper microscopy modalities like widefield produce hazy images; existing dehazing methods prioritize either fidelity or realism, not both.

Method: HazeMatching uses conditional flow matching, guided by hazy observations in the conditional velocity field, to balance fidelity and realism.

Result: Evaluated on 5 datasets, HazeMatching outperforms 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism with well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: HazeMatching effectively balances fidelity and realism in microscopy image dehazing, applicable to real data without needing an explicit degradation model.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

*Xiang Dai, Kyrollos Yanny, Kristina Monakhova, Nicholas Antipa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Single-shot HDR imaging using GRR shutter mode and optical shuffling outperforms other methods in handling saturated pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome motion artifacts in HDR imaging by avoiding multiple exposures and addressing challenges with highlight regions.

Method: Uses GRR shutter mode for varied exposure times and optical shuffling to randomize exposures, solving an optimization problem with a total variation prior.

Result: Outperforms other single-shot methods in high saturation (10%) and achieves 73dB dynamic range with an 8-bit sensor.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers HDR data in single-shot imaging, even with significant sensor saturation.

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

*Chengfeng Liu, Mai Xu, Qunliang Xing, Xin Zou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MarsQE is a two-phase, semantic-informed quality enhancement method for Martian images, outperforming Earth-focused approaches by leveraging texture similarities and compact representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited bandwidth in Mars missions necessitates lossy image compression, but artifacts hinder geological analysis. Earth-based enhancement methods fail due to unique Martian semantics.

Method: MarsQE uses semantic-based texture matching (Phase 1) and texture pattern transfer (Phase 2), followed by a post-enhancement network to reduce artifacts.

Result: MarsQE surpasses Earth-focused methods, setting a new benchmark for Martian image quality enhancement.

Conclusion: MarsQE effectively addresses Martian image enhancement challenges, offering superior performance for space exploration missions.

Abstract: Lossy image compression is essential for Mars exploration missions, due to
the limited bandwidth between Earth and Mars. However, the compression may
introduce visual artifacts that complicate the geological analysis of the
Martian surface. Existing quality enhancement approaches, primarily designed
for Earth images, fall short for Martian images due to a lack of consideration
for the unique Martian semantics. In response to this challenge, we conduct an
in-depth analysis of Martian images, yielding two key insights based on
semantics: the presence of texture similarities and the compact nature of
texture representations in Martian images. Inspired by these findings, we
introduce MarsQE, an innovative, semantic-informed, two-phase quality
enhancement approach specifically designed for Martian images. The first phase
involves the semantic-based matching of texture-similar reference images, and
the second phase enhances image quality by transferring texture patterns from
these reference images to the compressed image. We also develop a
post-enhancement network to further reduce compression artifacts and achieve
superior compression quality. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MarsQE
significantly outperforms existing approaches for Earth images, establishing a
new benchmark for the quality enhancement on Martian images.

*Lorenzo Aloisi, Luigi Sigillo, Aurelio Uncini, Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme is proposed for Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) to improve speed and fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models, though superior for high-fidelity image generation, suffer from slow training and inference speeds, limiting real-time feasibility.

Method: Combines diffusion GAN to reduce reverse diffusion timesteps and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for dimensionality reduction, enhancing speed.

Result: Experimental validation on CelebA-HQ shows the approach outperforms others, ensuring high-fidelity output efficiently.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively addresses speed issues in diffusion models, making them viable for time-sensitive applications.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a superior alternative to
generative adversarial networks (GANs) for high-fidelity image generation, with
wide applications in text-to-image generation, image-to-image translation, and
super-resolution. However, their real-time feasibility is hindered by slow
training and inference speeds. This study addresses this challenge by proposing
a wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme for Single-Image
Super-Resolution (SISR). Our approach utilizes the diffusion GAN paradigm to
reduce the timesteps required by the reverse diffusion process and the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve dimensionality reduction, decreasing
training and inference times significantly. The results of an experimental
validation on the CelebA-HQ dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposed
scheme. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methodologies
successfully ensuring high-fidelity output while overcoming inherent drawbacks
associated with diffusion models in time-sensitive applications.

### [448] [Leveraging Semantic Asymmetry for Precise Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Planning CT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18290)
*Zi Li, Ying Chen, Zeli Chen, Yanzhou Su, Tai Ma, Tony C. W. Mok, Yan-Jie Zhou, Yunhai Bai, Zhinlin Zheng, Le Lu, Yirui Wang, Jia Ge, Xianghua Ye, Senxiang Yan, Dakai Jin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Semantic Asymmetry Tumor segmentation (SATs) method is proposed to segment NPC gross tumors on non-contrast planning CT, leveraging bilateral symmetry disruption caused by tumors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor delineation in NPC radiation therapy is challenging due to low contrast in non-contrast CT, often requiring MRI guidance, which introduces registration errors.

Method: The SATs method uses a Siamese contrastive learning framework to exploit symmetry disruption by minimizing voxel-wise distance in healthy regions and maximizing it in tumor regions.

Result: SATs outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least 2% higher Dice score and 12% lower average distance error in external testing.

Conclusion: The proposed SATs method effectively addresses low-contrast challenges in NPC tumor segmentation, improving accuracy and reducing reliance on MRI.

Abstract: In the radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), clinicians
typically delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV) using non-contrast planning
computed tomography to ensure accurate radiation dose delivery. However, the
low contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues necessitates that
radiation oncologists manually delineate the tumors, often relying on
diagnostic MRI for guidance. % In this study, we propose a novel approach to
directly segment NPC gross tumors on non-contrast planning CT images,
circumventing potential registration errors when aligning MRI or MRI-derived
tumor masks to planning CT. To address the low contrast issues between tumors
and adjacent normal structures in planning CT, we introduce a 3D Semantic
Asymmetry Tumor segmentation (SATs) method. Specifically, we posit that a
healthy nasopharyngeal region is characteristically bilaterally symmetric,
whereas the emergence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma disrupts this symmetry. Then,
we propose a Siamese contrastive learning segmentation framework that minimizes
the voxel-wise distance between original and flipped areas without tumor and
encourages a larger distance between original and flipped areas with tumor.
Thus, our approach enhances the sensitivity of features to semantic
asymmetries. % Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SATs
achieves the leading NPC GTV segmentation performance in both internal and
external testing, \emph{e.g.}, with at least 2\% absolute Dice score
improvement and 12\% average distance error reduction when compared to other
state-of-the-art methods in the external testing.

### [449] [No More Sliding Window: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Differentiable Top-k Patch Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10814)
*Young Seok Jeon, Hongfei Yang, Huazhu Fu, Mengling Feng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: NMSW eliminates sliding window in 3D segmentation, reducing computation by 91% and speeding up inference by 9.1x on GPU and 11.1x on CPU while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D models improve segmentation but increase memory and slow inference due to sliding window. NMSW addresses this inefficiency.

Method: Uses a differentiable Top-k module to sample relevant patches and refines results with global predictions when needed.

Result: Reduces computational complexity by 91%, speeds up inference (9.1x on GPU, 11.1x on CPU), and maintains competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: NMSW is a model-agnostic, efficient solution for 3D segmentation, significantly improving speed and resource usage.

Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing
inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially
increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory
constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding
window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel
end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D
segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW.
NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most
relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level
predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse
global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3
segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW
inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to
8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU
(99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to
189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated
with any existing efficient segmentation backbones. The code is avaialble:

*Đorđe D. Nešković, Kristina Stojmenova Pečečnik, Jaka Sodnik, Nadica Miljković*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores non-contact Pulse Rate (PR) assessment using facial video recordings in a driving simulator, comparing it to wearable sensors. Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) slightly improves accuracy, and age-related PR differences are noted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of wearable PPG sensors (motion artifacts, discomfort) by proposing a non-contact method for driver state assessment.

Method: Uses facial video recordings (RGB camera) and EVM to detect skin color variations for PR estimation, validated against Empatica E4 sensor data.

Result: EVM reduces PR estimation error (MAE from 6.48 to 5.04 bpm). Significant PR differences between age groups are observed.

Conclusion: Camera-based PR monitoring is feasible for driving simulators, offering real-time, unobtrusive assessment.

Abstract: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables continuous and unobtrusive
assessment of driver's state, allowing estimation of fatigue, stress, and user
experience. Commonly used wearable PPG sensors, while effective, suffer from
motion artifacts and user discomfort. This study explores the feasibility of
non-contact Pulse Rate (PR) assessment using facial video recordings captured
by a Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera in a driving simulator. The proposed
approach detects subtle skin color variations due to blood flow and compares
extracted PR values against reference measurements from a wearable Empatica E4
sensor. We evaluate the impact of Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on PR
estimation and assess statistical differences in PR between age groups. Data
obtained from 80 recordings from 64 healthy subjects covering a PR range of
45-160 bpm are analyzed, and PR extraction accuracy is quantified using
metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Results show that EVM slightly
improves PR estimation, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm. Significant
differences between PRs in younger and older drivers are observed in both rPPG
and reference data. The study also thoroughly discusses bias within Empatica
E4. Overall, results support the feasibility of integrating camera-based PR
monitoring into driving simulators for real-time subject's assessment.
