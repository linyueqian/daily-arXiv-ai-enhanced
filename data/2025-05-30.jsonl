Existing methods, primarily\noptimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and\nfail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we\npresent GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and\ntemporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.\nGeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training\ndata and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.\nTo overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to\nestimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then\nconditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as\nan image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of\ngeometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role\nto focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video\ndatasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and\ngeneralizability while requiring minimal 4D training data.

The first phase, Foundational Reasoning\nActivation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and\nstrengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,\nCross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to\nfacilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.\nThe third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,\ncaption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust\ncross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal\nmath reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision\ntest, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on\nMathVista testmini)."}

These \"hidden\ngifts\" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others\nare hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a\nvery simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have\nindividual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if\nall the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.\nHowever, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective\nreward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they\nuse it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents\nhave dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a \"hidden\ngift\". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including\nMARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this\nsimple task.

However,\nprogress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and\nevaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and\nbenchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and\nevaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are\nrepresentative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both\nglobal and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first\ntime, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition,\nit supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone\nformulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize\naccess to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair\ncomparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for\ntraining, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with\nthe goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting\nopen, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at\ndemocratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning\napplications for optimal power flow problems.

Surf2CT proceeds through three sequential stages: (1) Surface\nCompletion, reconstructing a complete signed distance function (SDF) from\npartial torso scans using conditional 3D flow matching; (2) Coarse CT\nSynthesis, generating a low-resolution CT volume from the completed SDF and\ndemographic information; and (3) CT Super-Resolution, refining the coarse\nvolume into a high-resolution CT via a patch-wise conditional flow model.

In this case, their\nlearned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples\nare mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as\na noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is\nasymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit\nmakes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial\ncorrelation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical\nscore and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one\ngenerated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same\neffect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent\nmemorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better\nvariance control under some regularity conditions of the true data\ndistribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be\nreformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential\nDouble-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE).

This\ntask becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models\n(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic\nstructures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address\nthis by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to\nresolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective\ndisambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire\nverification process. To address these challenges, we propose\nVerify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and\ncomprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)\nGraph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,\nforming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and\nunstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively\ninteracts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the\ngraph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining\ntriplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process.

In artificial neural networks, this\nis typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by\ninjecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters\nthemselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as\nserotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn\nweights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.\nRather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we\noptimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To\naccomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as\nthe minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric\nmovement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects\na single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for\na particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.\nFirst, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a\nconvenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.\nSecond, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging\ngeneralization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several\ntopologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.\nnoise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their\nsimplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks\nby input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.\nThese results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds\noffers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning."}

This\nposes challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings\nfor various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various\ndecoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal\npreprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly\ndependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same\npipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same\nexperiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the\ndevelopment of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly\nbeneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with\nvarying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a\nflexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More\nspecifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant\nadaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the\nclassification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets\nachieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and\nBrainLat respectively.

Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the\ndiversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also\nmaintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar\nsamples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.\nThen, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample\ngeneration through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on\ncommonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of\nthe generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly\nperforming RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated\nsamples may lead to better performance."}

Querying\napproaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,\nand without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face\nsignificant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.\nConstructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these\ndimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a\nmulti-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the\nmulti-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space\nensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces\nsearch space through a class-based query mechanism."}

Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D\nspace via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that\nmaps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity,\nindependent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly\nfrom images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model\n(LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we\ndevelop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale\nDiffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as\nour first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTEX achieves\nsuperior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing approaches,\noffering a generalizable and scalable solution for automated 3D texture\ngeneration.

To address this limitation, we present a novel\nperspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for\ndownstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize\nthe three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency\nRefined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on\nclassification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive\nlearning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner.

Specifically, the standard\nDPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated\nloss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the\nunderdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized\nPReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback\ntypes, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient\napproximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the\nsuperiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,\nbinary and scalar feedback."}

In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC\nmodel that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while\nmaintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC\nmatches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or\ndiscriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously\nsuits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two\nbiologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with\nmissing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference\nmore closely."}

Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in\noptimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve\npractical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the\nsubstantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in\ntime-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes\nSentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel\nmodels the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in\nthe pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a\nstrategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers\nan appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the\nscheduling process.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has received\nincreasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including\nlimited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions.\nInteractive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's\nlearning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However,\ninteractive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may\nface challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nexplore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with\nimperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three\nrepresentative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate\ncontrol (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how\ninput characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between\nthem make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural\nnetwork-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under\nlimited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the\nthree interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse\nenvironment.

Persistent homology (PH),\nfrom the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and\nstability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional\nfeature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large\nchange in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and\ngeometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars\nrepresent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical\ninformation of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D\nmedical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological\nfeature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by\nfeaturization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each\nbarcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse\nmedical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned\napproaches on the performance of classification models.

This slow training often leads to the need for\nexcessive communication rounds or increased communication costs, particularly\nwhen data across clients are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we examine\nvarious FL methods that leverage second-order optimization to accelerate the\ntraining process. We provide a comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art\nsecond-order FL methods and compare their performance based on convergence\nspeed, computational cost, memory usage, transmission overhead, and\ngeneralization of the global model.

Although many vision transformer-based methods leverage\nself-attention affinity matrices to refine Class Activation Maps (CAMs), they\noften treat each layer's affinity equally and thus introduce considerable\nbackground noise at deeper layers, where attention tends to converge\nexcessively on certain tokens (i.e., over-smoothing).

To address\nthese limitations, we propose an Adaptive Re-Activation Mechanism (AReAM),\nwhich exploits shallow-level affinity to guide deeper-layer convergence in an\nentropy-aware manner, thereby suppressing background noise and re-activating\ncrucial semantic regions in the CAMs. Experiments on two commonly used datasets\ndemonstrate that AReAM substantially improves segmentation performance compared\nwith existing WSSS methods, reducing noise while sharpening focus on relevant\nsemantic regions.

The innovations of\nChatHuman include leveraging academic publications to instruct the LLM on tool\nusage, employing a retrieval-augmented generation model to create in-context\nlearning examples for managing new tools, and effectively discriminating\nbetween and integrating tool results by transforming specialized 3D outputs\ninto comprehensible formats. Experiments demonstrate that ChatHuman surpasses\nexisting models in both tool selection accuracy and overall performance across\nvarious 3D human tasks, and it supports interactive chatting with users.\nChatHuman represents a significant step toward consolidating diverse analytical\nmethods into a unified, robust system for 3D human tasks."}

Our\nfindings suggest that to solve arbitrary DP problems, the total cost of Mamba\nis still comparable to standard Transformers. However, similar to efficient\nTransformers, when facing DP problems with favorable properties such as\nlocality, Mamba can provide savings in overhead. Our experiments on the copy\nand CoT tasks further demonstrate Mamba's limitations compared to Transformers\nin learning these tasks."}

We\nidentify two underlying popularity mechanisms that induce item unfairness in\nPCA. The first negatively impacts less popular items because less popular items\nrely on trailing latent components to recover their values. The second\nnegatively impacts highly popular items, since the leading PCA components\nspecialize in individual popular items instead of capturing similarities\nbetween items. To address these issues, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm,\nItem-Weighted PCA, that flexibly up-weights less popular items when optimizing\nfor leading principal components. We theoretically show that PCA, in all cases,\nand Normalized PCA, in cases of block-diagonal matrices, are instances of\nItem-Weighted PCA.

In\ncontrast to past dimensionality reduction re-weighting techniques,\nItem-Weighted PCA solves a convex optimization problem and enforces a hard rank\nconstraint.

This paper presents a novel\nwake-informed, 3D path planning approach that fully integrates localized wake\neffects and global currents into the planning algorithm. Two variants of the A*\nalgorithm - a current-informed planner and a wake-informed planner - are\ncreated to assess its validity and two neural network models are then trained\nto approximate these planners for real-time applications. Both the A* planners\nand NN models are evaluated using important metrics such as energy expenditure,\npath length, and encounters with high-velocity and turbulent regions. The\nresults demonstrate a wake-informed A* planner consistently achieves the lowest\nenergy expenditure and minimizes encounters with high-velocity regions,\nreducing energy consumption by up to 11.3%. The neural network models are\nobserved to offer computational speedup of 6 orders of magnitude, but exhibit\n4.51 - 19.79% higher energy expenditures and 9.81 - 24.38% less optimal paths.\nThese findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed wake\nstructures into traditional path planning algorithms and the benefits of neural\nnetwork approximations to enhance energy efficiency and operational safety for\nAUVs in complex 3D domains."}

To address this limitation, we introduce\nOrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object\ndetection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real\nand 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box\nannotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop\nand programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through\nthree applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the\nchart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection\nmodels, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI\nelement detection."}

Current vision-language benchmarks fail to isolate this capability,\noften conflating it with positional relationships and general scene\nunderstanding. We introduce DORI (Discriminative Orientation Reasoning\nIntelligence), a comprehensive benchmark establishing object orientation\nperception as a primary evaluation target. DORI assesses four dimensions of\norientation comprehension: frontal alignment, rotational transformations,\nrelative directional relationships, and canonical orientation understanding.\nThrough carefully curated tasks from 11 datasets spanning 67 object categories\nacross synthetic and real-world scenarios, DORI provides insights on how\nmulti-modal systems understand object orientations. Our evaluation of 15\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models reveals critical limitations: even the\nbest models achieve only 54.2% accuracy on coarse tasks and 33.0% on granular\norientation judgments, with performance deteriorating for tasks requiring\nreference frame shifts or compound rotations. These findings demonstrate the\nneed for dedicated orientation representation mechanisms, as models show\nsystematic inability to perform precise angular estimations, track orientation\nchanges across viewpoints, and understand compound rotations - suggesting\nlimitations in their internal 3D spatial representations. As the first\ndiagnostic framework specifically designed for orientation awareness in\nmultimodal systems, DORI offers implications for improving robotic control, 3D\nscene reconstruction, and human-AI interaction in physical environments.

Leveraging the inherent\nlow-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that\nthe unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the\nunderlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between\ndenoising strength and class confidence across noise scales.

Through\ncase studies on spin systems, sudoku boards, and letter sequences from natural\nlanguage, we identify extremal descriptions that reveal how system-wide\nvariation emerges from individual components. By integrating machine learning\ninto a fine-grained information theoretic analysis of composite random\nvariables, our framework opens a new avenues for probing the structure of\nreal-world complex systems."}

To deal with this more challenging\nsetting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge\nat an optimal $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1-\\mathfrak{p}}{3\\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate\nfor smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed\nalgorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one\nmay want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the\nonly way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by\nrevisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with\nMomentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result\nunder heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove\nthat Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1-\\mathfrak{p}}{3\\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the\nrelaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1-\\mathfrak{p}}{2\\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the\ncase where the tail index $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is\narguably the common scenario in practice."}

Traditional training\nmethods focus on single-stage optimization, neglecting interactions between\nstages. Recent advances have introduced interaction-aware training paradigms,\nbut still struggle to 1) align training objectives with the goal of the entire\ncascade ranking (i.e., end-to-end recall of ground-truth items) and 2) learn\neffective collaboration patterns for different stages. To address these\nchallenges, we propose LCRON, which introduces a novel surrogate loss function\nderived from the lower bound probability that ground truth items are selected\nby cascade ranking, ensuring alignment with the overall objective of the\nsystem. According to the properties of the derived bound, we further design an\nauxiliary loss for each stage to drive the reduction of this bound, leading to\na more robust and effective top-k selection.
