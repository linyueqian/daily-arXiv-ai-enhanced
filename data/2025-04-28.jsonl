The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary\nwith time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify\nthe contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple\nprobabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the\ndeterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This\nframework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly\ninterpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods\nrelying on stochastic inference or adversarial training.

Extensive\nevaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC\noutperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact\nresistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the\nrobustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be\nadapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges."}

Despite recent advancements and the success of different\narchitectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of\nthe real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal\nchanges in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous\nstudies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting,\nlimiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity\nand resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive\nNetwork (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is\nthe Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the\nStyle Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and\nBelongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates\nnon-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by\nblending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization\nwhile maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which\ndynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances\npredictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs\nmulti-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term\ntrends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce\nnoise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's\nefficiency while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets validate CANet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving a 42% reduction in MSE and a 22% reduction in MAE.

To\naddress this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of\nsuccessful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the\nsystem being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game\nbetween capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific and\ndeception-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their\ngeneral intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and\ntask saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game\nNim and then apply it to four oversight games: \"Mafia\", \"Debate\", \"Backdoor\nCode\" and \"Wargames\". For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how\ndomain performance depends on general AI system capability (using Chatbot Arena\nElo as a proxy for general capability). We then build on our findings in a\ntheoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which\ntrusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted\nmodels in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and\nderive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of\noversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success.

Project website: https://murpheylab.github.io/lqr-flow-matching/", "summary": "Ergodic coverage effectively generates exploratory behaviors for embodied\nagents by aligning the spatial distribution of the agent's trajectory with a\ntarget distribution, where the difference between these two distributions is\nmeasured by the ergodic metric. However, existing ergodic coverage methods are\nconstrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control\nsynthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose\nan alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique\nwidely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We\nformally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it\nis equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form\nsolution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative\ninference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were\npreviously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no\ncomputational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational\ngradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the\ntarget distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on\nthe other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an\noptimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on\nnon-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved\nperformance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through\ncomprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics. We\nfurther demonstrate the practicality of our method through a series of drawing\nand erasing tasks on a Franka robot."}

However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from\nperformance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely,\nthey commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which\nleads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In\naddition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby\nignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these\nissues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for\nAccurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building\na singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to\nobtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise\nperturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL)\nwith an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of\nhard and easy sample pairs.

Unlike existing works that rarely take both problems\ninto account, this work considers both and provides an effective solution using\nrecent advances in large language models (LLMs). Our key observation is that\nnetwork protocols are often released with structured specification documents,\na.k.a.

In previous research works, fixed loss weights are\nusually chosen for training optimization, and this setting is not linked to the\nimportance of the steganography task itself and the training process. In this\npaper, we propose a Two-stage Curriculum Learning loss scheduler (TSCL) for\nbalancing multinomial losses in deep learning image steganography algorithms.\nTSCL consists of two phases: a priori curriculum control and loss dynamics\ncontrol. The first phase firstly focuses the model on learning the information\nembedding of the original image by controlling the loss weights in the\nmulti-party adversarial training; secondly, it makes the model shift its\nlearning focus to improving the decoding accuracy; and finally, it makes the\nmodel learn to generate a steganographic image that is resistant to\nsteganalysis. In the second stage, the learning speed of each training task is\nevaluated by calculating the loss drop of the before and after iteration rounds\nto balance the learning of each task.

For both accounts we formulate prototypical\ndefinitions via properties $\\Gamma$ of outcome distributions, e.g., the mean or\nmedian.

Membership inference (MI), which\ndetermines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing\ntechnique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%).\nIn this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current\nMI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member\nimages, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further\nanalyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on\noptimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in\nrealistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and\nnon-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions,\nperforming only marginally better than chance.

To tackle these issues, in this paper\nwe suggest a new method of high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference for\nlatent responses (SOFARI-R), where two variants of SOFARI-R are introduced.

The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified\nunconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the\nextent of collapse. To address this limitation of UFMs, this paper explores the\npossibility of analyzing NC1 using kernels associated with shallow NNs. We\nbegin by formulating an NC1 metric as a function of the kernel. Then, we\nspecialize it to the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP) and the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK), associated with wide networks at initialization and during\ngradient-based training with a small learning rate, respectively. As a key\nresult, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than\nthe NNGP for Gaussian data of arbitrary dimensions. This showcases the\nlimitations of data-independent kernels such as NTK in approximating the NC\nbehavior of NNs.

Converting\nwebsite layout design into functional UI code is a time-consuming yet\nindispensable step of website development. Manual methods of converting visual\ndesigns into functional code present significant challenges, especially for\nnon-experts. To explore automatic design-to-code solutions, we first conduct a\nmotivating study on GPT-4o and identify three types of issues in generating UI\ncode: element omission, element distortion, and element misarrangement. We\nfurther reveal that a focus on smaller visual segments can help multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) mitigate these failures in the generation\nprocess.\n  In this paper, we propose DCGen, a divide-and-conquer-based approach to\nautomate the translation of webpage design to UI code. DCGen starts by dividing\nscreenshots into manageable segments, generating code for each segment, and\nthen reassembling them into complete UI code for the entire screenshot. We\nconduct extensive testing with a dataset comprised of real-world websites and\nvarious MLLMs and demonstrate that DCGen achieves up to a 15% improvement in\nvisual similarity and 8% in code similarity for large input images. Human\nevaluations show that DCGen can help developers implement webpages\nsignificantly faster and more similar to the UI designs. To the best of our\nknowledge, DCGen is the first segment-aware MLLM-based approach for generating\nUI code directly from screenshots."}

Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of\ninter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to\nbiased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional\napproaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers,\nwhich causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label\nthus making all samples similar and less discriminative. To address these\nchallenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and\npropose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and\nClustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i)\ncut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal\ntransport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding\nobjective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint\nnormalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport\ntheory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of\n\"proximity to the pre-learned cluster center\". With the above two tailored\ndesigns, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can\neffectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better\nperformance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is\nsimple but effective compared with benchmarks."}

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better\nadaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method\neffectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear,\nand time-varying grasp systems, demonstrating the generalization capability of\nour neural network and enhancing the robotic grasping ability in unstructured\nenvironments."}

FlowMotion achieves state-of-the-art jitter performance, achieving the\nbest jitter in the KIT dataset and the second-best jitter in the HumanML3D\ndataset, and a competitive FID value in both datasets.

Compared to\nprevious work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the\ncorrelation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving\nmarginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not\nbound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can\ninfer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an\narbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations,\nallowing for low-cost forecasting systems.

This work details our\nmethodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within\na flow matching generative modeling framework.

Code available at: https://github.com/HamidrezaEiv/EquiNO", "summary": "Multiscale problems are ubiquitous in physics. Numerical simulations of such\nproblems by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) at high resolution\nare computationally too expensive for many-query scenarios, e.g., uncertainty\nquantification, remeshing applications, topology optimization, and so forth.\nThis limitation has motivated the application of data-driven surrogate models,\nwhere the microscale computations are $\\textit{substituted}$ with a surrogate,\nusually acting as a black-box mapping between macroscale quantities. These\nmodels offer significant speedups but struggle with incorporating microscale\nphysical constraints, such as the balance of linear momentum and constitutive\nmodels. In this contribution, we propose Equilibrium Neural Operator (EquiNO)\nas a $\\textit{complementary}$ physics-informed PDE surrogate for predicting\nmicroscale physics and compare it with variational physics-informed neural and\noperator networks. Our framework, applicable to the so-called multiscale\nFE$^{\\,2}\\,$ computations, introduces the FE-OL approach by integrating the\nfinite element (FE) method with operator learning (OL). We apply the proposed\nFE-OL approach to quasi-static problems of solid mechanics. The results\ndemonstrate that FE-OL can yield accurate solutions even when confronted with a\nrestricted dataset during model development. Our results show that EquiNO\nachieves speedup factors exceeding 8000-fold compared to traditional methods\nand offers an optimal balance between data-driven and physics-based strategies."}

We present TeLLMe, the first ternary LLM accelerator for\nlow-power FPGAs (e.g., AMD KV260) that fully supports both prefill and\nautoregressive decoding using 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. Our\ncontributions include: (1) a table-lookup matrix engine for ternary matmul that\nmerges grouped activations with online precomputation to minimize resource use;\n(2) a fused, bandwidth-efficient attention module featuring a reversed\nreordering scheme to accelerate prefill; and (3) a tightly integrated\nnormalization and quantization--dequantization unit optimized for ultra-low-bit\ninference.
