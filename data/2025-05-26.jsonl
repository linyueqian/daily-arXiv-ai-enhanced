These\nrights, distributed iteratively by a central authority (for instance, as\ndigital tokens), are intended to enhance fairness in the system - a unit of\nright is required to acquire a unit of the resource, but the rights themselves\ncan also be traded alongside the resource in the market.

Although this\nrepresents a strong attack, it is unclear which aspects of speech are exploited\nto identify the speakers. Our research sets out to unveil these aspects. It\nstarts with kNN-VC, a powerful voice conversion model that performs poorly as\nan anonymization system, presumably because of prosody leakage. To test this\nhypothesis, we extend kNN-VC with two interpretable components that anonymize\nthe duration and variation of phones.

To enable the work, a new\ndatabase of synthesized woodwind ensembles was created to overcome instrumental\nimbalances in the EnsembleSet. For the MSS, a set of ConvTasNet models was used\nwith each model being trained to extract a string or woodwind instrument.\nConvTasNet was chosen because it enabled both causal and non-causal approaches\nto be tested. Non-causal approaches have dominated MSS work and are useful for\nrecorded music, but for live music or processing on hearing aids, causal signal\nprocessing is needed. The MSS performance was evaluated on the two small\ndatasets (Bach10 and URMP) of real instrument recordings where the ground-truth\nis available. The performances of the causal and non-causal systems were\nsimilar. Comparing the average Signal-to-Distortion (SDR) of the synthesized\nvalidation set (6.2 dB causal; 6.9 non-causal), to the real recorded evaluation\nset (0.3 dB causal, 0.4 dB non-causal), shows that mismatch between synthesized\nand recorded data is a problem. Future work needs to either gather more real\nrecordings that can be used for training, or to improve the realism and\ndiversity of the synthesized recordings to reduce the mismatch..."}

Inadequate rebalancing\nnot only results in prolonged rider waiting times and inefficient vehicle\nutilization but also leads to fairness issues, such as the inequitable\ndistribution of service quality and disparities in driver income. To tackle\nthese complexities, we introduce continuous-state mean-field control (MFC) and\nmean-field reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that employ continuous vehicle\nrepositioning actions.

Our framework improves MCI detection performance,\nachieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to\n75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the\ntext unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields\ngreater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight\nour framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection."}

Conventional Deep Operator\nNetwork (DeepONet) approaches employ two inherently limited training paradigms\n- fixed-horizon rollouts that predict complete spatiotemporal solutions while\ndisregarding temporal causality, and autoregressive formulations that\naccumulate errors through sequential predictions. We introduce TI-DeepONet, a\nframework that integrates neural operators with adaptive numerical\ntime-stepping techniques to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical\nsystems while mitigating error propagation in extended temporal forecasting.\nOur approach reformulates the learning objective from direct state prediction\nto the approximation of instantaneous time-derivative fields, which are then\nintegrated using established numerical schemes.

To address this limitation, we\npropose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically\nfor MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and\nresidual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode\nlocal visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align\nwith textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token\nprediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across\nvarious vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and\ngeneration. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of\nobject-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural\nimages."}

To address this,\nwe propose $\\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that\nincorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions.\nExperiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model\nwith better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4%\nhigher average exact match score."}

To address this challenge, we propose a self-learning\nframework for LLMs inspired by human learning pattern. This framework takes a\nfine-tuning (SFT) dataset in a specific domain as input.

We improve agent\ndistillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method\ncalled first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated\ntrajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for\nimproving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight\nreasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both\nin-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small\nas 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier\nlarger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the\npotential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small\nagents.

To bridge this gap, we first formalize\nthe paradigm of long-context reasoning RL, and identify key challenges in\nsuboptimal training efficiency and unstable optimization process. To address\nthese issues, we propose QwenLong-L1, a framework that adapts short-context\nLRMs to long-context scenarios via progressive context scaling. Specifically,\nwe utilize a warm-up supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to establish a robust\ninitial policy, followed by a curriculum-guided phased RL technique to\nstabilize the policy evolution, and enhanced with a difficulty-aware\nretrospective sampling strategy to incentivize the policy exploration.\nExperiments on seven long-context document question-answering benchmarks\ndemonstrate that QwenLong-L1-32B outperforms flagship LRMs like OpenAI-o3-mini\nand Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieving performance on par with\nClaude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, demonstrating leading performance among\nstate-of-the-art LRMs. This work advances the development of practical\nlong-context LRMs capable of robust reasoning across information-intensive\nenvironments."}

By combining\ntheoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small\nTransformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics\ndriving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows\npower laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We\nadditionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we\nconfirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task.

Moreover, existing multi-label methods\nencounter two main challenges in semi-supervised scenarios: (1). Most\nsemi-supervised methods fail to evaluate the label correlations without enough\nlabeled samples, which are the critical information of multi-label feature\nselection, making label-specific features discarded. (2). The similarity graph\nstructure directly derived from the original feature space is suboptimal for\nmulti-label problems in existing graph-based methods, leading to unreliable\nsoft labels and degraded feature selection performance. To overcome them, we\npropose a consistent sparse graph learning method for multi-label\nsemi-supervised feature selection (SGMFS), which can enhance the feature\nselection performance by maintaining space consistency and learning label\ncorrelations in semi-supervised scenarios. Specifically, for Challenge (1),\nSGMFS learns a low-dimensional and independent label subspace from the\nprojected features, which can compatibly cross multiple labels and effectively\nachieve the label correlations. For Challenge (2), instead of constructing a\nfixed similarity graph for semi-supervised learning, SGMFS thoroughly explores\nthe intrinsic structure of the data by performing sparse reconstruction of\nsamples in both the label space and the learned subspace simultaneously. In\nthis way, the similarity graph can be adaptively learned to maintain the\nconsistency between label space and the learned subspace, which can promote\npropagating proper soft labels for unlabeled samples, facilitating the ultimate\nfeature selection. An effective solution with fast convergence is designed to\noptimize the objective function. Extensive experiments validate the superiority\nof SGMFS."}

For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the\nrecognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature\nsimilarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces\nreconstruction fidelity. Our method is highly lightweight, requiring just 2GB\nmemory and 4 minutes to complete evaluations. With our benchmark, we analyze\nthe reconstruction quality of text and faces at various scales across different\nimage tokenizers and VAEs. Our results demonstrate that modern visual\ntokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, particularly at\nsmaller scales. Furthermore, we extend this evaluation framework to the video,\nconducting a comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we find\nthat traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect the reconstruction\nperformance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an\neffective complement."}

This algorithm works by explicitly tracking the constant $K(M)$ to\nlearn optimally, then balances the trade-off between exploration (playing\nsub-optimally to gain information), co-exploration (playing optimally to gain\ninformation) and exploitation (playing optimally to score maximally). We\nfurther show that the function $K(M)$ is discontinuous, which is a consequence\nchallenge for our approach.

Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction\n(LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a\ngenerative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and\nplanned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder,\nwhich provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based\nbatch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal\nconsistency issues and reduce compression losses.

Specifically, it achieves\nflexible tool selection and nested tool calling to address practical issues\nfaced in intricate medical scenarios, including calculator selection, slot\nfilling, and unit conversion. To assess the capabilities of LLMs for\nquantitative assessment throughout the clinical process of calculator\nscenarios, we introduce CalcQA. This benchmark requires LLMs to use medical\ncalculators to perform calculations and assess patient health status. CalcQA is\nconstructed by professional physicians and includes 100 case-calculator pairs,\ncomplemented by a toolkit of 281 medical tools. The experimental results\ndemonstrate significant performance improvements with our framework. This\nresearch paves new directions for applying LLMs in demanding scenarios of\nmedicine."}

To automate the generative process, we propose Semantically Aligned and\nUncertainty Guided AI Image Inpainting (SAGI), a model-agnostic pipeline, to\nsample prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception\nand to evaluate the generated content and discard one that deviates from such a\ndistribution, which we approximate using pretrained Large Language Models and\nVision-Language Models. By applying this pipeline on multiple state-of-the-art\ninpainting models, we create the SAGI Dataset (SAGI-D), currently the largest\nand most diverse dataset of AI-generated inpaintings, comprising over 95k\ninpainted images and a human-evaluated subset. Our experiments show that\nsemantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics, while\nuncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations - human\nability to distinguish inpainted images from real ones drops from 74% to 35% in\nterms of accuracy, after applying our pipeline. Moreover, using SAGI-D for\ntraining several image forensic approaches increases in-domain detection\nperformance on average by 37.4% and out-of-domain generalization by 26.1% in\nterms of IoU, also demonstrating its utility in countering malicious\nexploitation of generative AI.

We propose {\\delta}-Unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for\nblack-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, {\\delta}-Unlearning\nlearns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a\npair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that {\\delta}- Unlearning can\neffectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger\nperformance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. {\\delta}-Unlearning also\neffectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a\nversatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to\nblack-box LLMs."}

The sketch focuses on the risk of an AI R\\&D\nagent inside an AI company sabotaging research, for example by producing false\nresults. To prevent this, the agent is trained via debate, subject to\nexploration guarantees, to teach the system to be honest. Honesty is maintained\nthroughout deployment via online training. The safety case rests on four key\nclaims: (1) the agent has become good at the debate game, (2) good performance\nin the debate game implies that the system is mostly honest, (3) the system\nwill not become significantly less honest during deployment, and (4) the\ndeployment context is tolerant of some errors. We identify open research\nproblems that, if solved, could render this a compelling argument that an AI\nsystem is safe."}

When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models\ntend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this\ndeficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned\nlanguage model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to\ngenerate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior.\nSince a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by\nLLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually\nharmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes\ntruthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language\nmodels, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach\nachieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs.

Unlike Mamba, which utilizes\nLinear Time-Varying (LTV) systems, our approach combines multiple LTI systems,\npreserving their beneficial properties during training while achieving\ncomparable selectivity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed\narchitecture, we test its performance on synthetic tasks. While these tasks are\nnot inherently critical, they serve as benchmarks to test the selectivity\nproperties of different cores architecture. This work highlights the potential\nof integrating theoretical insights with experimental advancements, offering a\ncomplementary perspective to deep learning innovations at the intersection of\ncontrol theory and machine learning."}

We employ Non-dominated Sorting Genetic\nAlgorithm III (NSGA-III) to optimize both pruning metrics and layerwise\nsparsity ratios. Through extensive evaluation on LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral models\n(7B-70B) across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our adaptive pruning\nmetrics consistently outperform existing methods. Additionally, our discovered\nlayerwise sparsity ratios enhance the effectiveness of other pruning metrics.\nThe framework exhibits strong cross-task and cross-model generalizability,\nproviding a cost-effective solution for model compression."}

Previous defenses often\nfail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from\na representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions\ncannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the\nqueries. To address this limitation, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a\nnovel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through\nsafety-aware representation intervention. Built on our analysis of the\nrepresentations of jailbreak samples, the core idea of SafeInt is to relocate\njailbreak-related representations into the rejection region. This is achieved\nby intervening in the representation distributions of jailbreak samples to\nalign them with those of unsafe samples. We conduct comprehensive experiments\ncovering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility\nbenchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all\nbaselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining\nutility.

In this work, we introduce the novel concept of XAI\nconsistency, defined as the agreement among different feature attribution\nmethods, and propose new metrics to quantify it. For the first time, we\nintegrate XAI consistency directly into the hyperparameter tuning objective,\ncreating a multi-objective optimization framework that balances predictive\nperformance with explanation robustness. Implemented within the Sequential\nParameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT), our approach uses both weighted\naggregation and desirability-based strategies to guide model selection. Through\nour proposed framework and supporting tools, we explore the impact of\nincorporating XAI consistency into the optimization process. This enables us to\ncharacterize distinct regions in the architecture configuration space: one\nregion with poor performance and comparatively low interpretability, another\nwith strong predictive performance but weak interpretability due to low\n\\gls{xai} consistency, and a trade-off region that balances both objectives by\noffering high interpretability alongside competitive performance. Beyond\nintroducing this novel approach, our research provides a foundation for future\ninvestigations into whether models from the trade-off zone-balancing\nperformance loss and XAI consistency-exhibit greater robustness by avoiding\noverfitting to training performance, thereby leading to more reliable\npredictions on out-of-distribution data."}

The\nresulting distribution's correctness can be impacted by four major factors: the\ngeneralization and optimization errors in score matching, and the\ndiscretization and minimal noise amplitude in the diffusion.

However, the observed dispersion in rotation rates for\nsimilar coeval stars has historically been difficult to characterize. To\nproperly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized\ndata catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of $\\approx$8,000\nstars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr.\nWe have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which\naccurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can\nbe used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both\ncluster and individual stellar ages.
