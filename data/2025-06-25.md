### [1] [MemeMind: A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Harmful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18919)
*Hexiang Gu, Qifan Yu, Saihui Hou, Zhiqin Fang, Huijia Wu, Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemeMind, a large-scale, diverse, and explainable dataset for harmful meme detection, and MemeGuard, a framework that improves detection by integrating multimodal information and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of harmful memes on social media is a growing issue, but existing datasets lack scale, diversity, and explainability, hindering progress in automated detection.

Method: The authors created MemeMind, a bilingual dataset with detailed annotations, and proposed MemeGuard, a framework combining multimodal data and reasoning modeling.

Result: MemeGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection, as shown by experiments on MemeMind.

Conclusion: MemeMind and MemeGuard address critical gaps in harmful meme detection, offering improved accuracy and explainability.

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

### [2] [Mirage of Mastery: Memorization Tricks LLMs into Artificially Inflated Self-Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18998)
*Sahil Kale, Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often mistake memorization for reasoning, leading to overconfidence and inconsistency in STEM domains, highlighting flaws in current training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs genuinely learn reasoning or just memorize, and how this affects their trustworthiness, especially in STEM fields.

Method: A novel framework evaluates LLMs' generalization and self-knowledge by testing their responses to logically coherent task perturbations.

Result: LLMs show over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments, relying on memorized solutions rather than true reasoning, particularly in science and medicine.

Conclusion: Current LLM architectures and training need improvement to balance self-knowledge and ensure explainability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code
and results are available publicly at

### [3] [Enhanced Hybrid Transducer and Attention Encoder Decoder with Text Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19159)
*Yun Tang, Eesung Kim, Vijendra Raj Apsingekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A joint speech and text optimization method (J-TAED) improves ASR accuracy by unifying speech and text modalities, reducing WER significantly and enabling text-based domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large text corpora and enhance ASR accuracy by unifying speech and text modalities, addressing data scarcity in mismatch domains.

Method: Joint training of hybrid transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder (TAED) with speech and text inputs, using only speech during inference.

Result: Reduced WER by 5.8-12.8% on Librispeech and 15.3-17.8% on out-of-domain datasets via text-based adaptation.

Conclusion: J-TAED effectively integrates speech and text, improving ASR accuracy and enabling domain adaptation without additional speech data.

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

### [4] [Broken Tokens? Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19004)
*Brian Siyuan Zheng, Alisa Liu, Orevaoghene Ahia, Jonathan Hayase, Yejin Choi, Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tokenizers map text to canonical token sequences, but non-canonical tokenizations exist. LMs retain high performance with unseen tokenizations, and some schemes even improve task performance. Robustness arises during instruction-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LM robustness to non-canonical tokenizations and identify cases where alternative tokenizations enhance performance.

Method: Evaluated LMs across 20 benchmarks using random and character-level tokenizations, tested performance improvements with specific schemes, and analyzed robustness sources.

Result: Instruction-tuned models retain 93.4% performance with random tokenizations and 90.8% with character-level. Character-level boosts string/code tasks by +14%, and digit grouping improves arithmetic by +33%. Robustness stems from instruction-tuning.

Conclusion: LMs are less tokenizer-dependent than thought, and inference-time tokenization interventions can enhance performance.

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

### [5] [JCAPT: A Joint Modeling Approach for CAPT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19315)
*Tzu-Hsuan Yang, Yue-Yang He, Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified CAPT framework using Mamba (SSM) with phonological features and think tokens improves APA and MDD tasks, outperforming prior methods on the SpeechOcean762 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective pronunciation feedback is crucial in L2 learning, and joint modeling of APA and MDD tasks can yield mutual benefits.

Method: Leverages Mamba (SSM), integrates phonological features, and uses think token strategies for interpretability and temporal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on the SpeechOcean762 benchmark, especially in MDD.

Conclusion: First study combining phonological attribution, SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

### [6] [Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19028)
*Weijie Xu, Yiwen Wang, Chi Xue, Xiangkun Hu, Xi Fang, Guimin Dong, Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FiSCo is a statistical framework for detecting subtle biases in long-form LLM responses by analyzing semantic differences at the claim level, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing overlooked biases in long-form LLM responses and intrinsic variability in outputs to improve fairness evaluation.

Method: Proposes FiSCo, which decomposes responses into claims, uses entailment checks, and applies statistical testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities.

Result: FiSCo reliably identifies nuanced biases across demographic groups and reduces the impact of LLM variability, outperforming other metrics.

Conclusion: FiSCo provides a robust, fine-grained approach to evaluating group-level fairness in LLMs, advancing bias detection beyond surface-level analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

### [7] [Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19037)
*Omer Luxembourg, Haim Permuter, Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DUS (Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy) improves non-autoregressive text generation by enabling parallel unmasking with minimal denoiser calls, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing samplers for masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) falter under parallel unmasking due to ignored token interactions and dependencies, limiting inference speed.

Method: DUS partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent groups using a first-order Markov assumption, allowing parallel unmasking with O(log B) denoiser calls per block.

Result: DUS outperforms confidence-based planners in math and code completion benchmarks, improving scores without modifying the denoiser.

Conclusion: DUS is a lightweight, efficient method for high-quality text generation, unlocking MDLMs' potential.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

### [8] [NLPnorth @ TalentCLEF 2025: Comparing Discriminative, Contrastive, and Prompt-Based Methods for Job Title and Skill Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19058)
*Mike Zhang, Rob van der Goot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLPnorth's submission to TalentCLEF 2025 compares methods for multilingual job title matching and job title-based skill prediction, finding prompting and fine-tuned classification-based approaches perform best, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving automatic candidate matching, career path prediction, and job market analysis by aligning job titles and skills.

Method: Compared fine-tuned classification-based, contrastive-based, and prompting methods for both tasks, using extra data from ESCO.

Result: Prompting performed best for Task A (0.492 MAP), while fine-tuned classification worked best for Task B (0.290 MAP). Rankings: 5th/20 for Task A, 3rd/14 for Task B.

Conclusion: Multilingual language models excel in both tasks, with prompting and fine-tuned classification being top performers.

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

### [9] [Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19794)
*Yuqi Zhu, Yi Zhong, Jintian Zhang, Ziheng Zhang, Shuofei Qiao, Yujie Luo, Lun Du, Da Zheng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores strategies to improve open-source LLMs' data analysis capabilities, identifying strategic planning as key and proposing a data synthesis method for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks like data analysis, prompting the need for enhancement strategies.

Method: Curated a diverse dataset to evaluate models on data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning, then developed a data synthesis methodology.

Result: Found strategic planning is crucial; interaction design and task complexity affect reasoning; data quality outweighs diversity.

Conclusion: A data synthesis method significantly improves open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

### [10] [MFTCXplain: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating the Moral Reasoning of LLMs through Hate Speech Multi-hop Explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19073)
*Jackson Trager, Francielle Vargas, Diego Alves, Matteo Guida, Mikel K. Ngueajio, Ameeta Agrawal, Flor Plaza-del-Arco, Yalda Daryanai, Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MFTCXplain is a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs' moral reasoning using hate speech explanations, revealing misalignment between LLMs and human moral judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparent, multilingual benchmarks for assessing LLMs' moral reasoning in diverse cultural contexts.

Method: Introduces MFTCXplain, a dataset of 3,000 tweets in four languages, annotated with hate speech labels, moral categories, and rationales.

Result: LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836) but poorly in moral sentiment prediction (F1 < 0.35), with limited rationale alignment in underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to internalize human moral reasoning, highlighting the need for improved evaluation and model training.

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

### [11] [Language Models Might Not Understand You: Evaluating Theory of Mind via Story Prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19089)
*Nathaniel Getachew, Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StorySim is a framework for generating synthetic stories to evaluate LLMs' theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities, avoiding data contamination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior benchmarks by creating novel, controllable story prompts for precise evaluation of ToM and WM in LLMs.

Method: Uses a programmable Storyboard to generate compositional stories, designing first- and second-order ToM and WM tasks.

Result: LLMs perform better on WM than ToM tasks, show better reasoning with humans, and exhibit biases like recency and over-reliance on early events.

Conclusion: StorySim provides a robust tool for evaluating LLMs, revealing performance gaps and heuristic behaviors in ToM and WM tasks.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

### [12] [Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19113)
*Ramaravind K. Mothilal, Joanna Roy, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), to evaluate LLMs' toxicity explanations, revealing inconsistencies in nuanced reasoning despite plausible simple responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift focus from toxicity detection to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity, enhancing their trustworthiness in downstream tasks.

Method: Develops HAF, a multi-dimensional criterion, and six metrics to evaluate LLMs' toxicity explanations without human involvement, tested on Llama and Ministral models.

Result: LLMs generate plausible simple explanations but fail in nuanced reasoning, producing inconsistent responses.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations in LLMs' toxicity reasoning and opens resources for further research.

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

### [13] [Prompt, Translate, Fine-Tune, Re-Initialize, or Instruction-Tune? Adapting LLMs for In-Context Learning in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19187)
*Christopher Toukmaji, Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-lingual adaptation of LLMs for low-resource languages, comparing methods like few-shot prompting and translate-test with gradient-based techniques. Few-shot and translate-test outperform others, attributed to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages for in-context learning, and it's unclear how to adapt them effectively.

Method: Comprehensive study across five languages, three LLMs, seven tasks, and multiple adaptation techniques (few-shot, translate-test, fine-tuning, etc.).

Result: Few-shot and translate-test outperform gradient-based methods; degradation is linked to catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Few-shot and translate-test are superior for low-resource languages; the study provides datasets and models for public use.

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

### [14] [Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19209)
*Yichen Tang, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma, Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method for multi-agent communication in LLMs, improving performance in complex reasoning tasks by transferring both natural language tokens and state transition trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems use natural language for communication, leading to information loss, especially in reasoning or abstractive tasks.

Method: Introduces SDE to encode state transition trajectories alongside natural language tokens for agent communication.

Result: Multi-agent systems with SDE achieve state-of-the-art performance, particularly in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SDE enhances communication in LLM-based multi-agent systems, demonstrating the potential of augmented protocols.

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

### [15] [Personality Prediction from Life Stories using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19258)
*Rasiq Hussain, Jerry Ma, Rithik Khandelwal, Joshua Oltmanns, Mehak Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid NLP method combining sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models and RNNs with attention to predict personality traits from long narratives, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage NLP for personality assessment beyond traditional questionnaires, addressing the challenge of modeling long narratives (2000+ tokens) for FFM trait prediction.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models for contextual embeddings, (2) RNNs with attention for long-range dependencies and interpretability.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability compared to LLaMA and Longformer, validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: Combining language-based features with long-context modeling advances personality assessment from life narratives.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and

*Yuchang Zhu, Zhonghua zhen, Qunshu Lin, Haotong Wei, Xiaolong Sun, Zixuan Yu, Minghao Liu, Zibin Zheng, Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated data can help with data scarcity but risks model collapse. This study explores how data diversity affects downstream performance, finding moderate diversity beneficial and high diversity harmful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked role of data diversity in LLM-generated data and its impact on downstream model performance.

Method: Investigates varying diversity levels in LLM-generated data and mixed synthetic data proportions.

Result: Moderately diverse LLM-generated data improves performance with minimal distribution shift, while high diversity harms it.

Conclusion: Empirical findings provide guidance for using LLMs as data generators, emphasizing balanced diversity.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

*Zhiyang Qi, Keiko Takamizo, Mariko Ukiyo, Michimasa Inaba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoStage enhances AI-driven counseling by improving empathetic response generation using open-source LLMs, addressing psychological state inference and counseling phase alignment without extra training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for mental health care and limitations of current AI-driven counseling systems, such as poor understanding of psychological states and privacy concerns, motivate the development of EmoStage.

Method: EmoStage leverages open-source LLMs for empathetic response generation, incorporating perspective-taking for psychological state inference and phase recognition for counseling alignment.

Result: Experiments in Japanese and Chinese settings show EmoStage improves response quality and competes with data-driven methods.

Conclusion: EmoStage offers a viable solution for AI-driven counseling, balancing empathy and context without requiring additional training data.

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

*Jisu Shin, Juhyun Oh, Eunsu Kim, Hoyun Song, Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an atomic-level evaluation framework to measure persona fidelity in LLMs, addressing subtle deviations in long-form text generation that existing methods miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for persona fidelity in LLMs struggle to capture subtle misalignments, especially in long-form text, leading to unreliable model behavior.

Method: The authors introduce an atomic-level evaluation framework with three key metrics to quantify persona alignment and consistency at a finer granularity.

Result: The framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies overlooked by prior methods and reveals how task structure and persona desirability impact model adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a more precise and realistic assessment of persona fidelity, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona expression in LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS) to quantify feature isolation in LLMs and proposes Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE) for better interpretability and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations in LLMs, limiting interpretability and control.

Method: Introduces FMS to measure feature monosemanticity and proposes G-SAE, which conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training.

Result: G-SAE improves feature isolation, interpretability, and control, as shown in toxicity detection, writing style identification, and privacy attribute recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The findings offer guidelines for advancing mechanistic interpretability and control in LLMs, with G-SAE demonstrating practical improvements.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeilProbe is a framework for detecting pre-training texts in LLMs without human intervention, using sequence-to-sequence mapping and key token perturbations, and outperforms existing methods in black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring data privacy and copyright protection by detecting pre-training texts in LLMs, especially in black-box settings where hidden information is inaccessible.

Method: Uses a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to infer latent features, performs key token perturbations, and employs a prototype-based classifier to avoid overfitting.

Result: Effective and superior performance in black-box settings, demonstrated on three widely used datasets.

Conclusion: VeilProbe is a robust solution for detecting pre-training texts in LLMs without relying on hidden information or manual efforts.

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

### [21] [Learning to Disentangle Latent Reasoning Rules with Language VAEs: A Systematic Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19418)
*Yingji Zhang, Marco Valentino, Danilo S. Carvalho, André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores embedding explicit reasoning rules in language models (LMs) using VAEs to improve generalization, interpretability, and controllability, focusing on disentangling rules and injecting prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMs rely on memorization rather than rule-based inference, limiting their interpretability and generalization. The study aims to enhance LMs by explicitly embedding reasoning rules.

Method: A pipeline for learning reasoning rules in Transformer-based VAEs is proposed, involving three reasoning tasks, a theoretical framework, and an end-to-end architecture. Experiments include disentangling rules and injecting prior knowledge.

Result: Disentangled reasoning rules cluster distinctly in feature space. Prior knowledge injection improves retrieval, but performance plateaus in mathematical reasoning tasks. FFN layers outperform attention layers in preserving rule separation.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning rules can be embedded in LMs, improving interpretability and controllability, though performance bottlenecks exist in certain tasks.

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to predict human annotation disagreements, and RLVR-style reasoning worsens this ability, highlighting the need for better disagreement modeling in LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can capture human annotation variation, which reflects task subjectivity and sample ambiguity, beyond just predicting majority-voted labels.

Method: Extensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to predict annotation disagreements without repeated human labels, including testing RLVR-style reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in disagreement prediction, and RLVR-style reasoning degrades their performance further.

Conclusion: LLM annotators need improvement in modeling human annotation disagreements, as current evaluations overlook this aspect.

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuBench is introduced as a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs across 61 languages, revealing gaps in language coverage and performance disparities, especially for low-resource languages. Multilingual Consistency (MLC) is proposed as a new metric, and cross-lingual transfer dynamics are explored through pretraining experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation datasets for multilingual LLMs are limited and lack cross-lingual alignment, leading to fragmented assessments of multilingual capabilities.

Method: MuBench is developed to evaluate multilingual LLMs across 61 languages. Multilingual Consistency (MLC) is introduced as a metric. Pretraining experiments on 1.2B-parameter models with varying language ratios and parallel data are conducted.

Result: Notable gaps between claimed and actual language coverage are found, with performance disparities between English and low-resource languages. MLC helps analyze bottlenecks. Pretraining experiments reveal insights into cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: MuBench and MLC provide tools for better evaluation and improvement of multilingual LLMs, highlighting the need for addressing performance gaps in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

*Marcos Estecha-Garitagoitia, Chen Zhang, Mario Rodríguez-Cantelar, Luis Fernando D'Haro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores turn-level data augmentation for dialogue systems using commonsense relationships and evaluates synthetic turns using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by leveraging LLMs' commonsense reasoning for generating and evaluating contextually relevant synthetic dialogue turns.

Method: Uses pretrained LLMs for prompt-based generation and evaluation, inspired by Chain-of-Thought, and tests on a novel dataset derived from 5 dialogue datasets.

Result: Preliminary results show LLMs effectively perform commonsense reasoning and evaluation for dialogue augmentation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully utilizes LLMs for dialogue data augmentation and evaluation, demonstrating potential for improving dialogue systems.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

TL;DR: A review of LLM-based conversational agents in education, aligning pedagogical theories with LLM capabilities and proposing strategies for better educational outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between educational theory and AI-driven conversational learning, ensuring LLM interactions align with sound pedagogy.

Method: Synthesizes literature on LLMs in education and pedagogical theories, mapping them to LLM capabilities and identifying gaps. Proposes strategies like Socratic prompting and RAG.

Result: Identifies gaps in LLM applications (e.g., direct answers over co-construction) and suggests practical strategies for alignment with pedagogy.

Conclusion: Proposes ways to make LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive and theory-aligned, bridging theory and practice.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

### [26] [Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch? Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19492)
*Shu Yang, Junchao Wu, Xuansheng Wu, Derek Wong, Ninhao Liu, Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether efficient reasoning strategies in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce behavioral inconsistencies, finding that such strategies increase inconsistency across task settings, training objectives, and internal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if compressing reasoning in LRMs reduces robustness and leads to omitted reasoning steps, potentially introducing behavioral inconsistencies.

Method: Introduces $ICBENCH$, a benchmark to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: task settings, training objectives, and internal reasoning. Evaluates open-source LRMs using this benchmark.

Result: Larger models are more consistent but still exhibit scheming behaviors. Efficient reasoning strategies increase inconsistency.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning improves token-level efficiency but risks introducing inconsistencies, warranting further investigation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

TL;DR: AnTKV is a novel framework using Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress KV cache in LLMs, enabling efficient deployment and high performance under ultra-low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing performance degradation from ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization in LLMs is challenging.

Method: Forward error propagation analysis and Anchor Score (AnS) to identify sensitive tokens, followed by Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization (AnTKV) and a triton kernel for efficient deployment.

Result: AnTKV supports context lengths up to 840K tokens on an 80GB A100 GPU, with 3.5x higher decoding throughput and lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: AnTKV outperforms prior works in 4-bit settings and achieves significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Motivation: To enhance the generation of factual and relevant answers from EHRs by improving retrieval strategies in a RAG framework.

Method: Proposes a query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including existing (surprise, autocut) and new methods (autocut*, elbow), instead of fixed top-k.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved answer quality compared to fixed-k strategies.

Conclusion: The query-dependent-k retrieval strategy is effective for generating better-attributed answers from EHRs.

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual
and relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.

TL;DR: A hybrid pipeline combining NERL and fine-tuned LLMs improves structuring of French posology instructions, achieving 91% accuracy while balancing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: French prescriptions often contain ambiguous or colloquial posology instructions, limiting traditional ML methods. Structuring these is crucial for medication safety and clinical support.

Method: The study compares prompt-based LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and a pre-LLM NERL system. A hybrid approach routes low-confidence NERL cases to LLMs, selecting outputs by confidence scores.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs match baseline NERL accuracy, while prompting improves performance. The hybrid pipeline achieves 91% structuration accuracy with optimized compute.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach leverages NERL's structural precision and LLMs' semantic handling, offering a scalable, accurate solution for clinical use.

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with rapid adaptation to specialized tasks due to static pre-trained knowledge, and traditional fine-tuning is costly and prone to forgetting.

Method: KnowMap constructs a dynamic knowledge base from environmental and experiential data, fine-tuning a small knowledge-embedding model to augment a larger LLM.

Result: 17.71% performance improvement for GPT-4-turbo on the ScienceWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: KnowMap efficiently adapts LLMs to tasks by integrating environmental and experiential knowledge, enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Health Sentinel is a multi-stage pipeline using ML and non-ML methods to extract disease outbreak events from online articles, aiding timely public health intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of disease outbreaks is critical, but manual screening of online articles is impractical due to volume.

Method: Combines ML and non-ML methods in a multi-stage pipeline to extract structured health event data from online articles.

Result: Processed 300M+ articles, identified 95K+ health events, with 3.5K+ flagged as potential outbreaks by experts.

Conclusion: Health Sentinel effectively automates event extraction, supporting timely public health responses.

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

*Debabrata Mahapatra, Shubham Agarwal, Apoorv Saxena, Subrata Mitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCStat leverages raw attention logits for better token importance analysis, enabling efficient key-value compression and high-fidelity attribution without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work relies on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which hide the richer structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits.

Method: Introduces RCStat, a framework using Relative Contextualization (RC) to analyze raw attention logits, with an efficient upper bound for RC.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression (key-value eviction) and attribution performance on QA, summarization, and benchmarks.

Conclusion: RCStat outperforms post-Softmax methods, offering significant empirical gains without retraining.

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

*Lorenzo Proietti, Stefano Perrella, Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines MT metric performance by comparing it to human baselines, finding that state-of-the-art metrics often match or surpass humans, but cautions against overinterpretation and discusses broader implications for the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the upper bound of MT metric performance and assess whether automatic metrics can reliably measure progress in MT evaluation.

Method: Incorporating human baselines in MT meta-evaluation to compare metric performance against human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art metrics often perform on par with or better than human baselines, suggesting human parity.

Conclusion: While metrics show high agreement with humans, caution is needed, and the paper highlights the broader challenge of reliably measuring progress in MT evaluation.

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

*Zhenke Duan, Jiqun Pan, Jiani Tu, Xiaoyi Wang, Yanqing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECCoT is a framework to validate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs, improving interpretability and trustworthiness by integrating MRF-ETM for topic-aware CoT generation and CSBert for causal reasoning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns about interpretability. Existing methods like CoT prompting can produce invalid reasoning chains.

Method: ECCoT uses MRF-ETM for topic-aware CoT generation and CSBert for causal reasoning alignment, filtering ineffective chains with structured ordering statistics.

Result: ECCoT enhances interpretability, reduces biases, and improves the trustworthiness of LLM-based decision-making.

Conclusion: ECCoT addresses LLM interpretability issues by validating reasoning chains, with key contributions including MRF-ETM and CSBert.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

### [35] [Social Hatred: Efficient Multimodal Detection of Hatemongers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19603)
*Tom Marzea, Abraham Israeli, Oren Tsur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach to detect hate-mongers by analyzing user texts, activity, and network, showing improved accuracy over text and graph-based methods across platforms like Twitter, Gab, and Parler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting hate speech at the user level, which is crucial for understanding and mitigating online hate as a social phenomenon.

Method: A multimodal aggregative approach combining hateful texts, user activity, and network context for hate-monger detection.

Result: The method outperforms text and graph-based methods, works across diverse platforms (Twitter, Gab, Parler), and handles coded messages effectively.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach enhances hate-monger detection, is platform-agnostic, and can inform interventions against online hate.

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates self-correcting methods for LLMs to reduce hallucinations in news summarization, using search engine evidence and analyzing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in LLMs, particularly in news summarization, by exploring self-correcting methods.

Method: Apply two state-of-the-art self-correcting systems to correct hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines.

Result: Reveals practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot prompts, and high alignment of G-Eval with human evaluation.

Conclusion: Self-correcting methods show promise for reducing hallucinations in news summarization, with practical insights for improvement.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance goal-oriented open-ended dialogue systems by combining LLMs with RL, addressing adaptability and personalization challenges.

Method: Hierarchical reinforcement learning models structured dialogue phases; meta-learning improves adaptability across user profiles.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LLM baselines in reward metrics, demonstrating effective goal-oriented dialogue.

Conclusion: Conditioning LLMs with RL-based dialogue management improves goal-oriented dialogue systems, as shown in Motivational Interviews.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with an RL-based dialogue manager for open-ended dialogue with a
specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the
structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability
across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and
efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly
between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient
needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster
behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms
a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit
of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPT improves LLM reasoning but generalizes inconsistently to new domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the generalizability of Reinforcement Post Training (RPT) across domains beyond fine-tuning data.

Method: Two studies: (1) Observational comparison of RPT models vs. base models across seen/unseen domains, and (2) Interventional fine-tuning on single domains with multi-domain evaluation.

Result: RPT shows gains on similar tasks but inconsistent generalization, with vanishing benefits on domains with different reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: RPT's improvements are domain-sensitive, limiting its broad applicability.

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

### [39] [Evaluating Rare Disease Diagnostic Performance in Symptom Checkers: A Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19750)
*Takashi Nishibayashi, Seiji Kanazawa, Kumpei Yamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach using HPO to evaluate SC algorithm updates for rare diseases, showing effective prediction of performance changes when frequency data is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating SC algorithm updates for rare diseases due to limited real-world data and high costs of manual vignette creation.

Method: Uses HPO disease-phenotype annotations to generate synthetic vignettes, simulating SC interviews to predict performance changes. Evaluated retrospectively with R-squared metrics.

Result: For diseases with frequency data (n=5), R^2 was 0.831 (recall@8) and 0.78 (precision@8), showing effective prediction. Poor performance for diseases without frequency data (n=3).

Conclusion: The method enables low-cost, pre-deployment evaluation of SC updates for rare diseases using HPO, aiding early diagnosis support.

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of Arabic dialect classification due to the language's diversity and improve applications like chatbots and social media monitoring.

Method: Tested RNN models, Transformer models, and LLMs via prompt engineering on the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets.

Result: MARBERTv2 performed best with 65% accuracy and 64% F1-score.

Conclusion: The study highlights linguistic challenges in Arabic dialect identification and supports applications like personalized chatbots and social media monitoring.

Abstract: The Arabic language is among the most popular languages in the world with a
huge variety of dialects spoken in 22 countries. In this study, we address the
problem of classifying 18 Arabic dialects of the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets.
RNN models, Transformer models, and large language models (LLMs) via prompt
engineering are created and tested. Among these, MARBERTv2 performed best with
65% accuracy and 64% F1-score. Through the use of state-of-the-art
preprocessing techniques and the latest NLP models, this paper identifies the
most significant linguistic issues in Arabic dialect identification. The
results corroborate applications like personalized chatbots that respond in
users' dialects, social media monitoring, and greater accessibility for Arabic
communities.

*Thao Nguyen, Yang Li, Olga Golovneva, Luke Zettlemoyer, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE recycles low-quality web data by enriching it, improving model performance when mixed with high-quality data, outperforming other synthetic data methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'data wall' in pre-training by transforming discarded low-quality web data into useful training material.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, a method to enrich low-quality documents through guided rewriting, increasing synthetic data representation in pre-training.

Result: Mixing rewritten texts with high-quality data improves performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across 22 tasks, outperforming 2x web data and other synthetic methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts via REWIRE is a simple and effective approach to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

*Martin Ratajczak, Jean-Philippe Robichaud, Jennifer Drexler Fox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces bidirectional recurrent attention (RA) layers for long-form speech recognition, matching multi-head attention (MHA) accuracy while being more efficient. A long-form training paradigm and Direction Dropout further improve RA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-head attention (MHA) models are inefficient for long-form speech recognition due to quadratic complexity. The paper explores linear complexity recurrent attention (RA) layers as a solution.

Method: The study evaluates bidirectional RA layers, compares them to a limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and introduces a long-form training paradigm and Direction Dropout for regularization and control.

Result: Bidirectional RA matches MHA accuracy for short- and long-form ASR, outperforms LCA with 44% higher throughput, and Direction Dropout enhances accuracy and throughput trade-offs.

Conclusion: Bidirectional RA with long-form training and Direction Dropout offers an efficient, accurate alternative to MHA for long-form speech recognition, with improved throughput and flexibility.

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Supervised Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a unified method combining SFT and RL for LLMs, achieving superior performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimally integrating SFT and RL in LLMs for reasoning tasks drives this research.

Method: SRFT unifies SFT and RL in a single stage using entropy-aware weighting, leveraging demonstrations and self-exploration.

Result: SRFT achieves 59.1% average accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on math benchmarks and 10.9% on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: SRFT effectively integrates SFT and RL, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

*Abdullah Khondoker, Enam Ahmed Taufik, Md. Iftekhar Islam Tashik, S M Ishtiak Mahmud, Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study enhances communal violence text detection in Bengali using a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model and an ensemble model, achieving improved accuracy (F1 scores of 0.60 and 0.63). It addresses data imbalance and model interpretability but notes challenges in context understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of cyber hatred incites communal violence, yet classification of such texts is underexplored, especially in Bengali. This study aims to improve detection accuracy to mitigate social harm.

Method: A fine-tuned BanglaBERT model and an ensemble model were developed, with dataset expansion (1,794 instances) to address imbalance. LIME was used for interpretability, and cosine similarity analysis identified model limitations.

Result: The fine-tuned BanglaBERT achieved a macro F1 score of 0.60, while the ensemble model improved to 0.63. Qualitative analysis revealed context-understanding challenges and misclassifications.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates NLP's potential in detecting communal violence, though challenges remain in context understanding. It lays groundwork for future refinements to enhance accuracy and societal impact.

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

TL;DR: MAM introduces a modular multi-agent framework for medical diagnosis, outperforming baseline models by 18% to 365%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility of current multimodal medical LLMs.

Method: Decomposes diagnosis into specialized roles (e.g., General Practitioner, Radiologist) using LLM-based agents for modular collaboration.

Result: MAM consistently outperforms modality-specific LLMs, with performance improvements of 18% to 365%.

Conclusion: MAM's modular approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and flexibility, leveraging existing LLMs and knowledge bases.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of visual context on high-resource NMT and its role in handling noisy text.

Method: Incorporates image features into a pre-trained unimodal NMT system, tests with synthetic noise, and evaluates on English to Hindi, Bengali, and Malayalam.

Result: Images are redundant for clean text but improve noisy translations. Full image features work best in high-noise, cropped in low-noise.

Conclusion: Visual context aids noisy NMT, suggesting new research directions for multimodal setups.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress using
large-scale textual data, but the potential of incorporating multimodal inputs,
especially visual information, remains underexplored in high-resource settings.
While prior research has focused on using multimodal data in low-resource
scenarios, this study examines how image features impact translation when added
to a large-scale, pre-trained unimodal NMT system. Surprisingly, the study
finds that images might be redundant in this context. Additionally, the
research introduces synthetic noise to assess whether images help the model
handle textual noise. Multimodal models slightly outperform text-only models in
noisy settings, even when random images are used. The study's experiments
translate from English to Hindi, Bengali, and Malayalam, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks. Interestingly, the effect of visual
context varies with the level of source text noise: no visual context works
best for non-noisy translations, cropped image features are optimal for low
noise, and full image features perform better in high-noise scenarios. This
sheds light on the role of visual context, especially in noisy settings, and
opens up a new research direction for Noisy Neural Machine Translation in
multimodal setups. The research emphasizes the importance of combining visual
and textual information to improve translation across various environments. Our

### [47] [PATCH! {P}sychometrics-{A}ssis{T}ed Ben{CH}marking of Large Language Models against Human Populations: A Case Study of Proficiency in 8th Grade Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01799)
*Qixiang Fang, Daniel L. Oberski, Dong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM benchmarks for limitations like poor measurement quality and unclear human comparisons, proposing PATCH, a psychometrics-based framework for better benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current LLM benchmarks (e.g., unreliable measurements, lack of item-level assessment, unclear human references) by integrating psychometrics.

Method: Introduce PATCH, a framework for psychometrics-assisted benchmarking, and apply it to evaluate LLMs' 8th-grade math proficiency against human populations.

Result: PATCH reveals evaluation outcomes differing from current practices and provides datasets for comparing LLM and human proficiency in grade school subjects.

Conclusion: Psychometrics-based benchmarking (PATCH) improves LLM evaluation validity and enables meaningful human-LLM comparisons, supported by released datasets.

Abstract: Many existing benchmarks of large (multimodal) language models (LLMs) focus
on measuring LLMs' academic proficiency, often with also an interest in
comparing model performance with human test takers'. While such benchmarks have
proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations,
including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are
supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level
(e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?) and unclear
human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?). In
response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from
psychometrics -- a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like
academic proficiency -- into LLM benchmarking. We make four primary
contributions. First, we reflect on current LLM benchmark developments and
contrast them with psychometrics-based test development. Second, we introduce
PATCH: a novel framework for {P}sychometrics-{A}ssis{T}ed ben{CH}marking of
LLMs. PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations. In particular, PATCH
enables valid comparison between LLMs and human populations. Third, we
demonstrate PATCH by measuring several LLMs' proficiency in 8th grade
mathematics against 56 human populations. We show that adopting a
psychometrics-based approach yields evaluation outcomes that diverge from those
based on current benchmarking practices. Fourth, we release 4 high-quality
datasets to support measuring and comparing LLM proficiency in grade school
mathematics and science with human populations.

*Jiazhou Ji, Ruizhe Li, Shujun Li, Jie Guo, Weidong Qiu, Zheng Huang, Chiyu Chen, Xiaoyu Jiang, Xinru Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a ternary classification scheme (human, AI, undecided) for detecting LLM-generated texts, emphasizing explainability and introducing new datasets and guidelines for future detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of distinguishing LLM-authored texts due to nuanced behaviors of humans and machines, and improving explainability in detection systems.

Method: Introduces a ternary classification scheme, creates new datasets, tests SOTA detection methods, and analyzes human annotators' ternary labels and explanations.

Result: Highlights the necessity of the 'undecided' category for explainability and provides insights into the complexity of explainable detection.

Conclusion: Proposes guidelines for future detectors to enhance explanatory power, shifting focus from binary classification to explainable ternary detection.

Abstract: As LLMs rapidly advance, increasing concerns arise regarding risks about
actual authorship of texts we see online and in real world. The task of
distinguishing LLM-authored texts is complicated by the nuanced and overlapping
behaviors of both machines and humans. In this paper, we challenge the current
practice of considering LLM-generated text detection a binary classification
task of differentiating human from AI. Instead, we introduce a novel ternary
text classification scheme, adding an "undecided" category for texts that could
be attributed to either source, and we show that this new category is crucial
to understand how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users.
This research shifts the paradigm from merely classifying to explaining
machine-generated texts, emphasizing need for detectors to provide clear and
understandable explanations to users. Our study involves creating four new
datasets comprised of texts from various LLMs and human authors. Based on new
datasets, we performed binary classification tests to ascertain the most
effective SOTA detection methods and identified SOTA LLMs capable of producing
harder-to-detect texts. We constructed a new dataset of texts generated by two
top-performing LLMs and human authors, and asked three human annotators to
produce ternary labels with explanation notes. This dataset was used to
investigate how three top-performing SOTA detectors behave in new ternary
classification context. Our results highlight why "undecided" category is much
needed from the viewpoint of explainability. Additionally, we conducted an
analysis of explainability of the three best-performing detectors and the
explanation notes of the human annotators, revealing insights about the
complexity of explainable detection of machine-generated texts. Finally, we
propose guidelines for developing future detection systems with improved
explanatory power.

*Karthika N J, Krishnakant Bhatt, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Sanskrit-based segmentation method for translating technical terms into low-resource Indian languages, improving accuracy and inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating technical terms into low-resource Indian languages is challenging due to limited parallel data and complex linguistic structures.

Method: Uses character-level segmentation with a Transformer model (CharSS) to identify meaningful subword units, leveraging Sanskrit-derived segments.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements (8.46 and 6.79 chrF++ scores) in technical term translation. Human evaluation confirms quality.

Conclusion: The approach aids inclusivity and education by enabling accurate, linguistically rooted translations for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Translating technical terms into lexically similar, low-resource Indian
languages remains a challenge due to limited parallel data and the complexity
of linguistic structures. We propose a novel use-case of Sanskrit-based
segments for linguistically informed translation of such terms, leveraging
subword-level similarity and morphological alignment across related languages.
Our approach uses character-level segmentation to identify meaningful subword
units, facilitating more accurate and context-aware translation. To enable
this, we utilize a Character-level Transformer model for Sanskrit Word
Segmentation (CharSS), which addresses the complexities of sandhi and
morpho-phonemic changes during segmentation. We observe consistent improvements
in two experimental settings for technical term translation using
Sanskrit-derived segments, averaging 8.46 and 6.79 chrF++ scores, respectively.
Further, we conduct a post hoc human evaluation to verify the quality
assessment of the translated technical terms using automated metrics. This work
has important implications for the education field, especially in creating
accessible, high-quality learning materials in Indian languages. By supporting
the accurate and linguistically rooted translation of technical content, our
approach facilitates inclusivity and aids in bridging the resource gap for
learners in low-resource language communities.

### [50] [Evaluating Transparent Reasoning in Large Language Models for Accountable Critical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01933)
*Junhao Chen, Bowen Wang, Jiuyang Chang, Yuta Nakashima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REACT is a benchmark evaluating LLMs' reasoning in high-stakes medical and legal tasks, focusing on transparent, expert-aligned logic using annotated cases and reasoning graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' reasoning in critical domains by ensuring transparency and alignment with expert procedures.

Method: Annotated 511 clinical and 86 legal cases with expert rationales, using reasoning graphs for structured, interpretable reasoning. Developed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline for scalability.

Result: Reasoning graphs improved LLM interpretability and accuracy, but gaps remain compared to expert performance.

Conclusion: REACT advances LLM evaluation by emphasizing transparent reasoning, though further work is needed to bridge expert gaps.

Abstract: This paper introduces REACT, a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within accountable,
high-stakes decision-making tasks in medical and legal domains. Unlike
traditional benchmarks primarily focused on prediction accuracy, REACT
emphasizes transparent and interpretable reasoning, requiring models to align
their logic closely with expert-derived procedures. To assess whether LLM
reasoning aligns closely with human experts, we annotated 511 clinical cases
from the medical domain and 86 legal cases from the legal domain, each enriched
with detailed expert-extracted rationales and evidence supporting each step of
the reasoning process. These annotations were guided by carefully constructed
reasoning graphs, which explicitly encode domain-specific inference structures
and decision criteria derived by domain experts. These reasoning graphs serve
not only as standards for expert annotation but also as structured guidelines
enabling models to reason transparently and step-by-step. To address the
scalability challenges of manual annotation, we further developed a
semi-automatic annotation pipeline leveraging expert-defined reasoning graph
templates to efficiently generate new graphs, exploring the potential to extend
our approach into additional critical domains. Experimental results demonstrate
that reasoning graphs substantially enhance the interpretability and accuracy
of LLM reasoning compared to traditional baselines, although significant gaps
remain relative to expert-level reasoning performance.

### [51] [Rational Metareasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05563)
*C. Nicolò De Sabbata, Theodore R. Sumers, Badr AlKhamissi, Antoine Bosselut, Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize the cost-performance tradeoff in LLMs by selectively using reasoning steps, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference costs for large language models (LLMs) are rising with their size and adoption, necessitating cost-effective reasoning methods.

Method: A reward function penalizing unnecessary reasoning is developed and used with Expert Iteration to train LLMs.

Result: The method reduces inference costs by 20-37% (fewer tokens) while maintaining performance across datasets.

Conclusion: Selective reasoning via metareasoning models offers an efficient solution for LLM inference cost optimization.

Abstract: Being prompted to engage in reasoning has emerged as a core technique for
using large language models (LLMs), deploying additional inference-time compute
to improve task performance. However, as LLMs increase in both size and
adoption, inference costs are correspondingly becoming increasingly burdensome.
How, then, might we optimize reasoning's cost-performance tradeoff? This work
introduces a novel approach based on computational models of metareasoning used
in cognitive science, training LLMs to selectively use intermediate reasoning
steps only when necessary. We first develop a reward function that incorporates
the Value of Computation by penalizing unnecessary reasoning, then use this
reward function with Expert Iteration to train the LLM. Compared to few-shot
chain-of-thought prompting and STaR, our method significantly reduces inference
costs (20-37\% fewer tokens generated across three models) while maintaining
task performance across diverse datasets.

*Chung-En Sun, Xiaodong Liu, Weiwei Yang, Tsui-Wei Weng, Hao Cheng, Aidan San, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADV-LLM is a self-tuning framework that efficiently crafts adversarial LLMs to bypass safety alignment, achieving high attack success rates with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for jailbreaking LLMs are computationally expensive and ineffective against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3.

Method: ADV-LLM uses an iterative self-tuning process to generate adversarial suffixes, enhancing jailbreak ability.

Result: Achieves nearly 100% ASR on open-source LLMs and strong transferability to closed-source models (99% on GPT-3.5, 49% on GPT-4).

Conclusion: ADV-LLM improves jailbreak efficiency and provides insights for future safety alignment research.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms
appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended
responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally
expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against
well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial
LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the
computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly
100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack
transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\%
ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving
jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety
alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying
LLM safety.

*Sireesh Gururaja, Yueheng Zhang, Guannan Tang, Tianhao Zhang, Kevin Murphy, Yu-Tsen Yi, Junwon Seo, Anthony Rollett, Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Collage is a tool for prototyping, visualizing, and evaluating information extraction models on scientific PDFs, supporting various models and providing debugging features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accessible and comparable NLP tools for scientific PDFs, addressing challenges like input format variability and black-box models.

Method: Collage integrates HuggingFace token classifiers, LLMs, and task-specific models, offering extensible interfaces and granular processing insights.

Result: The tool facilitates rapid experimentation and debugging, demonstrated in materials science literature reviews.

Conclusion: Collage bridges the gap for non-NLP scientists to evaluate and apply multimodal models effectively.

Abstract: Recent years in NLP have seen the continued development of domain-specific
information extraction tools for scientific documents, alongside the release of
increasingly multimodal pretrained transformer models. While the opportunity
for scientists outside of NLP to evaluate and apply such systems to their own
domains has never been clearer, these models are difficult to compare: they
accept different input formats, are often black-box and give little insight
into processing failures, and rarely handle PDF documents, the most common
format of scientific publication. In this work, we present Collage, a tool
designed for rapid prototyping, visualization, and evaluation of different
information extraction models on scientific PDFs. Collage allows the use and
evaluation of any HuggingFace token classifier, several LLMs, and multiple
other task-specific models out of the box, and provides extensible software
interfaces to accelerate experimentation with new models. Further, we enable
both developers and users of NLP-based tools to inspect, debug, and better
understand modeling pipelines by providing granular views of intermediate
states of processing. We demonstrate our system in the context of information
extraction to assist with literature review in materials science.

*Pablo Rosillo-Rodes, Maxi San Miguel, David Sanchez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores lexical diversity in English, Spanish, and Turkish using type-token ratio and word entropy across diverse datasets, revealing a functional relationship between these metrics supported by Zipf and Heaps laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify lexical diversity in languages with distinct morphological features and registers, using large-scale datasets.

Method: Analysis of six gigaword corpora (books, news, tweets) in English, Spanish, and Turkish, measuring type-token ratio and word entropy.

Result: An empirical functional relation between entropy and type-token ratio is found, supported by Zipf and Heaps laws for large text lengths.

Conclusion: The study provides a quantitative framework for lexical diversity, validated by statistical laws in natural language.

Abstract: There are different ways of measuring diversity in complex systems. In
particular, in language, lexical diversity is characterized in terms of the
type-token ratio and the word entropy. We here investigate both diversity
metrics in six massive linguistic datasets in English, Spanish, and Turkish,
consisting of books, news articles, and tweets. These gigaword corpora
correspond to languages with distinct morphological features and differ in
registers and genres, thus constituting a varied testbed for a quantitative
approach to lexical diversity. We unveil an empirical functional relation
between entropy and type-token ratio of texts of a given corpus and language,
which is a consequence of the statistical laws observed in natural language.
Further, in the limit of large text lengths we find an analytical expression
for this relation relying on both Zipf and Heaps laws that agrees with our
empirical findings.

*Dimosthenis Antypas, Indira Sen, Carla Perez-Almendros, Jose Camacho-Collados, Francesco Barbieri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified dataset for social media content moderation across six sensitive categories improves detection performance when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), outperforming existing models and APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moderation tools lack customization, accuracy, and privacy, and existing datasets focus narrowly on toxic language, leaving gaps in detecting other sensitive content.

Method: A unified dataset for six sensitive categories was created with consistent retrieval and annotation. Fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset was tested against off-the-shelf and proprietary models.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs significantly outperformed existing models (e.g., LLaMA, OpenAI) by 10-15%, and moderation APIs performed even worse.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and fine-tuning approach enhance sensitive content detection, addressing gaps in current moderation tools.

Abstract: The detection of sensitive content in large datasets is crucial for ensuring
that shared and analysed data is free from harmful material. However, current
moderation tools, such as external APIs, suffer from limitations in
customisation, accuracy across diverse sensitive categories, and privacy
concerns. Additionally, existing datasets and open-source models focus
predominantly on toxic language, leaving gaps in detecting other sensitive
categories such as substance abuse or self-harm. In this paper, we put forward
a unified dataset tailored for social media content moderation across six
sensitive categories: conflictual language, profanity, sexually explicit
material, drug-related content, self-harm, and spam. By collecting and
annotating data with consistent retrieval strategies and guidelines, we address
the shortcomings of previous focalised research. Our analysis demonstrates that
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on this novel dataset yields
significant improvements in detection performance compared to open
off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA, and even proprietary OpenAI models, which
underperform by 10-15% overall. This limitation is even more pronounced on
popular moderation APIs, which cannot be easily tailored to specific sensitive
content categories, among others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' ability to detect and explain human- vs. LLM-generated texts, finding self-detection better than cross-detection but still suboptimal. Ternary classification improves accuracy and explanation quality, though issues like hallucinations persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risks of LLM misuse by improving detection and explanation of LLM-generated texts.

Method: Evaluated 6 LLMs in binary and ternary classification settings, using human-annotated data for quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: Self-detection outperforms cross-detection, but both are suboptimal. Ternary classification boosts accuracy and explanation quality. Key failures include reliance on inaccurate features and hallucinations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in self-detection and self-explanation, calling for research to improve generalizability and reduce overfitting.

Abstract: Distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated texts is crucial given the
risks associated with misuse of LLMs. This paper investigates detection and
explanation capabilities of current LLMs across two settings: binary (human vs.
LLM-generated) and ternary classification (including an ``undecided'' class).
We evaluate 6 close- and open-source LLMs of varying sizes and find that
self-detection (LLMs identifying their own outputs) consistently outperforms
cross-detection (identifying outputs from other LLMs), though both remain
suboptimal. Introducing a ternary classification framework improves both
detection accuracy and explanation quality across all models. Through
comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses using our human-annotated
dataset, we identify key explanation failures, primarily reliance on inaccurate
features, hallucinations, and flawed reasoning. Our findings underscore the
limitations of current LLMs in self-detection and self-explanation,
highlighting the need for further research to address overfitting and enhance
generalizability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM re-rankers are evaluated for RAG, showing they struggle to outperform BM25 on DRUID due to lexical dissimilarities, with improvements mainly for NQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LM re-rankers consistently outperform lexical methods like BM25 in processing semantic information and query-answer relations.

Method: Evaluation of 6 LM re-rankers on NQ, LitQA2, and DRUID datasets using a novel BM25-based separation metric to identify errors.

Result: LM re-rankers underperform BM25 on DRUID, with improvements only effective for NQ. Errors are linked to lexical dissimilarities.

Conclusion: LM re-rankers have weaknesses, highlighting the need for more adversarial and realistic datasets for evaluation.

Abstract: Language model (LM) re-rankers are used to refine retrieval results for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). They are more expensive than lexical
matching methods like BM25 but assumed to better process semantic information
and the relations between the query and the retrieved answers. To understand
whether LM re-rankers always live up to this assumption, we evaluate 6
different LM re-rankers on the NQ, LitQA2 and DRUID datasets. Our results show
that LM re-rankers struggle to outperform a simple BM25 baseline on DRUID.
Leveraging a novel separation metric based on BM25 scores, we explain and
identify re-ranker errors stemming from lexical dissimilarities. We also
investigate different methods to improve LM re-ranker performance and find
these methods mainly useful for NQ. Taken together, our work identifies and
explains weaknesses of LM re-rankers and points to the need for more
adversarial and realistic datasets for their evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified fine-tuning framework for LLM-based mobility prediction is proposed, outperforming existing models in accuracy and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based mobility models struggle with adaptability across cities and diverse user contexts.

Method: Proposes a unified fine-tuning framework for an open-source LLM, tested on six real-world mobility datasets.

Result: Achieved superior prediction accuracy and transferability compared to state-of-the-art deep learning and LLM models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses adaptability issues, enhancing LLM-based mobility prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to domain-specific tasks due
to their massive general knowledge and remarkable inference capacities. Current
studies on LLMs have shown immense potential in applying LLMs to model
individual mobility prediction problems. However, most LLM-based mobility
prediction models only train on specific datasets or use single well-designed
prompts, leading to difficulty in adapting to different cities and users with
diverse contexts. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a unified fine-tuning
framework to train a foundational open source LLM-based mobility prediction
model. We conducted extensive experiments on six real-world mobility datasets
to validate the proposed model. The results showed that the proposed model
achieved the best performance in prediction accuracy and transferability over
state-of-the-art models based on deep learning and LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can perform span annotation tasks comparably to humans at lower cost, as shown in three diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Span annotation is crucial for analyzing high-quality texts, but traditionally relies on humans or fine-tuned models. This study explores LLMs as a cost-effective alternative.

Method: LLMs are compared to human annotators on three span annotation tasks: data-to-text evaluation, translation error identification, and propaganda detection.

Result: LLMs achieve human-level inter-annotator agreement at a fraction of the cost and make errors at similar rates.

Conclusion: LLMs are a viable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for span annotation, with potential for further research.

Abstract: Span annotation is the task of localizing and classifying text spans
according to custom guidelines. Annotated spans can be used to analyze and
evaluate high-quality texts for which single-score metrics fail to provide
actionable feedback. Until recently, span annotation was limited to human
annotators or fine-tuned models. In this study, we show that large language
models (LLMs) can serve as flexible and cost-effective span annotation
backbones. To demonstrate their utility, we compare LLMs to skilled human
annotators on three diverse span annotation tasks: evaluating data-to-text
generation, identifying translation errors, and detecting propaganda
techniques. We demonstrate that LLMs achieve inter-annotator agreement (IAA)
comparable to human annotators at a fraction of a cost per output annotation.
We also manually analyze model outputs, finding that LLMs make errors at a
similar rate to human annotators. We release the dataset of more than 40k model
and human annotations for further research.

*Chenghao Xiao, Hou Pong Chan, Hao Zhang, Mahani Aljunied, Lidong Bing, Noura Al Moubayed, Yu Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across languages, revealing key findings about their internal representations and proposing methods to reduce hallucination risks in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' knowledge boundaries is crucial to prevent hallucinations, but prior research has focused mainly on English. This work addresses the gap by analyzing cross-lingual knowledge boundaries.

Method: The study probes LLMs' internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages, identifies perception patterns, and proposes a training-free alignment method. Fine-tuning on bilingual question pairs is also tested.

Result: Key findings: 1) Knowledge boundary perceptions are encoded in middle-upper layers. 2) Language differences follow a linear structure, enabling cross-lingual transfer. 3) Fine-tuning enhances boundary recognition. A multilingual evaluation suite is introduced.

Conclusion: The study advances cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis, offering practical methods to reduce hallucinations in low-resource languages and providing a publicly available evaluation suite.

Abstract: While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent
hallucination, research on the knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly
focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how
LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their
internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in
multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs'
perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper
layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge
boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of
a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary
perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk
in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair
translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across
languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge
boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising
three representative types of knowledge boundary data. Our code and datasets
are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper separates biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets, revealing only 32.8% require complex reasoning. It evaluates models, showing gaps in reasoning vs. knowledge performance, and introduces BioMed-R1, a model trained for reasoning-heavy tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks mix reasoning with factual recall, limiting the evaluation of true medical reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Uses a PubMedBERT classifier to split benchmarks, evaluates models on reasoning and knowledge, and trains BioMed-R1 with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Only 32.8% of questions require reasoning; biomedical models lag in reasoning, while general models are more robust. BioMed-R1 outperforms similarly sized models.

Conclusion: Improving medical reasoning in LLMs requires focused training on reasoning-heavy tasks and adversarial scenarios, with potential gains from clinical case reports.

Abstract: Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians'
diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and
PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating
11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using
a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human
performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require
complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1)
and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent
gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1
scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where
models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade
sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To

*Lujun Li, Lama Sleem, Niccolo' Gentile, Geoffrey Nichil, Radu State*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning for smaller transformer models in text classification tasks, focusing on industrial applications like email and legal document categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and resource-heavy nature of large models like ChatGPT and Llama in text classification, and explore the potential of smaller models.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text classification in industrial scenarios.

Result: Examines performance and efficiency (e.g., VRAM usage) of smaller models, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Provides insights for deploying compact models locally in industrial settings, balancing performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced
text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama
exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency
on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text
classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their
substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus,
the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively
handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest.
However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text
classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios,
including email classification, legal document categorization, and the
classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and
limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their
performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM)
utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and
application of compact models in industrial settings.

*Jiayi Tian, Ryan Solgi, Jinming Lu, Yifan Yang, Hai Li, Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLAT-LLM is a training-free, fine-grained low-rank compression method for LLMs, improving efficiency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational and memory demands of LLMs in resource-constrained environments, while avoiding accuracy degradation and expensive calibration.

Method: Uses head-wise PCA for low-rank transformations in activation space, adaptively allocating ranks across decoders.

Result: Outperforms structural pruning and decomposition methods in generalization and speed, with fast calibration.

Conclusion: FLAT-LLM offers a practical, efficient solution for compressing LLMs without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural
language processing, yet their high computational and memory demands pose
challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Although recent
low-rank decomposition methods offer a promising path for structural
compression, they often suffer from accuracy degradation, expensive calibration
procedures, and result in inefficient model architectures that hinder
real-world inference speedups. In this paper, we propose FLAT-LLM, a fast and
accurate, training-free structural compression method based on fine-grained
low-rank transformations in the activation space. Specifically, we reduce the
hidden dimension by transforming the weights using truncated eigenvectors
computed via head-wise Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employ an
importance-based metric to adaptively allocate ranks across decoders. FLAT-LLM
achieves efficient and effective weight compression without recovery
fine-tuning, which could complete the calibration within a few minutes.
Evaluated across 4 models and 11 datasets, FLAT-LLM outperforms structural
pruning baselines in generalization and downstream performance, while
delivering inference speedups over decomposition-based methods.

### [64] [Transferring Features Across Language Models With Model Stitching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06609)
*Alan Chen, Jack Merullo, Alessandro Stolfo, Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Affine mappings between residual streams of language models enable cheap feature transfer, improving SAE training efficiency by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the transferability of features between small and large language models and reduce computational costs of training expensive components like SAEs.

Method: Use affine mappings to transfer SAE weights between models of different sizes, analyze representation spaces, and evaluate feature-level transferability.

Result: Small and large models learn similar representation spaces; transferring SAEs saves 50% FLOPs. Transferred probes and steering vectors recover ground truth performance.

Conclusion: Affine mappings reveal similarities and differences in model representations, offering a method to enhance SAE training efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. In
particular, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead
to 50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the issue of reward hacking in LLMs for math problem-solving, introduces MathOlympiadEval dataset, and proposes ParaStepVerifier for step-by-step verification to improve reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce correct answers via flawed reasoning (reward hacking), which existing methods fail to detect reliably.

Method: Introduces MathOlympiadEval dataset and ParaStepVerifier, a step-by-step verification tool for mathematical solutions.

Result: ParaStepVerifier outperforms baselines in detecting flawed reasoning, especially in complex problems.

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier provides a robust method for evaluating and training LLMs to ensure genuine mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance German NLP by leveraging updated architectures and tailored datasets for German language characteristics.

Method: Pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus with Whole Word Masking (WWM). Extended-input variants derived using Nyströmformer and Longformer.

Result: Achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among base models and setting new SOTA. Base models outperformed larger models in several tasks.

Conclusion: GeistBERT is released under MIT license to support the German NLP research community.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

*Pavlo Vasylenko, Marcos Treviso, André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASEntmax, a sparse attention mechanism using α-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, to improve focus on fixed-size patterns in transformers. It outperforms traditional softmax and other baselines in long-context generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional softmax attention in transformers disperses attention probability mass over non-informative tokens, harming tasks requiring precise focus on fixed-size patterns.

Method: Proposes ASEntmax, which combines α-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, and integrates it with optimized position encodings.

Result: ASEntmax outperforms softmax, scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature α-entmax baselines in long-context generalization.

Conclusion: Sparse attention mechanisms like ASEntmax, combined with proper position encodings, enhance transformer performance for tasks needing precise pattern focus.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAG-Thinker upgrades KAG to a multi-turn interactive reasoning framework using a lightweight LLM, enhancing logical coherence in Q&A tasks by decomposing questions into solvable sub-problems and modeling dependencies explicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve logical coherence and contextual consistency in reasoning for complex Q&A tasks on domain-specific KBs within LLMs.

Method: Decomposes questions into logical forms (natural language and logical function), classifies tasks as retrieval or reasoning, and models dependencies via logical interfaces. Uses knowledge boundary and depth solving modules for optimal source selection and comprehensive knowledge acquisition.

Result: Enhanced reasoning process with structured thinking, improved retrieval, and analysis capabilities in domain-specific Q&A tasks.

Conclusion: KAG-Thinker effectively structures reasoning, improves logical coherence, and optimizes knowledge retrieval and analysis for complex Q&A tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, which upgrade KAG to a multi-turn
interactive thinking and deep reasoning framework powered by a dedicated
parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach constructs a
structured thinking process for solving complex problems, enhancing the the
logical coherence and contextual consistency of the reasoning process in
question-answering (Q&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs) within
LLMs. Following the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning
technology route of KAG, this framework first decomposes complex questions into
independently solvable sub-problems (which are also referred to as logical
forms) through \textbf{breadth decomposition}. Each such logical form is
represented in two equivalent forms-natural language and logical function-and
subsequently classified as either a Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis
task. Dependencies and parameter passing between these tasks are explicitly
modeled via logical function interfaces. In the solving process, the Retrieval
function performs retrieval tasks. It retrieves one-hop structured and
unstructured information of specified knowledge unit. While the Math and Deduce
functions are used to perform reasoning analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth
noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external
knowledge sources are regarded as equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge
boundary} module to determine the optimal source using self-regulatory
mechanisms such as confidence calibration and reflective reasoning, and use the
\textbf{depth solving} module to enhance the comprehensiveness of knowledge
acquisition...

Motivation: Existing tokenizers favor high-resource languages, disadvantaging diverse and morphologically rich languages like those in the Indian subcontinent.

Method: Intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies, comparing BPE and Unigram LM algorithms, vocabulary sizes, and multilingual training approaches (joint and cluster-based).

Result: Low-resource languages benefit from tokenizers trained on related high-resource languages, with insights on trade-offs between methods.

Conclusion: The study offers practical guidance for fairer, more efficient, and linguistically informed multilingual tokenizers.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed
tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) framework to evaluate LLM-generated text quality, addressing limitations of current methods like single-metric reliance and lack of statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM-generated text are inadequate, failing to capture nuanced trade-offs between quality indicators like coherence and diversity.

Method: Adapts the GSD framework for statistical inference, enabling multi-dimensional evaluation without arbitrary metric weighting.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's ability to identify statistically significant performance differences in decoding strategies compared to human text.

Conclusion: The GSD-front approach provides a robust, multi-dimensional evaluation method for LLM-generated text, overcoming key limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on content knowledge, neglecting pedagogical understanding. This gap hinders AI's potential in education, necessitating benchmarks to assess models' teaching-related knowledge.

Method: The benchmark uses questions from professional teacher exams, covering pedagogical subdomains like teaching strategies and assessment methods. It evaluates 97 models on Cross-Domain Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) knowledge.

Result: Model accuracies ranged from 28% to 89% on pedagogical questions. The study analyzes cost-accuracy trade-offs and tracks Pareto frontier progression over time.

Conclusion: Pedagogy benchmarks are vital for responsible AI deployment in education, guiding development and policy. They ensure models understand teaching concepts and support diverse learning needs.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

*Yiran Zhou, Yingyu Wang, Shoudong Huang, Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel correspondence-free multiview point cloud registration method is introduced, leveraging raw depth information for joint pose and global map estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on feature extraction and data association, which struggle to achieve global optimal solutions in complex environments.

Method: Represent the global map as a depth map and use raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least squares optimisation for joint pose and map estimation, bypassing explicit feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, especially in challenging environments where feature extraction is difficult.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust alternative to traditional feature-based approaches, improving registration accuracy in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

TL;DR: An enhanced YOLOv8 framework for real-time vehicle detection, classification, and carbon emission estimation, integrating deep OCR for license plate recognition and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the accuracy of vehicle-specific carbon emission monitoring in urban environments by combining real-time object detection with deep OCR.

Method: Enhanced YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and segmentation, a hybrid pipeline for tracking and cropping detected vehicles, and a deep OCR module for license plate recognition. Validation is done via an external API.

Result: YOLOv8 achieved ~71% mAP for bounding boxes and ~70% for segmentation. OCR accuracy reached 99%.

Conclusion: The framework is feasible for smart transportation systems, providing scalable, automated carbon emission monitoring.

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision-based method is introduced to objectively quantify Parkinson's disease motor characteristics from video recordings, improving accuracy and interpretability over subjective clinical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective clinical evaluations of Parkinson's disease motor characteristics are prone to variability and lack granularity, necessitating an objective, quantifiable method.

Method: The paper proposes a granular computer vision-based approach using four sets of clinically relevant features to analyze video recordings of PD patients' finger-tapping tests.

Result: The method identifies four motor deficits and achieves higher accuracy in predicting MDS-UPDRS scores compared to existing approaches, while providing interpretable results.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, objective solution for assessing PD motor characteristics, applicable in clinical and remote settings, with future work needed to evaluate its responsiveness to treatment and disease progression.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based framework using Q-Learning for segment-wise tracking of tubular structures, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational inefficiency and reliance on prior knowledge in segment-wise tracking of complex tubular structures like blood vessels and roads.

Method: Proposes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework with Q-Learning to dynamically explore segment graphs, computing edge weights on-demand.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise methods, handling complex topologies and maintaining global coherence without extensive prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust and efficient solution for tracking tubular structures, adaptable to incomplete initial information.

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

TL;DR: An AI-based automated safety monitoring system for tower cranes integrates camera and LiDAR data to protect workers and prevent collisions, proving effective in real-site testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for advanced safety measures in automated tower crane operations, especially for human protection and collision avoidance in Modular Integrated Construction (MiC).

Method: Developed a system using 3D data fusion from camera and LiDAR, integrating state-of-the-art methods into a software pipeline with hardware and display systems.

Result: Achieved accurate localization of humans and MiCs, with real-site visualization confirming system effectiveness.

Conclusion: The system serves as a valuable safety monitoring toolkit for construction sites.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the

### [77] [Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18939)
*Rui An, Yifeng Zhang, Ziran Liang, Wenqi Fan, Yuxuan Liang, Xuequn Shang, Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Damba-ST is a domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction, addressing computational and generalization challenges of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generalizable urban spatio-temporal models is crucial for deploying services in data-scarce regions, but current Transformer-based models face scalability issues.

Method: Proposes Damba-ST, leveraging Mamba's linear complexity, with domain-adaptive state space models and Domain Adapters to handle heterogeneity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in new urban environments without retraining.

Conclusion: Damba-ST offers a scalable and efficient solution for urban spatio-temporal prediction with robust cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

*Andrew Kiruluta, Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDict-VLM replaces convolutions and self-attention with a spectral dictionary token mixer, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify vision-language models by eliminating computationally intensive components like convolutions and self-attention while maintaining performance.

Method: Introduces a spectral dictionary token mixer, representing image patches or wordpieces as sparse combinations of learnable frequency atoms.

Result: Achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, SPICE of 27.0 on MS-COCO, and 50.3% accuracy on VQAv2, with 60% fewer parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: SDict-VLM offers an efficient, interpretable alternative to traditional VLMs, with tunable accuracy-compute trade-offs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

*Zhe Dong, Yuzhe Sun, Tianzhu Liu, Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRIS leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for precise remote sensing image segmentation, introducing CP-adapter and PCMRD for enhanced cross-modal alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS approaches struggle with aerial imagery due to scale variations, diverse orientations, and semantic ambiguities.

Method: Proposes DiffRIS with CP-adapter for dynamic linguistic refinement and PCMRD for iterative text-visual alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, RISBench), setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: DiffRIS effectively bridges vision-language gaps in remote sensing, validating the use of pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

*Guanxi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE is a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for visualizing visual and textual saliency in LVLMs during VQA, outperforming prior methods in human-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where LVLMs focus visually while generating responses is crucial for transparency, diagnosing issues like hallucination and bias.

Method: GLIMPSE combines gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to produce attribution heat maps.

Result: The framework provides fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal reasoning, revealing human-attention misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Conclusion: GLIMPSE advances interpretability in LVLMs, offering a tool for analyzing and improving model behavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

*Yuan Yao, Yicong Hong, Difan Liu, Long Mai, Feng Liu, Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2MD, a method to distill diffusion transformers (DiT) into the Mamba model, reducing computational costs while maintaining image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of self-attention in DiT for high-resolution image generation motivate the search for efficient alternatives like Mamba.

Method: T2MD uses layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation to transition from DiT to Mamba, enabling efficient training and global dependencies.

Result: The method achieves high-quality text-to-image generation at resolutions up to 2048x2048 with low overhead.

Conclusion: T2MD demonstrates the feasibility of using Mamba for non-causal visual tasks, opening avenues for future research.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

*Jinlong Li, Dong Zhao, Qi Zang, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma, Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OoPk, a novel CTTA method for semantic segmentation, using orthogonal projection and online prior-knowledge aggregation to balance performance and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation in CTTA, especially in complex tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Uses orthogonal projection to preserve source knowledge and an aggressive image masking strategy for efficient adaptation.

Result: Outperforms previous CTTA methods in semantic segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OoPk effectively balances adaptation and performance, reducing forgetting and error accumulation.

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale pretrained OMR models capable of handling full-page/multi-page scores and generating human-readable ABC notation.

Method: Combines a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder, trained on 214K+ images, to generalize across typeset scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets, validated by comprehensive metrics.

Conclusion: Legato sets a new benchmark for end-to-end OMR, demonstrating strong generalization and performance.

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music
recognition (OMR). Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable
of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

*Yimu Wang, Mozhgan Nasr Azadani, Sean Sedwards, Krzysztof Czarnecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAWAII is a framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving VLMs' visual understanding without high computational overhead.

Method: Uses teacher-specific LoRA adapters with a router for conflict-free knowledge distillation, combining fine-grained (token importance) and coarse-grained (general-knowledge) distillation.

Result: Outperforms popular open-source VLMs in various vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: HAWAII effectively balances performance and efficiency for VLMs.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Vision Language Models (VLMs) infer emotions, focusing on visual cues like teeth and facial attributes, revealing consistency but also risks like bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the psychological grounding of visual cues used by VLMs in emotion recognition and identify potential risks in sensitive domains.

Method: Benchmarking VLMs on a teeth-annotated subset of AffectNet and introspecting GPT-4o's reasoning.

Result: VLMs rely on cues like visible teeth and eyebrow position, showing internal consistency but also risks of shortcut learning and bias.

Conclusion: While VLMs exhibit emergent affective reasoning, their reliance on superficial cues raises fairness and bias concerns in critical applications.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

TL;DR: RareSpot is a detection framework for small, rare wildlife in aerial imagery, combining multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation to improve accuracy by 35% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of elusive species like prairie dogs is vital for conservation but challenging due to their small size and sparse distribution.

Method: Integrates multi-scale consistency learning for feature alignment and context-aware augmentation to synthesize difficult training samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by 35% and generalizes well across wildlife datasets.

Conclusion: RareSpot advances ecological monitoring and sets a foundation for detecting small, rare species in aerial scenes.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

TL;DR: A novel framework enhances image inversion using consistency models for high-quality editing in just four steps, outperforming full-step diffusion models in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for image editing are computationally intensive, and distilled models suffer from poor inversion quality, limiting editing capabilities.

Method: Proposes a cycle-consistency optimization strategy to improve inversion and reconstruction, balancing editability and content preservation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in image editing tasks, matching or surpassing full-step diffusion models with greater efficiency.

Conclusion: The method enables high-fidelity inversion and editing in fewer steps, with code available for public use.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

TL;DR: PrITTI introduces a latent diffusion-based framework using 3D primitives for scalable, editable 3D scene generation, outperforming voxel-based methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel-based 3D scene generation is memory-heavy and inflexible. Primitives offer a compact, editable alternative.

Method: Hybrid representation: rasterized ground surfaces and vectorized 3D primitives. Uses Cholesky-based parameterization for stable encoding.

Result: Outperforms voxel-based methods on KITTI-360, reducing memory by 3×. Enables instance-level manipulation and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: PrITTI demonstrates efficient, high-quality 3D scene generation with primitives, supporting flexible editing and applications.

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

TL;DR: A novel framework using Vision Transformer (ViT) reconstructs cloud-covered MSI data by combining time-series MSI and SAR, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover in MSI disrupts early crop mapping, while SAR lacks spectral detail. Combining both addresses these limitations.

Method: Proposes Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using ViT, leveraging temporal coherence of MSI and SAR's complementary data via attention.

Result: Outperforms baselines using non-time-series MSI/SAR or time-series MSI alone, improving reconstruction in cloud-covered areas.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances MSI reconstruction by integrating time-series MSI and SAR data.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

TL;DR: A lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm using MobileViT is proposed, achieving efficient performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of single-modality tracking in challenging conditions by leveraging multimodal data, while reducing computational expense.

Method: Progressive fusion framework with separable attention for intra-modal and inter-modal interactions in RGB-T tracking.

Result: Comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art with <4M parameters and 122 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: First MobileViT-based RGB-T tracker, offering efficient and accurate performance.

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: xarrayvideo is a Python library for compressing large-scale Earth system datasets by encoding them as videos, achieving high compression ratios (up to 250x) while maintaining fidelity. It leverages standard video codecs and demonstrates effectiveness on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling rapidly growing Earth observation datasets by exploiting their inherent redundancies, similar to videos, for efficient compression.

Method: Uses established video compression techniques via ffmpeg to encode multichannel spatiotemporal datasets as videos.

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to 250x with high fidelity (PSNRs ranging from 40.60 to 65.91 dB) and redistributes datasets at significantly reduced sizes without quality loss.

Conclusion: xarrayvideo provides an efficient, accessible solution for compressing Earth observation datasets, making advanced techniques practical for the Earth science community.

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

*Mert Can Cakmak, Nitin Agarwal, Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a lightweight, perceptually-aligned framework for keyframe extraction in videos, designed for detecting standout moments without deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online videos amplify cyber social threats like misinformation and radicalization, necessitating tools for detecting impactful moments for moderation and analysis.

Method: PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space, using perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames aligned with human visual sensitivity. It is interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient.

Result: PRISM achieves strong accuracy and fidelity on benchmark datasets (BBC, TVSum, SumMe, ClipShots) while maintaining high compression ratios.

Conclusion: PRISM is effective for structured and unstructured video content, offering a scalable tool for moderating harmful or politically sensitive media.

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

### [93] [Semantic Scene Graph for Ultrasound Image Explanation and Scanning Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19683)
*Xuesong Li, Dianye Huang, Yameng Zhang, Nassir Navab, Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scene graph (SG) method for ultrasound images to improve interpretability and scanning guidance for non-experts, validated on neck region images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of medical ultrasound interpretability and the unmet need for basic scanning guidance for non-expert users, especially in point-of-care settings.

Method: Uses a transformer-based one-stage method to compute ultrasound SGs, refined by LLMs for user queries, and explores SGs for scanning guidance.

Result: Validated on neck region images, showing potential to democratize ultrasound by enhancing interpretability and usability for non-experts.

Conclusion: The SG-based approach effectively improves ultrasound interpretability and scanning guidance for non-expert users.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

*Jialu Pi, Juan Maria Farina, Rimita Lahiri, Jiwoong Jeong, Archana Gurudu, Hyung-Bok Park, Chieh-Ju Chao, Chadi Ayoub, Reza Arsanjani, Imon Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSCARD, a multimodal predictive model integrating CXR and ECG, outperforms single-modality methods in MACE risk assessment, offering cost-effective screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MACE is a leading global cause of mortality, and current screening methods are limited by bias and single-modality constraints.

Method: MOSCARD combines CXR and ECG using multimodal alignment, causal reasoning, and a dual back-propagation graph to mitigate bias.

Result: The model achieved AUCs of 0.75, 0.83, and 0.71 on internal, ED shift, and MIMIC datasets, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOSCARD enables early, cost-effective MACE risk screening, improving patient outcomes and reducing disparities.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack generalization across species and environments due to limited taxonomic coverage and rigid architectures.

Method: OW uses language-aware embeddings and Grounding-DINO, trained on 15 datasets, with an efficient search algorithm for species detection.

Result: OW achieves 0.981 mAP50 with fine-tuning and 0.597 mAP50 on novel species, capturing 95% of species while exploring only 33% of images.

Conclusion: OW is a flexible, cost-effective solution for biodiversity assessments, with publicly released code and dataset splits for reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Result: Highlights methodological overlaps, unique challenges, and recent advancements in the field.

Conclusion: Provides a structured review to support future advancements in ancient script recognition and decipherment.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

*Sunggu Kyung, Hyungbin Park, Jinyoung Seo, Jimin Sung, Jihyun Kim, Dongyeong Kim, Wooyoung Jo, Yoojin Nam, Sangah Park, Taehee Kwon, Sang Min Lee, Namkug Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedErr-CT is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in identifying and correcting errors in CT reports, aiming to improve clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for CT examinations and diagnostic errors necessitate rigorous validation of MLLMs, which current benchmarks lack.

Method: Introduces MedErr-CT, a VQA framework with six error categories and three task levels (classification, detection, correction) to assess MLLMs.

Result: Quantitative evaluation reveals significant variation in MLLMs' performance across error types.

Conclusion: MedErr-CT aids in developing reliable MLLMs to reduce diagnostic errors and enhance clinical accuracy.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

*Minghao Qin, Xiangrui Liu, Zhengyang Liang, Yan Shu, Huaying Yuan, Juenjie Zhou, Shitao Xiao, Bo Zhao, Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-XL-2 is a novel MLLM for long-video understanding, using task-aware KV sparsification to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long video inputs due to high computational and memory costs, limiting performance and efficiency.

Method: Proposes chunk-based pre-filling (dividing visual tokens into chunks with sparse attention) and bi-level key-value decoding (selective reloading of key-values).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, processing 10,000+ frames efficiently on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: Video-XL-2 addresses long-video challenges effectively, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

*Yinan Xia, Yilei Jiang, Yingshui Tan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Xiangyu Yue, Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSR-Align, a dataset for improving safety alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against harmful multimodal prompts, enhancing robustness without compromising reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods for unimodal models are inadequate for VLMs, and current datasets lack fine-grained reasoning for multimodal threats.

Method: Developed MSR-Align, a dataset with fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning across vision and text, using a pipeline emphasizing diversity and quality filtering.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align improves robustness against jailbreak attacks and maintains or enhances general reasoning.

Conclusion: MSR-Align offers a scalable solution for safety alignment in reasoning-capable VLMs, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our
dataset is made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Automated Image Recognition (AIR) framework using generative AI to create pre-annotated datasets and train models, eliminating manual labeling. Includes AIR-Gen for dataset synthesis and AIR-Aug for dataset enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in data gathering and annotation for deep learning, especially for novel or sensitive subjects lacking datasets.

Method: Introduces AIR-Gen for tailored dataset generation with prompt engineering and distribution adjustment, and AIR-Aug for dataset enhancement.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy in training models and achieves a 4.4/5.0 user satisfaction score.

Conclusion: AIR framework effectively reduces manual effort in dataset creation and improves model performance, with positive community reception.

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

*Rui Huang, Jincheng Zeng, Sen Gao, Yan Xing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) to improve long-range dependency capture in remote sensing change detection, along with two supporting modules (SIM and MBFEM), achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based approaches fail to effectively capture long-range dependencies between image channels, limiting feature representation.

Method: Introduces 3D-SSM for global spatial and channel information capture, complemented by SIM for bi-temporal feature integration and MBFEM for multi-domain feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D-SSM and supporting modules enhance change detection by improving feature representation and integration.

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

*Mohamed Moustafa, Joseph Lemley, Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event cameras enable low-latency, high-dynamic-range recording. A CNN model extracts cardiac pulse signals from facial event streams, achieving competitive heart rate accuracy compared to standard cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of event cameras for remote heart rate monitoring by leveraging their high temporal resolution and dynamic range.

Method: A supervised CNN model processes 2D event stream representations to reconstruct cardiac pulse signals, evaluated via heart rate accuracy (RMSE).

Result: Event-based models (60/120 FPS) outperformed standard cameras (30 FPS), with RMSEs of 2.54/2.13 bpm vs. 2.92 bpm. The baseline event model achieved 3.32 bpm.

Conclusion: Event cameras effectively preserve cardiac signals in facial recordings, demonstrating promise for non-contact heart rate monitoring.

Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at
extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a
stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within
the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal
resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free
reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event
recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)
model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a
two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance
evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental
results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is
effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this
novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event
frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm)
compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on
standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated
at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an
RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.

*Weichen Zhang, Dong Xu, Wanli Ouyang, Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAN and SPCAN, unsupervised domain adaptation methods combining collaborative and adversarial learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain distribution mismatch in unsupervised domain adaptation by learning domain-specific and domain-invariant features.

Method: Uses collaborative learning for domain-specific features and adversarial learning for domain-invariant features, with a self-paced learning strategy (SPCAN) for target domain discriminability.

Result: Achieves top performance on benchmark datasets for object and video action recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively bridge domain gaps in unsupervised adaptation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial

TL;DR: WaterCaption is the first captioning dataset for waterway environments, paired with Da Yu, an efficient multi-modal model for global semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing waterway perception models lack global semantic understanding, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured logs.

Method: Introduces WaterCaption dataset and Da Yu model with Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA) for efficient vision-to-language projection.

Result: Da Yu outperforms state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and other benchmarks, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: WaterCaption and Da Yu advance waterway environment perception, enabling better semantic understanding and deployment on USVs.

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods like 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRFs face high training overhead for long captures. HoliGS aims to address this by accurately reconstructing large-scale, dynamic environments.

Method: Decomposes scenes into static backgrounds and time-varying objects using Gaussian primitives with global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and non-rigid deformations via invertible neural flow.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality and reduces training/rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs.

Conclusion: HoliGS offers a practical, scalable solution for embodied view synthesis in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

*Kai Zhao, Wubang Yuan, Zheng Wang, Guanyi Li, Xiaoqiang Zhu, Deng-ping Fan, Dan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VLM-guided cascaded framework for Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS), addressing domain gaps and segmentation challenges by leveraging SAM and VLM-derived features for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing two-stage methods in OVCOS, which suffer from domain gaps and ineffective segmentation for camouflaged objects.

Method: Proposes a VLM-guided cascaded framework using SAM for segmentation with VLM-derived prompts and a soft spatial prior for classification to retain full image context.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on OVCOS and conventional benchmarks, showing improved localization and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification, addressing key challenges in OVCOS.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

*Jean-Paul Ainam, Rahul, Lora Cavuoto, Matthew Hackett, Jack Norfleet, Suvranu De*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning system uses human gaze data and video recordings to objectively assess endotracheal intubation skills, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective evaluation of airway management skills often fails to measure real-world competency, necessitating an objective, data-driven approach.

Method: The system combines gaze data and video recordings, using visual masks and an autoencoder network with an attention mechanism to classify ETI procedures.

Result: The method improves prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness, outperforming traditional assessment techniques.

Conclusion: This approach offers a robust, objective tool for clinical skill assessment, with potential benefits for training and patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

*Junsei Tokumitsu, Yuiga Wada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LM-AD for affordance detection in 3D point clouds, introducing AQM for fine-grained alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained alignments between point clouds and text due to reliance on simple cosine similarity.

Method: LM-AD with Affordance Query Module (AQM) leverages a pretrained language model for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on 3D AffordanceNet.

Conclusion: LM-AD with AQM effectively addresses fine-grained affordance detection challenges in 3D point clouds.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

*Weichen Zhang, Dong Xu, Jing Zhang, Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PMC, a multi-modality domain adaptation framework, and PMC-PI for missing modalities, showing effectiveness in cross-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transfer knowledge from source to target domains using multiple modalities, addressing challenges like missing modalities in target domains.

Method: PMC leverages modality cooperation for reliable pseudo-labeling; PMC-PI uses MMG to generate missing modalities via adversarial learning and semantics preservation.

Result: Validated on 11 datasets, PMC and PMC-PI outperform in multi-modality cross-domain tasks under MMDA and MMDA-PI settings.

Conclusion: PMC and PMC-PI effectively address multi-modality domain adaptation, demonstrating robustness in handling missing modalities and cross-domain recognition.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

*Yuang Yao, Ruiqi Wu, Yi Zhou, Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetCoP is a continual vision-language pre-training framework for integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities, addressing catastrophic forgetting with rehearsal and distillation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models ignore modality complementarity, and existing foundation models remain modality-specific. Dynamic environments require incremental integration of multimodal data.

Method: RetCoP uses rehearsal with representative image-text pairs and off-diagonal information distillation to mitigate forgetting and preserve alignment.

Result: RetCoP outperforms compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting rate.

Conclusion: RetCoP successfully integrates multimodal fundus data incrementally, offering a robust solution for continual pre-training.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal survival prediction framework using hypergraph learning to integrate pathology slides and genomics data, addressing modality imbalance and incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on FFPE slides and neglect FF slides, suffer from modality imbalance, and require complete data, limiting clinical use.

Method: Proposes a hypergraph learning framework with a memory mechanism to handle incomplete modalities and balance pathology-genomic fusion.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods by 2.3% in C-Index; surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models (7.9%) in incomplete scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multimodal data, addresses imbalance, and improves survival prediction, especially with incomplete data.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

Result: The approach outperforms in open-vocabulary part-level segmentation and generalizes well across datasets.

Conclusion: The work advances 3D scene understanding by enabling part-level segmentation with scalable data and a robust framework.

Abstract: This paper aims to achieve the segmentation of any 3D part in a scene based
on natural language descriptions, extending beyond traditional object-level 3D
scene understanding and addressing both data and methodological challenges. Due
to the expensive acquisition and annotation burden, existing datasets and
methods are predominantly limited to object-level comprehension. To overcome

through an innovative and cost-effective method for constructing synthetic 3D

Motivation: To address the limitations of edge-based segmentation methods, particularly for noisy images or those with weak boundaries, by leveraging regional intensity differences.

Method: The model is derived from the Mumford-Shah framework, using level set formulation, divergence theorem, and curve evolution theory. It is implemented in Python with finite difference methods, focusing on numerical stability.

Result: The algorithm shows accurate segmentation, robustness to noise, and outperforms classical edge-based methods in experiments on medical and synthetic images.

Conclusion: The Chan-Vese model is highly suitable for complex segmentation tasks and has strong potential for real-world imaging applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results
on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness
to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionEcho is a training-free test-time distillation framework for video generation models, improving motion customization and fidelity by leveraging teacher models to guide student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distilled video generation models lack motion customization under training-free settings, as existing methods fail to adapt to their accelerated generative process.

Method: MotionEcho uses diffusion teacher forcing, endpoint prediction, and interpolation to guide student models, dynamically allocating computation for efficiency.

Result: The method significantly enhances motion fidelity and generation quality while maintaining efficiency, validated across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: MotionEcho effectively addresses motion customization challenges in distilled video generation models without additional training.

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for tissue deformation recovery from stereo endoscopic images improves surgical navigation by modeling geometry and deformation with 3D point and derivative maps, avoiding camera pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like camera motion, occlusion, and lack of biomechanical priors in tissue deformation analysis for surgical applications.

Method: Models tissue geometry as 3D point and derivative maps and deformation as 3D displacement and local deformation maps, optimizing inter-frame alignment without camera pose estimation.

Result: Achieves 0.37±0.27 mm and 0.39±0.21 mm 3D reconstruction accuracy in non-occluded and occluded areas, respectively, and estimates surface strain distribution.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers tissue deformation and geometry, even under occlusion, enhancing surgical navigation and mechanical analysis.

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

TL;DR: Mem4Nav introduces a hierarchical spatial-cognition memory system for VLN, improving performance on urban navigation tasks by 7-13 pp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of modular pipelines (lack of unified memory) and end-to-end agents (fixed context windows, implicit spatial reasoning) in VLN tasks.

Method: Combines sparse octree for fine-grained indexing and semantic topology graph for landmark connectivity, using trainable memory tokens in a reversible Transformer. Includes long-term (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) modules for historical and real-time processing.

Result: Achieves 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement across three backbones.

Conclusion: Mem4Nav's hierarchical map and dual memory modules are essential for enhancing VLN performance, with open-sourced implementation.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text readability in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emerges abruptly after extensive training, unlike gradual semantic understanding. This suggests contrastive learning prioritizes general semantics first, with text-specific skills developing later. Tailored training strategies are needed for faster text comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how text recognition in images develops during VLM training and identify the differences in learning patterns between semantic understanding and text readability.

Method: Analyzed the emergence of text readability and semantic understanding in VLMs during training, comparing their development timelines.

Result: Text readability emerges abruptly after many iterations, while semantic understanding develops gradually. Matching images with rendered text is even slower, indicating deeper semantic integration needs.

Conclusion: Tailored training strategies are necessary to accelerate robust text comprehension in VLMs, providing insights for optimizing multimodal learning.

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD), a lightweight AI model for high-resolution climate data generation, reducing computational demands while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional downscaling methods are computationally intensive, and existing AI models, though effective, remain resource-heavy. HDD aims to address this by offering a more efficient solution.

Method: HDD uses a hierarchical sampling process within a diffusion framework, implementing a coarse-to-fine hierarchy via downsampling. It reduces computational load by processing fewer pixels.

Result: HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 and CMIP6 datasets, with significant computational savings. It also transfers well across different resolutions.

Conclusion: HDD provides a computationally efficient and scalable solution for probabilistic climate downscaling, enabling affordable high-resolution climate projections.

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based method for CT report generation uses recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions to improve alignment between CT slices and text, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CT report generation fail to account for slice transformations and multi-level features, especially organ lesions, limiting report quality.

Method: Proposes a vision Transformer for recurrent slice processing and stereo attentions to hierarchically model features and align them with text for LLM-based report generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the M3D-Cap dataset, surpassing strong baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates multi-level CT features and aligns them with text, demonstrating superior performance in CT report generation.

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

TL;DR: GLCANet is a lightweight segmentation framework for UHR remote sensing imagery, combining global and local features efficiently with minimal GPU usage, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation in UHR remote sensing imagery, addressing challenges in computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion.

Method: GLCANet uses a dual-stream architecture with self-attention for long-range dependencies and masked cross-attention for adaptive global-local feature fusion.

Result: GLCANet achieves higher accuracy and computational efficiency than state-of-the-art methods, handling large images with minimal memory usage.

Conclusion: GLCANet offers a practical solution for real-world remote sensing applications by balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

*Yin Zhang, Zian Ning, Xiaoyu Zhang, Shiliang Guo, Peidong Liu, Shiyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for detecting micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) using event cameras by focusing on propeller features in event streams, outperforming RGB-based methods without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAV detection methods rely on RGB images, which lack generalized detection due to diverse appearances. Event cameras capture propeller features better.

Method: The method uses three modules to extract propeller features from event streams while filtering noise. A new event-based MAV dataset is introduced.

Result: The method achieves 83.0% precision (+30.3%) and 81.5% recall (+36.4%) on the new dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Event-based MAV detection is effective, and the introduced dataset supports future research in this area.

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMF-MedIT is a framework for integrating medical image and tabular data, addressing cross-modal discrepancies and noise with adaptive modulation and a novel tabular encoder, FT-Mamba.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in multimodal medical analysis include cross-modal discrepancies, noise in tabular data, and data scarcity.

Method: Proposes AMF module for adaptive modulation and fusion, and FT-Mamba for efficient tabular data encoding. Introduces feature masks, density, and leakage losses.

Result: AMF-MedIT achieves superior performance and data efficiency, with strong adaptability to incomplete data. FT-Mamba excels in feature extraction and guiding image attention.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multimodal medical data, balancing performance and efficiency, while offering interpretability insights.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

### [126] [Sampling Matters in Explanations: Towards Trustworthy Attribution Analysis Building Block in Visual Models through Maximizing Explanation Certainty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19442)
*Róisín Luo, James McDermott, Colm O'Riordan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the misalignment of sample distributions in gradient integration for image attribution analysis, proposing a semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features to improve explanation certainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods add noise to images for gradient integration, leading to low explanation certainty due to distribution misalignment. The paper aims to solve this by aligning sample distributions with natural image distributions.

Method: A semi-optimal sampling approach is introduced, suppressing features from inputs to create samples with distributions similar to natural images, avoiding noise-induced misalignment.

Result: Extensive evaluation on ImageNet shows the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding more satisfactory explanations across all tested models.

Conclusion: The proposed feature suppression approach effectively aligns sample distributions, enhancing the trustworthiness of attribution analysis in visual models.

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the
amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with
varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art
(SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleCap is an inference-time scalable image captioning strategy that generates detailed captions by addressing biases in LVLMs through heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle biases in LVLMs (multimodal and linguistic) that lead to imbalanced or hallucinated captions, hindering high-quality image captioning.

Method: Proposes two components: heuristic question answering to inject relevant information progressively, and contrastive sentence rating to eliminate hallucinations.

Result: ScaleCap improves caption accuracy and balance, validated by extensive experiments and performance gains on 11 benchmarks. It also enhances caption richness and fidelity in additional tasks.

Conclusion: ScaleCap effectively addresses LVLM biases, producing more accurate and informative captions, and demonstrates practical benefits in downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-step method to improve synthetic data for training deep learning models, reducing the performance gap with real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real image datasets are hard to curate and pose privacy/legal issues, limiting commercial use. Synthetic data often underperforms.

Method: 1. Improved neural fractal formulation for synthetic data. 2. Reverse stylization to transfer features from real images to synthetic datasets.

Result: Significantly lower distributional gap (measured by KID), 11% FID reduction in image generation, 20% autoencoder error decrease, and 10% ImageNet-100 accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The method enables practical model training when large real datasets are unavailable, showing promise for commercial applications.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Surgery-R1, a Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Model for Surgical-VQLA, addressing the lack of deep reasoning and interpretability in existing models. It uses a two-stage fine-tuning mechanism and a new dataset, Surgery-R1-54k, achieving superior performance.

Motivation: Existing Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning and interpretability, limiting their clinical reliability and development potential.

Method: Proposes Surgery-R1, a Reasoning MLLM, with a two-stage fine-tuning mechanism (SFT and RFT) and a Multimodal Coherence reward system. Uses the Surgery-R1-54k dataset for training.

Result: Surgery-R1 outperforms SOTA models and MLLMs in Surgical-VQLA, demonstrating strong reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances reasoning and interpretability in Surgical-VQLA, with potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and
dataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater salient instance segmentation (USIS) is underexplored due to the dynamic nature of underwater environments and the scarcity of annotated datasets. The paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive dataset.

Method: The authors introduce USIS16K, a dataset of 16,151 high-resolution underwater images with instance-level annotations, covering 158 categories. Benchmark evaluations for object detection and USIS tasks are also provided.

Result: USIS16K offers diversity, complexity, and scalability, significantly advancing research in underwater object detection and segmentation.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark models are publicly released to support future research in underwater salient instance segmentation.

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and
benchmark models are publicly available.

TL;DR: HMSViT, a Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer, improves corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis with efficient multi-scale feature extraction and reduced reliance on labeled data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is crucial, but current automated methods using Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) face challenges like inefficient feature extraction and data limitations.

Method: HMSViT combines pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding for multi-scale feature extraction. It uses block-masked self-supervised learning to reduce dependency on labeled data and a multi-scale decoder for segmentation and classification.

Result: HMSViT achieves 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming models like Swin Transformer and HiViT by up to 6.39% with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: HMSViT provides robust, clinically viable results, making it suitable for scalable real-world diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

TL;DR: SceneCrafter is a 3D-consistent editor for realistic manipulation of driving scenes, addressing challenges in cross-camera consistency, empty street priors, and paired image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely synthetic scenes lack grounding in reality, while existing editing models face challenges in 3D consistency and data generation for driving simulations.

Method: Leverages multi-view diffusion models for controllable editing, introduces a framework for paired data generation, and uses alpha-blending for local edits with empty street priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and scene editing quality.

Conclusion: SceneCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in driving scene simulation, offering superior editing capabilities.

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), introduces the PRE-HAL dataset for evaluating perception and reasoning, and proposes a DST-based detection method to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucinations in LVLMs pose risks in safety-critical AI applications, but existing benchmarks overlook reasoning-related hallucinations.

Method: Developed the PRE-HAL dataset for comprehensive evaluation and proposed a DST-based detection method using uncertainty estimation to identify conflicts in high-level features.

Result: The method outperformed baselines, improving AUROC by 4-10% across tested LVLMs.

Conclusion: The PRE-HAL benchmark and DST-based method effectively address visual hallucinations, enhancing LVLM reliability.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (ReMAR-DS) reduces metal artifacts in kVCT and transforms images to MVCT-like quality, improving radiotherapy planning and reducing patient radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in kVCT degrade image quality, affecting clinical decisions. The goal is to reduce artifacts and bridge the gap between kVCT and MVCT for better radiotherapy planning.

Method: Uses an encoder-decoder architecture with feature recalibration to focus on artifact regions and preserve anatomical structures, transforming kVCT to MVCT-like images.

Result: Produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, reducing the need for repeated MVCT scans.

Conclusion: ReMAR-DS enhances radiotherapy planning by improving kVCT quality, reducing radiation exposure for patients, and eliminating reliance on repeated MVCT scans.

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

TL;DR: A method to detect and identify natural-looking backdoor triggers in face recognition systems, achieving 74% top-5 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in face recognition systems pose security threats, especially with natural triggers like sunglasses or hats.

Method: Proposes a technique to detect compromised networks and identify natural, physically realizable triggers.

Result: Achieves 74% top-5 accuracy in trigger identification, outperforming a naive baseline (56%).

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses backdoor threats in face recognition systems, enhancing security.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

*Jakob Ambsdorf, Asbjørn Munk, Sebastian Llambias, Anders Nymark Christensen, Kamil Mikolaj, Randall Balestriero, Martin Tolsgaard, Aasa Feragen, Mads Nielsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether to pretrain custom foundation models on medical data or use transfer-learning from generalist models, using a fetal ultrasound dataset. It finds custom pretraining with established methods like DINOv2 yields superior results without needing novel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the effectiveness of custom pretraining versus transfer-learning for medical data, specifically fetal ultrasound, and assess if novel methods are necessary.

Method: A case-study using the DINOv2 method to pretrain a foundation model on 2M fetal ultrasound images, comparing it against models pretrained on natural images and supervised baselines.

Result: Custom pretraining outperforms transfer-learning, even with smaller datasets, and established computer vision methods work well without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Custom foundation models for medical domains are feasible with existing methods, avoiding unnecessary methodological innovation under resource constraints.

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

### [138] [MambaOutRS: A Hybrid CNN-Fourier Architecture for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19561)
*Minjong Cheon, Changbae Mun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaOutRS, a hybrid convolutional architecture, outperforms SSMs and transformers in remote sensing image classification by combining gated CNNs and a Fourier Filter Gate for global context, achieving SOTA results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of adapting State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba to 2D visual data, the paper proposes a simpler, more effective hybrid architecture.

Method: MambaOutRS uses stacked Gated CNN blocks for local features and a Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) for global context in a four-stage hierarchical design, evaluated on remote sensing datasets.

Result: MambaOutRS achieved SOTA performance, with its variant (24.0M parameters) scoring 98.41% F1 on UC Merced and 95.99% on AID, outperforming larger models.

Conclusion: The study shows that gated convolutions and frequency-based gates can replace complex SSMs, offering an efficient paradigm for vision tasks, especially in remote sensing.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

*Gencer Sumbul, Chang Xu, Emanuele Dalsasso, Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARTIES is a foundation model for multi-sensor remote sensing, enabling flexible data processing across diverse sensors without architectural changes or re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models are limited to single sensors or fixed combinations, hindering scalability and generalization in remote sensing.

Method: SMARTIES projects data from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space and uses a unified transformer model with cross-sensor token mixup for reconstruction.

Result: SMARTIES outperforms sensor-specific models in single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors.

Conclusion: SMARTIES provides a scalable and generalizable solution for multi-sensor remote sensing, lifting sensor-specific limitations.

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

Result: Achieves best performance on the KITTI-360 dataset for both LiDAR and Camera domains.

Conclusion: NVSF is a robust, self-supervised solution for dynamic scene representation in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR
and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing
both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline
models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera
domain. Code of the model is available at

of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,

TL;DR: HOIverse is a synthetic dataset for scene understanding, focusing on human-object interactions and scene graphs, with rich annotations and benchmarking on state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks reliable datasets for scene understanding in indoor environments involving humans, necessitating a structured representation like scene graphs.

Method: HOIverse provides RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images, and human keypoints, with parametric relations between humans and objects.

Result: The dataset offers accurate and dense relationship ground truths, enabling benchmarking of scene graph generation models.

Conclusion: HOIverse aims to advance research in scene understanding involving humans by providing a comprehensive synthetic dataset.

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field

*Letian Kang, Shixian Luo, Yiqiang Li, Xiaoyang Yu, Shenxuan Zhou, Yong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEVLM is a parallel encoding strategy for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that reduces attention computation complexity while maintaining accuracy, improving efficiency for long video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention mechanisms in VLMs have quadratic complexity, limiting their application to long video understanding. PEVLM aims to address this inefficiency without requiring model finetuning.

Method: PEVLM partitions input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions, reducing computation from O((T×N)²) to O(T×N).

Result: PEVLM achieves up to 8.37% accuracy improvement, 7.47x speedup in attention computation, and 40% reduction in end-to-end latency, outperforming baselines under strict latency constraints.

Conclusion: PEVLM is effective for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it suitable for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

*Yang Xing, Jiong Wu, Yuheng Bu, Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2-SGP improves medical image segmentation by automating prompts and addressing domain shift with pseudo-mask generation and attention modules, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's reliance on manual prompts and domain shift from natural to medical images limits its effectiveness in medical segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposed SAM2-SGP with Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) and Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) modules, plus low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for domain shift.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art models (nnUNet, SwinUNet) and foundation models (SAM2, MedSAM2) across multiple medical imaging modalities.

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP effectively automates prompts and mitigates domain shift, enhancing medical image segmentation performance.

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision oncology needs cost-effective, rapid molecular insights, but current deep learning struggles with WSI-based predictions.

Method: Uses transcriptomic privileged information to train genome-anchored histological embeddings for molecular prediction from WSIs.

Result: Superior performance in 49 tasks (AUC ≥ 0.80 in 14 tasks, C-index ≥ 0.70 in survival cohorts), revealing morphological-genomic links.

Conclusion: PathLUPI bridges molecular insights with routine pathology, overcoming limitations of existing models for clinical use.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

*Yue Zhou, Yuan Bi, Wenjuan Tong, Wei Wang, Nassir Navab, Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraAD, a vision-language model, improves anomaly detection in ultrasound images by combining few-shot learning with text embeddings for better localization and fine-grained classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection methods lack fine-grained differentiation (e.g., benign vs. malignant tumors) and struggle with domain gaps in ultrasound imaging due to device and parameter variations.

Method: UltraAD fuses image-level tokens with text embeddings for localization and uses a memory bank of few-shot samples with text descriptions for fine-grained classification. Image features are adapted while text embeddings remain frozen.

Result: UltraAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three breast ultrasound datasets in lesion localization and fine-grained classification.

Conclusion: UltraAD addresses key challenges in medical anomaly detection, offering improved accuracy and generalization for clinical applications.

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

*Stephanie Käs, Sven Peter, Henrik Thillmann, Anton Burenko, David Benjamin Adrian, Dennis Mack, Timm Linder, Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates projection methods for 3D human pose estimation in fisheye images, finding advanced models like the double sphere model improve accuracy. A heuristic for model selection is proposed, and a novel dataset (FISHnCHIPS) is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate human pose detection in fisheye images is challenging due to distortions, and existing methods lack systematic evaluation for wide-FOV poses.

Method: Evaluates pinhole, equidistant, double sphere models, and cylindrical projections for 3D human pose estimation in fisheye images.

Result: Pinhole projection is inadequate for close-ups; optimal method varies with FOV. Advanced models like double sphere enhance accuracy.

Conclusion: Proposes a heuristic for projection model selection and introduces the FISHnCHIPS dataset to address gaps in fisheye-based pose estimation.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo4D is a framework for generating detailed, multi-view consistent 4D scenes from text prompts (optionally with images), dividing the task into dynamic foreground and evolving background synthesis guided by a reference motion sequence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D synthesis methods lack multi-view consistency and immersion in dynamic scenes, limiting their practical application.

Method: CoCo4D uses video diffusion models to generate an initial motion sequence, then employs progressive outpainting for foreground and background synthesis, optimizing a parametric trajectory for seamless blending.

Result: CoCo4D outperforms existing methods in 4D scene generation, producing realistic and coherent dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current 4D synthesis methods, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFM is a simple framework for progressive visual generation, improving quality and efficiency over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional visual generation is computationally intensive, and existing multi-stage approaches add complexity. DFM aims to simplify this.

Method: DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a multi-scale representation (e.g., Laplacian pyramid).

Result: DFM improves visual quality for images/videos, with 35.2% better FDD scores on Imagenet-1k 512px and faster convergence for large models.

Conclusion: DFM offers superior performance with simplicity, minimal modifications, and a single model.

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

*Yitao Peng, Lianghua He, Die Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoSolo is a deep neural architecture for interpretable image classification using a single prototype, reducing cognitive complexity and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype networks rely on multiple prototypes for classification and interpretation, which complicates explanations. ProtoSolo simplifies this by using a single prototype.

Method: ProtoSolo activates a single prototype for classification, uses feature maps for similarity comparison, and employs a non-prototype projection learning strategy.

Result: ProtoSolo achieves superior performance on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets, with lower cognitive complexity in explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoSolo simplifies interpretable classification with single-prototype activation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in performance and explainability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

*Xingyang Li, Muyang Li, Tianle Cai, Haocheng Xi, Shuo Yang, Yujun Lin, Lvmin Zhang, Songlin Yang, Jinbo Hu, Kelly Peng, Maneesh Agrawala, Ion Stoica, Kurt Keutzer, Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism for video diffusion models, reducing computational costs while maintaining video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of video diffusion models due to the temporal dimension, and the observed Spatiotemporal Energy Decay phenomenon, inspired the development of a more efficient attention mechanism.

Method: Proposes Radial Attention, which uses a static attention mask with exponentially decaying compute density, reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n).

Result: Radial Attention achieves up to 1.9× speedup, reduces training costs by 4.4×, and enables 4× longer video generation with minimal tuning.

Conclusion: Radial Attention is a highly efficient and scalable solution for video diffusion models, significantly improving performance and reducing costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

*Yubo Huang, Weiqiang Wang, Sirui Zhao, Tong Xu, Lin Liu, Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bind-Your-Avatar, a model for generating multi-talking-character videos in the same scene, addressing audio-to-character correspondence and dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single-character scenarios, leaving multi-character conversations in shared environments unaddressed.

Method: Proposes an MM-DiT-based model with an Embedding Router for audio-character binding, 3D-mask embedding router techniques, and a new dataset.

Result: Superior performance in dual-talking-character video generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Bind-Your-Avatar effectively tackles multi-character video generation challenges, offering fine-grained control and a benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

### [154] [SimpleGVR: A Simple Baseline for Latent-Cascaded Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19838)
*Liangbin Xie, Yu Li, Shian Du, Menghan Xia, Xintao Wang, Fanghua Yu, Ziyan Chen, Pengfei Wan, Jiantao Zhou, Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage video generation framework combining semantic content generation and detail synthesis, focusing on optimizing cascaded VSR models for high-resolution output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User demand for higher-resolution video outputs makes latent computation alone insufficient, necessitating a decoupled approach for efficiency and quality.

Method: The study introduces degradation strategies for training pair generation, analyzes VSR model behavior, and proposes architectural innovations like interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies validating each design choice's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work establishes a practical baseline for cascaded VSR generation, providing insights for future efficient synthesis systems.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

### [155] [GenHSI: Controllable Generation of Human-Scene Interaction Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19840)
*Zekun Li, Rui Zhou, Rahul Sajnani, Xiaoyan Cong, Daniel Ritchie, Srinath Sridhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenHSI is a training-free method for generating long human-scene interaction videos by subdividing the task into script writing, pre-visualization, and animation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models struggle with generating long, realistic human-scene interaction videos due to unrealistic interactions, identity loss, and high training costs.

Method: The method involves three stages: script writing (breaking tasks into atomic actions), pre-visualization (creating 3D keyframes), and animation (using off-the-shelf models).

Result: GenHSI generates long videos with preserved scene content, character identity, and plausible interactions from a single image.

Conclusion: GenHSI successfully addresses limitations of prior work, offering a scalable, training-free solution for long video generation.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

*Zirui Wang, Yash Bhalgat, Ruining Li, Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes active view selection for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction as a 2D image quality assessment task, using a cross-reference IQA framework for efficiency and representation-agnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for view selection are complex and require specialized designs for different 3D representations. The paper aims to simplify this by leveraging 2D image quality assessment.

Method: Proposes a cross-reference IQA framework to predict SSIM in a multi-view setup, guiding view selection without ground-truth images.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in benchmarks, runs 14-33 times faster, and is agnostic to 3D representations.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies view selection, outperforms existing methods in speed and performance, and is adaptable to various 3D representations.

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of NAFNet's core components (SimpleGate, SCA, LayerNorm) in image restoration tasks.

Method: Ablation study on CIFAR10 images corrupted with noise/blur, comparing baseline NAFNet to variants with removed/replaced components.

Result: SimpleGate and simplified attention outperform conventional methods; LayerNorm ensures stable training.

Conclusion: NAFNet's design is validated, with recommendations for future improvements.

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient
deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted
with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components.
Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel
Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different
variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future
work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVLA is a unified vision-language-action model that autoregressively models multimodal signals as token sequences, leveraging world modeling for better causal dynamics and outperforming previous methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLAs rely on general VLMs for action signals, missing the temporal and causal structure in visual observations. UniVLA addresses this gap.

Method: UniVLA models vision, language, and action as discrete token sequences, enabling flexible multimodal learning from large-scale video data and incorporating world modeling.

Result: UniVLA achieves state-of-the-art results, e.g., 95.5% success on LIBERO vs. 85.5% for pi0-FAST, and shows real-world applicability in manipulation and driving.

Conclusion: UniVLA's unified approach and world modeling effectively capture causal dynamics, advancing robotic manipulation and setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimaX is a 3D animation framework that combines video diffusion models with skeleton-based animation, enabling scalable and efficient motion synthesis for diverse articulated meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion synthesis methods are limited by fixed skeletal topologies or high-dimensional optimization, prompting the need for a more flexible and efficient solution.

Method: AnimaX uses multi-view, multi-frame 2D pose maps and joint video-pose diffusion, with shared positional encodings and modality-aware embeddings for alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VBench in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Conclusion: AnimaX offers a scalable, category-agnostic solution for 3D animation, bridging video and 3D motion priors effectively.

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DaMO is a data-efficient Video LLM designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding, outperforming prior methods in tasks requiring precise temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal reasoning, limiting their ability to attribute responses to specific video moments under constrained supervision.

Method: DaMO uses a Temporal-aware Fuseformer with a hierarchical dual-stream architecture for temporal dynamics and multimodal fusion, plus a global residual for efficiency. Training involves a four-stage progressive paradigm.

Result: DaMO surpasses prior methods in temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks, especially in tasks needing precise temporal alignment.

Conclusion: DaMO sets a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling, addressing limitations in temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

### [161] [Progressive Cross-Stream Cooperation in Spatial and Temporal Domain for Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11575)
*Rui Su, Dong Xu, Luping Zhou, Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a progressive cross-stream cooperation (PCSC) framework to enhance spatio-temporal action localization by improving spatial and temporal localization and action classification through iterative feature and proposal sharing between RGB and Flow streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in accurately localizing actions spatially and temporally while improving action classification, the paper proposes leveraging cross-stream cooperation between RGB and Flow streams.

Method: The PCSC framework combines region and segment proposals from both streams for better training samples and introduces a message passing approach to share information between streams, improving detection models iteratively.

Result: Experiments on UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB datasets show the framework's effectiveness in improving action localization accuracy in realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: The PCSC framework successfully enhances spatio-temporal action localization by progressively refining spatial and temporal detection through cross-stream cooperation.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal action localization consists of three levels of tasks:
spatial localization, action classification, and temporal localization. In this
work, we propose a new progressive cross-stream cooperation (PCSC) framework
that improves all three tasks above. The basic idea is to utilize both spatial
region (resp., temporal segment proposals) and features from one stream (i.e.,
the Flow/RGB stream) to help another stream (i.e., the RGB/Flow stream) to
iteratively generate better bounding boxes in the spatial domain (resp.,
temporal segments in the temporal domain). In this way, not only the actions
could be more accurately localized both spatially and temporally, but also the
action classes could be predicted more precisely. Specifically, we first
combine the latest region proposals (for spatial detection) or segment
proposals (for temporal localization) from both streams to form a larger set of
labelled training samples to help learn better action detection or segment
detection models. Second, to learn better representations, we also propose a
new message passing approach to pass information from one stream to another
stream, which also leads to better action detection and segment detection
models. By first using our newly proposed PCSC framework for spatial
localization at the frame-level and then applying our temporal PCSC framework
for temporal localization at the tube-level, the action localization results
are progressively improved at both the frame level and the video level.
Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB
demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed approaches for
spatio-temporal action localization in realistic scenarios.

*Yueming Lyu, Kang Zhao, Bo Peng, Huafeng Chen, Yue Jiang, Yingya Zhang, Jing Dong, Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeltaEdit leverages CLIP DeltaSpace for text-guided image editing, enabling text-free training and zero-shot inference without extensive data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and limitations of existing methods for text-guided image editing, which rely on expensive data collection or restrictive optimization.

Method: Identifies CLIP DeltaSpace for semantic alignment of visual and textual feature differences, then maps these to latent space directions in generative models.

Result: DeltaEdit achieves flexible text-guided editing across GAN and diffusion models, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DeltaEdit offers a versatile, efficient solution for text-guided image editing, eliminating the need for annotated data and enabling generalization.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing faces significant challenges when considering
training and inference flexibility. Much literature collects large amounts of
annotated image-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from
scratch, which is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that
leverage pre-trained vision-language models have been proposed to avoid data
collection, but they are limited by either per text-prompt optimization or
inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate
and identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP
visual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP
textual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on
DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP
visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model
during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the
CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design
endows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2)
generalization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with
different generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion
model, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing. Code is available at

### [163] [Cross-Level Multi-Instance Distillation for Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Visual Categorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08860)
*Qi Bi, Wei Ji, Jingjun Yi, Haolan Zhan, Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation (CMD) framework to improve self-supervised learning for fine-grained visual representation by focusing on key image patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality annotation for fine-grained categories is costly, and existing self-supervised methods underperform due to patch-wise embedding limitations.

Method: The CMD framework uses multi-instance learning to weigh patch importance, with intra- and inter-level distillation between teacher and student networks.

Result: CMD outperforms contemporary methods by up to 10.14% and state-of-the-art approaches by up to 19.78% on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: CMD effectively addresses the challenge of learning fine-grained representations by leveraging patch importance and multi-instance distillation.

Abstract: High-quality annotation of fine-grained visual categories demands great
expert knowledge, which is taxing and time consuming. Alternatively, learning
fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g.,
species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution.
However, recent researches find that existing self-supervised learning methods
are less qualified to represent fine-grained categories. The bottleneck lies in
that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding,
while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an
image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation
(CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the
importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text
representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the
relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the
multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image
crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside
the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance
distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation. Extensive experiments
on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft show that the proposed method
outperforms the contemporary method by upto 10.14% and existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches by upto 19.78% on both
top-1 accuracy and Rank-1 retrieval metric.

*Justin Kay, Timm Haucke, Suzanne Stathatos, Siqi Deng, Erik Young, Pietro Perona, Sara Beery, Grant Van Horn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies benchmarking issues in domain adaptive object detection (DAOD), introduces a unified framework (ALDI), a new benchmark dataset (CFC-DAOD), and a state-of-the-art method (ALDI++).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systemic pitfalls in DAOD benchmarking, including overestimation, inconsistent practices, and lack of generality.

Method: Introduces ALDI (a benchmarking framework), a fair protocol, CFC-DAOD dataset, and ALDI++ (a new DAOD method).

Result: ALDI++ outperforms prior methods by significant margins (e.g., +3.5 AP50 on Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes).

Conclusion: The framework, dataset, and method reset DAOD research, providing a strong foundation for future work.

Abstract: Object detectors often perform poorly on data that differs from their
training set. Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) methods have recently
demonstrated strong results on addressing this challenge. Unfortunately, we
identify systemic benchmarking pitfalls that call past results into question
and hamper further progress: (a) Overestimation of performance due to
underpowered baselines, (b) Inconsistent implementation practices preventing
transparent comparisons of methods, and (c) Lack of generality due to outdated
backbones and lack of diversity in benchmarks. We address these problems by
introducing: (1) A unified benchmarking and implementation framework, Align and
Distill (ALDI), enabling comparison of DAOD methods and supporting future
development, (2) A fair and modern training and evaluation protocol for DAOD
that addresses benchmarking pitfalls, (3) A new DAOD benchmark dataset,
CFC-DAOD, enabling evaluation on diverse real-world data, and (4) A new method,
ALDI++, that achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin. ALDI++
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by +3.5 AP50 on Cityscapes to Foggy
Cityscapes, +5.7 AP50 on Sim10k to Cityscapes (where ours is the only method to
outperform a fair baseline), and +0.6 AP50 on CFC Kenai to Channel. ALDI and
ALDI++ are architecture-agnostic, setting a new state-of-the-art for YOLO and
DETR-based DAOD as well without additional hyperparameter tuning. Our
framework, dataset, and state-of-the-art method offer a critical reset for DAOD
and provide a strong foundation for future research. Code and data are

### [165] [Cross-sensor self-supervised training and alignment for remote sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09922)
*Valerio Marsocci, Nicolas Audebert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-STARS introduces cross-sensor self-supervised training for remote sensing, using MSAD loss to align representations across sensors of varying resolutions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage vast unlabeled remote sensing data while addressing challenges of sensor multiplicity and varying data availability (low vs. high resolution).

Method: Proposes X-STARS with MSAD loss for cross-sensor alignment, applicable for training from scratch or adapting pretrained models. Uses MSC-France dataset.

Result: X-STARS outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly across seven downstream tasks, even with less data.

Conclusion: X-STARS effectively addresses sensor agnosticism and data scarcity, demonstrating superior performance in remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale ''foundation models'' have gained traction as a way to leverage
the vast amounts of unlabeled remote sensing data collected every day. However,
due to the multiplicity of Earth Observation satellites, these models should
learn ''sensor agnostic'' representations, that generalize across sensor
characteristics with minimal fine-tuning. This is complicated by data
availability, as low-resolution imagery, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data,
are available in large amounts, while very high-resolution aerial or satellite
data is less common. To tackle these challenges, we introduce cross-sensor
self-supervised training and alignment for remote sensing (X-STARS). We design
a self-supervised training loss, the Multi-Sensor Alignment Dense loss (MSAD),
to align representations across sensors, even with vastly different
resolutions. Our X-STARS can be applied to train models from scratch, or to
adapt large models pretrained on e.g low-resolution EO data to new
high-resolution sensors, in a continual pretraining framework. We collect and
release MSC-France, a new multi-sensor dataset, on which we train our X-STARS
models, then evaluated on seven downstream classification and segmentation
tasks. We demonstrate that X-STARS outperform s the state-of-the-art by a
significant margin with less data across various conditions of data
availability and resolutions.

*Hao Zhang, Di Chang, Fang Li, Mohammad Soleymani, Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicPose4D is a novel framework for precise 4D content generation, using motion prompts from videos or mesh sequences for better control over appearance and motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D generation methods rely on text prompts, which often fail to define complex or rare motions accurately.

Method: MagicPose4D includes a Dual-Phase 4D Reconstruction Module for shape and motion extraction, and a Cross-category Motion Transfer Module for motion generalization.

Result: The framework improves accuracy and consistency in 4D generation, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: MagicPose4D offers refined control and robust generalization for 4D content generation, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: With the success of 2D and 3D visual generative models, there is growing
interest in generating 4D content. Existing methods primarily rely on text
prompts to produce 4D content, but they often fall short of accurately defining
complex or rare motions. To address this limitation, we propose MagicPose4D, a
novel framework for refined control over both appearance and motion in 4D
generation. Unlike current 4D generation methods, MagicPose4D accepts monocular
videos or mesh sequences as motion prompts, enabling precise and customizable
motion control. MagicPose4D comprises two key modules: (i) Dual-Phase 4D
Reconstruction Module, which operates in two phases. The first phase focuses on
capturing the model's shape using accurate 2D supervision and less accurate but
geometrically informative 3D pseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton
constraints. The second phase extracts the 3D motion (skeleton poses) using
more accurate pseudo-3D supervision, obtained in the first phase and introduces
kinematic chain-based skeleton constraints to ensure physical plausibility.
Additionally, we propose a Global-local Chamfer loss that aligns the overall
distribution of predicted mesh vertices with the supervision while maintaining
part-level alignment without extra annotations. (ii) Cross-category Motion
Transfer Module, which leverages the extracted motion from the 4D
reconstruction module and uses a kinematic-chain-based skeleton to achieve
cross-category motion transfer. It ensures smooth transitions between frames
through dynamic rigidity, facilitating robust generalization without additional
training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MagicPose4D
significantly improves the accuracy and consistency of 4D content generation,
outperforming existing methods in various benchmarks.

*Jian Chen, Peilin Zhou, Yining Hua, Dading Chong, Meng Cao, Yaowei Li, Zixuan Yuan, Bing Zhu, Junwei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPOT algorithm improves VLMs' ability to analyze meteorological heatmaps by localizing irregular shapes. ClimateIQA dataset and Climate-Zoo models enhance accuracy in weather feature interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with precise color identification and spatial localization in complex meteorological heatmaps, leading to inaccurate interpretations.

Method: Introduces SPOT for spatial coordinate extraction of irregular shapes, ClimateIQA dataset for VLM training, and Climate-Zoo fine-tuned models.

Result: Climate-Zoo outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks, improving accuracy in weather feature analysis.

Conclusion: SPOT and ClimateIQA advance VLM capabilities for extreme weather interpretation, with Climate-Zoo demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather
phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours,
unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical
hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current
state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks
such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in
inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we
introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm
specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual
data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial
coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building
on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120
instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and
heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial
cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in
interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop
Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA,
which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap
tasks.

### [168] [MDeRainNet: An Efficient Macro-pixel Image Rain Removal Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10652)
*Tao Yan, Weijiang He, Chenglong Wang, Cihang Wei, Xiangjie Zhu, Yinghui Wang, Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDeRainNet, a network for rain streak removal in light field images, leveraging multi-scale encoder-decoder architecture and a novel transformer-based module for global correlation modeling, along with semi-supervised learning for real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rain degrades image quality, hindering computer vision systems. Light field images offer multiple sub-views and depth information, but existing methods underutilize these features, leading to sub-optimal rain removal.

Method: Proposes MDeRainNet with a multi-scale encoder-decoder on Macro-pixel images, an Extended Spatial-Angular Interaction (ESAI) module, and a transformer-based Spatial-Angular Interaction Attention (SAIA) block. Uses semi-supervised learning with multi-level KL loss and contrastive regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world light field images, achieving better rain removal and generalization.

Conclusion: MDeRainNet effectively removes rain streaks by fully utilizing light field data and semi-supervised learning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Since rainy weather always degrades image quality and poses significant
challenges to most computer vision-based intelligent systems, image de-raining
has been a hot research topic. Fortunately, in a rainy light field (LF) image,
background obscured by rain streaks in one sub-view may be visible in the other
sub-views, and implicit depth information and recorded 4D structural
information may benefit rain streak detection and removal. However, existing LF
image rain removal methods either do not fully exploit the global correlations
of 4D LF data or only utilize partial sub-views, resulting in sub-optimal rain
removal performance and no-equally good quality for all de-rained sub-views. In
this paper, we propose an efficient network, called MDeRainNet, for rain streak
removal from LF images. The proposed network adopts a multi-scale
encoder-decoder architecture, which directly works on Macro-pixel images (MPIs)
to improve the rain removal performance. To fully model the global correlation
between the spatial and the angular information, we propose an Extended
Spatial-Angular Interaction (ESAI) module to merge them, in which a simple and
effective Transformer-based Spatial-Angular Interaction Attention (SAIA) block
is also proposed for modeling long-range geometric correlations and making full
use of the angular information. Furthermore, to improve the generalization
performance of our network on real-world rainy scenes, we propose a novel
semi-supervised learning framework for our MDeRainNet, which utilizes
multi-level KL loss to bridge the domain gap between features of synthetic and
real-world rain streaks and introduces colored-residue image guided contrastive
regularization to reconstruct rain-free images. Extensive experiments conducted
on synthetic and real-world LFIs demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

### [169] [Exclusive Style Removal for Cross Domain Novel Class Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18140)
*Yicheng Wang, Feng Liu, Junmin Liu, Kai Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores Novel Class Discovery (NCD) in cross-domain settings, proposing a style removal module to improve performance when novel classes differ in distribution from labeled data. It also introduces a benchmark for fair NCD evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCD methods struggle when novel classes come from a different distribution than labeled data. The paper aims to address this by removing style information, a necessary condition for solving cross-domain NCD.

Method: Introduces an exclusive style removal module to extract style information distinct from baseline features, enhancing inference. This module is designed as a plug-in for existing NCD methods.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the style removal strategy in improving NCD performance for novel classes with different distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed style removal module and benchmark advance NCD research by addressing cross-domain challenges and ensuring fair evaluation.

Abstract: As a promising field in open-world learning, \textit{Novel Class Discovery}
(NCD) is usually a task to cluster unseen novel classes in an unlabeled set
based on the prior knowledge of labeled data within the same domain. However,
the performance of existing NCD methods could be severely compromised when
novel classes are sampled from a different distribution with the labeled ones.
In this paper, we explore and establish the solvability of NCD with cross
domain setting under the necessary condition that the style information needs
to be removed. Based on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an exclusive
style removal module for extracting style information that is distinctive from
the baseline features, thereby facilitating inference. Moreover, this module is
easy to integrate with other NCD methods, acting as a plug-in to improve
performance on novel classes with different distributions compared to the
labeled set. Additionally, recognizing the non-negligible influence of
different backbones and pre-training strategies on the performance of the NCD
methods, we build a fair benchmark for future NCD research. Extensive
experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed style removal strategy.

*Haodong Chen, Haojian Huang, Junhao Dong, Mingzhe Zheng, Dian Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineCLIPER improves DFER by using multi-modal fine-grained CLIP with hierarchical semantic mining and PEFT, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DFER methods underperform due to poor data quality, underutilized dynamics, and ambiguous semantics.

Method: Extends labels to textual descriptions, uses hierarchical semantic mining (frames, masks, landmarks, MLLM descriptions), and applies PEFT for efficient adaptation.

Result: Achieves SOTA on DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW datasets in supervised and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: FineCLIPER effectively addresses DFER challenges with innovative multi-modal and hierarchical approaches.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is crucial for understanding
human behavior. However, current methods exhibit limited performance mainly due
to the scarcity of high-quality data, the insufficient utilization of facial
dynamics, and the ambiguity of expression semantics, etc. To this end, we
propose a novel framework, named Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Dynamic
Facial Expression Recognition with AdaptERs (FineCLIPER), incorporating the
following novel designs: 1) To better distinguish between similar facial
expressions, we extend the class labels to textual descriptions from both
positive and negative aspects, and obtain supervision by calculating the
cross-modal similarity based on the CLIP model; 2) Our FineCLIPER adopts a
hierarchical manner to effectively mine useful cues from DFE videos.
Specifically, besides directly embedding video frames as input (low semantic
level), we propose to extract the face segmentation masks and landmarks based
on each frame (middle semantic level) and utilize the Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to further generate detailed descriptions of facial
changes across frames with designed prompts (high semantic level).
Additionally, we also adopt Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to enable
efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models (i.e., CLIP) for this task.
Our FineCLIPER achieves SOTA performance on the DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW
datasets in both supervised and zero-shot settings with few tunable parameters.

*Daixun Li, Weiying Xie, Mingxiang Cao, Yunke Wang, Yusi Zhang, Leyuan Fang, Yunsong Li, Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM into multimodal image segmentation, proposing LSTG and FMP modules to improve segmentation accuracy in autonomous driving and other multimodal scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with densely packed elements due to inadequate fusion features. SAM's potential in multimodal segmentation is unexplored.

Method: Combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) to transform training into a prompt-based mechanism, using cross-attention for fusion.

Result: Outperforms SAM and SAM2, achieving a 4.1% improvement in mIoU for autonomous driving and other multimodal scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances multimodal segmentation by leveraging SAM's prompting capabilities and comprehensive fusion features.

Abstract: Multimodal image fusion and semantic segmentation are critical for autonomous
driving. Despite advancements, current models often struggle with segmenting
densely packed elements due to a lack of comprehensive fusion features for
guidance during training. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) allows precise
control during fine-tuning through its flexible prompting encoder, its
potential remains largely unexplored in the context of multimodal segmentation
for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image
segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines
Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules.
This approach transforms the training methodology for multimodal segmentation
from a traditional black-box approach to a controllable, prompt-based
mechanism. Specifically, we obtain latent space features for both modalities
through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based
inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between
modalities. We then use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide
precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple public
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in
multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving an average improvement of
4.1$\%$ over the state-of-the-art method in segmentation mIoU, and the
performance is also optimized in other multi-modal visual scenes.

### [172] [ReconX: Reconstruct Any Scene from Sparse Views with Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16767)
*Fangfu Liu, Wenqiang Sun, Hanyang Wang, Yikai Wang, Haowen Sun, Junliang Ye, Jun Zhang, Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconX introduces a novel 3D scene reconstruction method using pre-trained video diffusion models to address sparse-view reconstruction, ensuring 3D consistency and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with sparse-view reconstruction, leading to artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. ReconX aims to solve this by leveraging generative priors from video diffusion models.

Method: ReconX constructs a global point cloud as a 3D structure condition, guides a video diffusion model to synthesize consistent frames, and recovers the 3D scene using Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Experiments show ReconX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and generalizability.

Conclusion: ReconX effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges by combining generative models with 3D consistency techniques.

Abstract: Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the
real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of
input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios,
rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an
ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in
unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction
paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal
generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of
large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction.
However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly
generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited
input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and
encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the
condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are
both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the
coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D
scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting
optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show
the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality
and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainSAIL links neural selectivity to semantic visual concepts in natural scenes using pre-trained vision models and a novel denoising process, enabling precise localization of visual selectivity in the brain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the brain processes semantic visual information in natural scenes by leveraging advances in artificial neural networks.

Method: BrainSAIL uses pre-trained vision models for dense spatial features, applies a denoising process, and employs voxel-wise encoding models to identify image subregions driving neural selectivity.

Result: Validated on cortical regions, BrainSAIL accurately localizes and disentangles selectivity to diverse visual concepts, including scene properties and low-level features.

Conclusion: BrainSAIL advances the mapping and decomposition of high-level visual representations in the human brain.

Abstract: We introduce BrainSAIL, a method for linking neural selectivity with
spatially distributed semantic visual concepts in natural scenes. BrainSAIL
leverages recent advances in large-scale artificial neural networks, using them
to provide insights into the functional topology of the brain. To overcome the
challenge presented by the co-occurrence of multiple categories in natural
images, BrainSAIL exploits semantically consistent, dense spatial features from
pre-trained vision models, building upon their demonstrated ability to robustly
predict neural activity. This method derives clean, spatially dense embeddings
without requiring any additional training, and employs a novel denoising
process that leverages the semantic consistency of images under random
augmentations. By unifying the space of whole-image embeddings and dense visual
features and then applying voxel-wise encoding models to these features, we
enable the identification of specific subregions of each image which drive
selectivity patterns in different areas of the higher visual cortex. This
provides a powerful tool for dissecting the neural mechanisms that underlie
semantic visual processing for natural images. We validate BrainSAIL on
cortical regions with known category selectivity, demonstrating its ability to
accurately localize and disentangle selectivity to diverse visual concepts.
Next, we demonstrate BrainSAIL's ability to characterize high-level visual
selectivity to scene properties and low-level visual features such as depth,
luminance, and saturation, providing insights into the encoding of complex
visual information. Finally, we use BrainSAIL to directly compare the feature
selectivity of different brain encoding models across different regions of
interest in visual cortex. Our innovative method paves the way for significant
advances in mapping and decomposing high-level visual representations in the
human brain.

*Tsiry Mayet, Pourya Shamsolmoali, Simon Bernard, Eric Granger, Romain Hérault, Clement Chatelain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TD-Paint accelerates diffusion-based inpainting by modeling variable noise levels at the pixel level, improving sampling speed without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for inpainting are slow due to inefficient use of input conditions early in sampling, leading to deviations from the data manifold.

Method: Proposes TD-Paint, which adapts the diffusion process by embedding known pixel values early, guiding generation efficiently.

Result: TD-Paint achieves faster sampling times without architectural changes, outperforming state-of-the-art models on three datasets.

Conclusion: TD-Paint offers a scalable solution for real-world inpainting by balancing speed and quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as highly effective techniques for inpainting,
however, they remain constrained by slow sampling rates. While recent advances
have enhanced generation quality, they have also increased sampling time,
thereby limiting scalability in real-world applications. We investigate the
generative sampling process of diffusion-based inpainting models and observe
that these models make minimal use of the input condition during the initial
sampling steps. As a result, the sampling trajectory deviates from the data
manifold, requiring complex synchronization mechanisms to realign the
generation process. To address this, we propose Time-aware Diffusion Paint
(TD-Paint), a novel approach that adapts the diffusion process by modeling
variable noise levels at the pixel level. This technique allows the model to
efficiently use known pixel values from the start, guiding the generation
process toward the target manifold. By embedding this information early in the
diffusion process, TD-Paint significantly accelerates sampling without
compromising image quality. Unlike conventional diffusion-based inpainting
models, which require a dedicated architecture or an expensive generation loop,
TD-Paint achieves faster sampling times without architectural modifications.
Experimental results across three datasets show that TD-Paint outperforms
state-of-the-art diffusion models while maintaining lower complexity.

*Yui Tatsumi, Shoko Tanaka, Shunsuke Akamatsu, Takahiro Shindo, Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for Japanese Sign Language (JSL) recognition using neural networks to classify sentence types based on facial expressions, achieving 96.05% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on JSL recognition due to lack of datasets, necessitating models that incorporate both manual and non-manual features for better communication with deaf individuals.

Method: Proposes a neural network-based approach to analyze facial features and classify JSL sentence types (e.g., affirmative statements vs. questions).

Result: Achieved a high classification accuracy of 96.05% in experiments.

Conclusion: The method effectively recognizes JSL sentence types through facial expressions, demonstrating its potential for improving communication tools for the deaf.

Abstract: Sign language is a visual language expressed through hand movements and
non-manual markers. Non-manual markers include facial expressions and head
movements. These expressions vary across different nations. Therefore,
specialized analysis methods for each sign language are necessary. However,
research on Japanese Sign Language (JSL) recognition is limited due to a lack
of datasets. The development of recognition models that consider both manual
and non-manual features of JSL is crucial for precise and smooth communication
with deaf individuals. In JSL, sentence types such as affirmative statements
and questions are distinguished by facial expressions. In this paper, we
propose a JSL recognition method that focuses on facial expressions. Our
proposed method utilizes a neural network to analyze facial features and
classify sentence types. Through the experiments, we confirm our method's
effectiveness by achieving a classification accuracy of 96.05%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjCtrl-2.5D enhances object control in image-to-video generation by using 3D trajectories and camera poses, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D trajectory methods for object control in I2V generation often produce unnatural results and fail to capture user intention.

Method: ObjCtrl-2.5D extends 2D trajectories to 3D with depth, models object movement as camera poses, and isolates objects for local control.

Result: The method improves accuracy over training-free approaches and offers more diverse control than training-based 2D methods, enabling complex effects like rotation.

Conclusion: ObjCtrl-2.5D provides precise and versatile object control in I2V generation without requiring additional training.

Abstract: This study aims to achieve more precise and versatile object control in
image-to-video (I2V) generation. Current methods typically represent the
spatial movement of target objects with 2D trajectories, which often fail to
capture user intention and frequently produce unnatural results. To enhance
control, we present ObjCtrl-2.5D, a training-free object control approach that
uses a 3D trajectory, extended from a 2D trajectory with depth information, as
a control signal. By modeling object movement as camera movement, ObjCtrl-2.5D
represents the 3D trajectory as a sequence of camera poses, enabling object
motion control using an existing camera motion control I2V generation model
(CMC-I2V) without training. To adapt the CMC-I2V model originally designed for
global motion control to handle local object motion, we introduce a module to
isolate the target object from the background, enabling independent local
control. In addition, we devise an effective way to achieve more accurate
object control by sharing low-frequency warped latent within the object's
region across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjCtrl-2.5D
significantly improves object control accuracy compared to training-free
methods and offers more diverse control capabilities than training-based
approaches using 2D trajectories, enabling complex effects like object
rotation. Code and results are available at

TL;DR: HART introduces a novel attention mechanism (DAK and MKOI) to overcome the low-rank bottleneck in stereo matching transformers, improving feature representation in challenging conditions like reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereo matching transformers suffer from limited nonlinear expressivity due to low-rank bottlenecks, making them sensitive to challenging conditions like reflections.

Method: HART includes DAK for high-dimensional attention weight mapping and MKOI for unifying semantic and spatial knowledge learning.

Result: HART achieved 1st place on the KITTI 2012 benchmark for reflective areas.

Conclusion: HART effectively addresses the limitations of current transformers, enhancing feature learning and performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Constrained by the low-rank bottleneck inherent in attention mechanisms,
current stereo matching transformers suffer from limited nonlinear
expressivity, which renders their feature representations sensitive to
challenging conditions such as reflections. To overcome this difficulty, we
present the Hadamard Attention Recurrent Stereo Transformer (HART). HART
includes a novel attention mechanism that incorporates the following
components: 1) The Dense Attention Kernel (DAK) maps the attention weight
distribution into a high-dimensional space over (0, +$\infty$). By removing the
upper bound constraint on attention weights, DAK enables more flexible modeling
of complex feature interactions. This reduces feature collinearity. 2) The
Multi Kernel & Order Interaction (MKOI) module extends the attention mechanism
by unifying semantic and spatial knowledge learning. This integration improves
the ability of HART to learn features in binocular images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our HART. In reflective area, HART ranked 1st
on the KITTI 2012 benchmark among all published methods at the time of
submission. Code is available at https://github.com/ZYangChen/HART.

*Wenshu Fan, Minxing Zhang, Hongwei Li, Wenbo Jiang, Hanxiao Chen, Xiangyu Yue, Michael Backes, Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynTracker, a dynamic facial recognition (FR) strategy that updates its gallery database iteratively, rendering existing anti-facial recognition (AFR) methods ineffective. It proposes DivTrackee, a novel AFR method promoting diversity in protected images to counter DynTracker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about misuse of FR models and the inadequacy of static FR strategies in evaluating AFR efficacy motivated the development of DynTracker and DivTrackee.

Method: DynTracker dynamically updates its gallery database with new images. DivTrackee crafts diverse AFR protections using text-guided image generation and diversity-promoting adversarial losses.

Result: DynTracker breaks existing AFR methods, while DivTrackee effectively prevents identification by dynamic FR strategies.

Conclusion: The work advances AFR methods by addressing the limitations of static evaluations and promoting diversity, offering better protection against determined trackers.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of facial recognition (FR) models raises serious
concerns about their potential misuse, motivating the development of
anti-facial recognition (AFR) to protect user facial privacy. In this paper, we
argue that the static FR strategy, predominantly adopted in prior literature
for evaluating AFR efficacy, cannot faithfully characterize the actual
capabilities of determined trackers who aim to track a specific target
identity. In particular, we introduce DynTracker, a dynamic FR strategy where
the model's gallery database is iteratively updated with newly recognized
target identity images. Surprisingly, such a simple approach renders all the
existing AFR protections ineffective. To mitigate the privacy threats posed by
DynTracker, we advocate for explicitly promoting diversity in the AFR-protected
images. We hypothesize that the lack of diversity is the primary cause of the
failure of existing AFR methods. Specifically, we develop DivTrackee, a novel
method for crafting diverse AFR protections that builds upon a text-guided
image generation framework and diversity-promoting adversarial losses. Through
comprehensive experiments on various image benchmarks and feature extractors,
we demonstrate DynTracker's strength in breaking existing AFR methods and the
superiority of DivTrackee in preventing user facial images from being
identified by dynamic FR strategies. We believe our work can act as an
important initial step towards developing more effective AFR methods for
protecting user facial privacy against determined trackers.

*Yepeng Liu, Zhichao Sun, Baosheng Yu, Yitian Zhao, Bo Du, Yongchao Xu, Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MIFNet for modality-invariant feature learning in multimodal image matching using single-modality data, leveraging Stable Diffusion features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multimodal data due to non-linear variations; acquiring aligned multimodal data is costly.

Method: Uses latent and cumulative hybrid aggregation modules to enhance single-modality descriptors with Stable Diffusion features.

Result: Validated on retinal and remote sensing datasets, showing robust zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: MIFNet learns modality-invariant features without targeted modality data, offering practical solutions for multimodal matching.

Abstract: Many keypoint detection and description methods have been proposed for image
matching or registration. While these methods demonstrate promising performance
for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data
because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness
against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such
methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal
data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is
often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to
compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal
image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we
propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid
aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on
single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion
models. %, our approach generates robust and invariant features across diverse
and unknown modalities. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection
and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA,
CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and
Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is
able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without
accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability.
The code will be released at https://github.com/lyp-deeplearning/MIFNet.

*Yifan Shen, Peiyuan Zhu, Zijian Li, Shaoan Xie, Zeyu Tang, Namrata Deka, Zongfang Liu, Guangyi Chen, Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoVoGAN disentangles video concepts for precise control in generation, improving quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained control in video generation, limiting precision and efficiency.

Method: Disentangles static/dynamic latent variables, ensures component-wise identifiability, and uses a Temporal Transition Module.

Result: Improved generation quality and controllability in diverse real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CoVoGAN offers a theoretically grounded, efficient approach for controllable video generation.

Abstract: Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent
advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing
methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting
intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control
precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video
Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,
thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.
Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle
static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change
property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,
enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical
foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of
our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal
Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change
principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of
latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To
validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation
quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.

### [181] [Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02514)
*Antoni Kowalczuk, Jan Dubiński, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IARs match DMs in image quality but pose higher privacy risks, demonstrated by a novel MIA with 86.38% success rate and dataset inference requiring only 6 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unexplored privacy risks of IARs compared to DMs, given their increasing use despite potential vulnerabilities.

Method: Developed a novel membership inference attack (MIA) and dataset inference (DI) to evaluate privacy risks in IARs versus DMs.

Result: IARs show significantly higher privacy risks (86.38% MIA success rate, 6 samples for DI) compared to DMs (6.38% MIA, 200 samples for DI).

Conclusion: IARs offer superior image generation quality and speed but are more vulnerable to privacy attacks, highlighting a privacy-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive generation has emerged as a new powerful paradigm with
image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models
(DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for a higher
generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain
unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address
this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their
privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a
novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success
rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive
Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our
novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires
as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in
DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to
extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30).
Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel
in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more
vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance.
We release the code at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars
for reproducibility.

*Weihang Li, Hongli Xu, Junwen Huang, Hyunjun Jung, Peter KT Yu, Nassir Navab, Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCE-Pose improves category-level pose estimation by using a first-complete-then-aggregate strategy with global context priors, outperforming existing methods on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for model-free category-level pose estimation struggle with partial visibility and lack generalization across instances.

Method: GCE-Pose uses a Semantic Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module to reconstruct global geometry and semantics, and a Global Context Enhanced (GCE) feature fusion module to combine partial observations with reconstructed context.

Result: GCE-Pose significantly outperforms existing methods on HouseCat6D and NOCS-REAL275 datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of global context priors and effective feature fusion enhances pose estimation for novel instances under partial visibility.

Abstract: A key challenge in model-free category-level pose estimation is the
extraction of contextual object features that generalize across varying
instances within a specific category. Recent approaches leverage foundational
features to capture semantic and geometry cues from data. However, these
approaches fail under partial visibility. We overcome this with a
first-complete-then-aggregate strategy for feature extraction utilizing class
priors. In this paper, we present GCE-Pose, a method that enhances pose
estimation for novel instances by integrating category-level global context
prior. GCE-Pose performs semantic shape reconstruction with a proposed Semantic
Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module. Given an unseen partial RGB-D object
instance, our SSR module reconstructs the instance's global geometry and
semantics by deforming category-specific 3D semantic prototypes through a
learned deep Linear Shape Model. We further introduce a Global Context Enhanced
(GCE) feature fusion module that effectively fuses features from partial RGB-D
observations and the reconstructed global context. Extensive experiments
validate the impact of our global context prior and the effectiveness of the
GCE fusion module, demonstrating that GCE-Pose significantly outperforms
existing methods on challenging real-world datasets HouseCat6D and
NOCS-REAL275. Our project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New equivariant neural networks preserve symmetry with comparable FLOPs to standard networks, focusing on horizontal mirroring invariance for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing parameter efficiency in neural networks while avoiding increased computational costs from geometric invariance.

Method: Parametrize feature spaces into mirror-symmetric and antisymmetric features, decomposing linear layers into block-diagonal forms to halve FLOPs.

Result: Reduces both FLOPs and wall-clock time, offering efficient symmetry-aware architectures.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for scalable, efficient neural networks with preserved symmetry.

Abstract: Incorporating geometric invariance into neural networks enhances parameter
efficiency but typically increases computational costs. This paper introduces
new equivariant neural networks that preserve symmetry while maintaining a
comparable number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per parameter to
standard non-equivariant networks. We focus on horizontal mirroring (flopping)
invariance, common in many computer vision tasks. The main idea is to
parametrize the feature spaces in terms of mirror-symmetric and
mirror-antisymmetric features, i.e., irreps of the flopping group. This
decomposes the linear layers to be block-diagonal, requiring half the number of
FLOPs. Our approach reduces both FLOPs and wall-clock time, providing a
practical solution for efficient, scalable symmetry-aware architectures.

*Masoumeh Chapariniya, Hossein Ranjbar, Teodora Vukovic, Sarah Ebling, Volker Dellwo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework is proposed for person identification using conversational keypoints, achieving robust performance against deepfake challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of traditional biometric systems to deepfake and face reenactment techniques by leveraging upper body keypoints.

Method: Uses a Spatial Transformer (STR) for structural patterns and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) for motion patterns, fused via shared loss or feature-level methods.

Result: Achieved 94.86% accuracy with feature-level fusion, outperforming individual streams (80.12% for spatial, 63.61% for temporal).

Conclusion: The framework provides robust identity signatures by combining static and dynamic features, enhancing resistance to spoofing.

Abstract: In the age of AI-driven generative technologies, traditional biometric
recognition systems face unprecedented challenges, particularly from
sophisticated deepfake and face reenactment techniques. In this study, we
propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person
identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations,
which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial
relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two
specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive
structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer
(TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art
Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody
format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The
framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural
conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial
stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies:
a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level
fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly
improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical
relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive
identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional
appearance-based methods.

*Chaozhi Zhang, Wenxiang Ding, Roy Y. He, Xiaoqun Zhang, Qiaoqiao Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NINRF introduces an unsupervised learning method for dynamic PET image reconstruction using low-rank matrix factorization and neural networks, achieving continuous representations and outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic PET image reconstruction is challenging due to noisy projection data. The paper aims to bridge non-negative matrix factorization with continuous functions for better reconstruction.

Method: Proposes Non-negative Implicit Neural Representation Factorization (NINRF), using neural networks to represent coefficients and bases, minimizing KL divergence with sparsity regularization.

Result: NINRF effectively reconstructs dynamic PET images, providing continuous representations of geometric features and concentration variations, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: NINRF successfully combines NMF with continuous functions via neural networks, offering a robust solution for dynamic PET reconstruction with noise.

Abstract: The reconstruction of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images from
noisy projection data is a significant but challenging problem. In this paper,
we introduce an unsupervised learning approach, Non-negative Implicit Neural
Representation Factorization (\texttt{NINRF}), based on low rank matrix
factorization of unknown images and employing neural networks to represent both
coefficients and bases. Mathematically, we demonstrate that if a sequence of
dynamic PET images satisfies a generalized non-negative low-rank property, it
can be decomposed into a set of non-negative continuous functions varying in
the temporal-spatial domain. This bridges the well-established non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) with continuous functions and we propose using
implicit neural representations (INRs) to connect matrix with continuous
functions. The neural network parameters are obtained by minimizing the KL
divergence, with additional sparsity regularization on coefficients and bases.
Extensive experiments on dynamic PET reconstruction with Poisson noise
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods,
while giving continuous representations for object's detailed geometric
features and regional concentration variation.

*Junjie Chen, Yuecong Xu, Haosheng Li, Kemi Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses robustness issues in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), proposing a tripartite framework to improve resilience against real-world perturbations and adversarial distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PCSS-UDA methods lack robustness to real-world perturbations and adversarial distortions, limiting their practical application.

Method: The proposed framework includes: 1) a robustness evaluation model, 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM), and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning.

Result: Experiments show a maximum mIoU improvement of 14.3% under adversarial attack.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances PCSS-UDA robustness by addressing feature overlap and structure erosion.

Abstract: 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) is a cornerstone for
environmental perception in robotic systems and autonomous driving, enabling
precise scene understanding through point-wise classification. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing
methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world
perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work
first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA
robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in
shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by
domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address
the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a
robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial
attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention
alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving
discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a
contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that
progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more
discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
SynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of
14.3\% under adversarial attack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline to improve anime video generation by leveraging human feedback, introducing a multi-dimensional reward dataset (AnimeReward) and a novel training method (GAPO) for better alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models for real-world videos fail to address the unique challenges of anime, such as motion distortion and flickering artifacts.

Method: The authors construct a 30k human-annotated dataset (AnimeReward) and develop GAPO, a training method incorporating preference gaps for optimization.

Result: AnimeReward outperforms existing models, and GAPO enhances alignment in benchmarks and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively improves anime video quality, with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: Anime video generation faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
anime data and unusual motion patterns, leading to issues such as motion
distortion and flickering artifacts, which result in misalignment with human
preferences. Existing reward models, designed primarily for real-world videos,
fail to capture the unique appearance and consistency requirements of anime. In
this work, we propose a pipeline to enhance anime video generation by
leveraging human feedback for better alignment. Specifically, we construct the
first multi-dimensional reward dataset for anime videos, comprising 30k
human-annotated samples that incorporating human preferences for both visual
appearance and visual consistency. Based on this, we develop AnimeReward, a
powerful reward model that employs specialized vision-language models for
different evaluation dimensions to guide preference alignment. Furthermore, we
introduce Gap-Aware Preference Optimization (GAPO), a novel training method
that explicitly incorporates preference gaps into the optimization process,
enhancing alignment performance and efficiency. Extensive experiment results
show that AnimeReward outperforms existing reward models, and the inclusion of
GAPO leads to superior alignment in both quantitative benchmarks and human
evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing anime
video quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

*Zhuo He, Paul Henderson, Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel physics-based neural deferred shading pipeline decomposes rendering for better control over illumination and material parameters, outperforming classical and neural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning rendering lacks control over illumination and material parameters, limiting scene reconstruction.

Method: Proposes a neural deferred shading pipeline with a shadow estimator for decomposing and generalizing shading.

Result: Outperforms classical and state-of-the-art neural models, enabling photo-realistic shading from arbitrary illumination.

Conclusion: The method advances rendering by enabling control and generalization in photo-realistic shading.

Abstract: Deep learning based rendering has achieved major improvements in
photo-realistic image synthesis, with potential applications including visual
effects in movies and photo-realistic scene building in video games. However, a
significant limitation is the difficulty of decomposing the illumination and
material parameters, which limits such methods to reconstructing an input
scene, without any possibility to control these parameters. This paper
introduces a novel physics based neural deferred shading pipeline to decompose
the data-driven rendering process, learn a generalizable shading function to
produce photo-realistic results for shading and relighting tasks; we also
propose a shadow estimator to efficiently mimic shadowing effects. Our model
achieves improved performance compared to classical models and a state-of-art
neural shading model, and enables generalizable photo-realistic shading from
arbitrary illumination input.

TL;DR: STSUN is a unified network for remote sensing that adapts to diverse spatial, temporal, and spectral inputs, unifying dense prediction tasks and semantic class predictions without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for remote sensing are rigid, requiring task-specific architectures and retraining for new classes, limiting adaptability to heterogeneous data.

Method: STSUN leverages metadata for unified representation, uses trainable task embeddings for dense prediction tasks, and integrates category embeddings for flexible semantic class prediction.

Result: STSUN achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets and scenarios, demonstrating adaptability and generalizability.

Conclusion: STSUN overcomes limitations of rigid architectures, offering a robust and flexible solution for complex remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the
development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges
in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for
remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed
input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the
heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world
data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among
semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection,
necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders.
This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic
classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified
Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data
with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by
leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies
disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning
the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible
prediction across any set of semantic categories by integrating trainable
category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
with diverse STS configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single
STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying
various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The
proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores super-resolution limits using imaging constraints, proposing a method leveraging motion blur and convex optimization to achieve large resolution increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional super-resolution methods face theoretical and practical limits, often restricted to small resolution improvements. Motion blur is typically seen as a hindrance.

Method: The approach combines high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and convex optimization, including deconvolution with a box for sparse signals.

Result: Perfect reconstructions of sparse signals are achieved, and motion blur is shown to aid super-resolution. Pseudo-random motion enables high-resolution reconstruction from a single low-resolution image.

Conclusion: The method successfully overcomes traditional super-resolution limits, demonstrating practical applications with simulated and real data.

Abstract: We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to
various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods
have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition,
motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We
show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and
convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A
key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general,
convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect
reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that
motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using
pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target
using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with
simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a
computer controlled stage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAP improves rare concept generation in diffusion models by treating it as navigating a latent causal path, using frequent prompts and dynamic prompt switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with rare concept generation due to infrequent training data. RAP addresses this by leveraging frequent prompts and aligning with model dynamics.

Method: RAP uses frequent prompts to approximate rare ones, formulates prompt switching dynamically, and treats alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism.

Result: RAP outperforms baselines in rare concept generation across diverse diffusion models, validated by automated and human evaluations.

Conclusion: RAP provides a principled, model-aligned approach for enhancing rare concept synthesis in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in high-fidelity image
generation but often falter when synthesizing rare concepts, i.e., prompts that
are infrequently observed in the training distribution. In this paper, we
introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as
navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory
through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather
than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that
rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent
prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score
similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret
prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth
semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens,
we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics.
Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP
consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines
in both automated evaluations and human studies.

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative models for scene understanding by treating it as an inverse generative modeling problem, enabling robust generalization to new scenes and objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend generative models beyond synthesis to understand scene properties from natural images.

Method: Formulates scene understanding as inverse generative modeling, using compositional models for inference on unseen scenes.

Result: Enables robust generalization to new scenes with more objects and shapes, and zero-shot multi-object perception.

Conclusion: The approach successfully infers scene structure and properties, applicable to pretrained models for zero-shot tasks.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity visual content. In this work, we explore how generative models
can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to
understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene
understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find
conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural
image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images
substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to
build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over
pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set
of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with
an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this
enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust
generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be
directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for
zero-shot multi-object perception. Code and visualizations are at

TL;DR: RRCA-Net, a novel CNN-based method, uses reusable-convolution blocks and dual interactive attention for efficient infrared small target detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to targets being small, dim, and shapeless. Existing CNN-based methods are effective but computationally heavy.

Method: Proposes RRCA-Net with reusable-convolution blocks (RuCB) for iterative refinement and a dual interactive attention module (DIAAM) for feature fusion. Uses a target-inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) for steady convergence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) with fewer parameters and can enhance other IRSTD methods.

Conclusion: RRCA-Net is efficient, effective, and versatile, offering a plug-and-play solution for infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique
characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently
published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy
feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective
detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network
(RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net
incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without
introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in
RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be
well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention
aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and
fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve
high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual
information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence,
we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by
integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate
that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and
play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular
IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/

Motivation: To investigate if embodied 3D grounding benefits from detection models, given that detection models outperform grounding models without instruction-specific training.

Method: Proposes DEGround, a framework using DETR queries for both detection and grounding, with regional activation and query-wise modulation modules for better context-aware understanding.

Result: DEGround outperforms BIP3D by 7.52% in accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: DEGround demonstrates the potential of unifying detection and grounding tasks, improving performance in embodied 3D grounding.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

*Hanoona Rasheed, Abdelrahman Shaker, Anqi Tang, Muhammad Maaz, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMathQA is a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to perform cross-modal mathematical reasoning in videos, covering diverse domains and requiring integration of visual, audio, and textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in videos is complex due to multimodal, temporally dispersed information, requiring selective integration of contextual details. Existing methods lack evaluation frameworks for such challenges.

Method: Introduces VideoMathQA, a benchmark with 10 mathematical domains, expert-annotated questions, and three reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension.

Result: The benchmark highlights limitations of current approaches and provides a systematic evaluation framework for cross-modal reasoning in videos.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA establishes a foundation for advancing models that reason across rich, temporally extended multimodal mathematical problem settings.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

### [196] [Improving Out-of-Distribution Detection via Dynamic Covariance Calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09399)
*Kaiyu Guo, Zijian Wang, Tan Pan, Brian C. Lovell, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dynamic approach improves OOD detection by adjusting prior geometry in real-time, outperforming static subspace-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static subspace-based OOD detection methods fail due to geometry distortion from ill-distributed samples, necessitating dynamic correction.

Method: Dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features, refining geometry while preserving essential data characteristics.

Result: Significantly enhances OOD detection across multiple pre-trained models on CIFAR and ImageNet-1k datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment of prior geometry effectively addresses limitations of static methods, improving OOD detection robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

*Chenjian Gao, Lihe Ding, Xin Cai, Zhanpeng Huang, Zibin Wang, Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mask-based LoRA tuning method is proposed for flexible video editing using pretrained I2V models, preserving backgrounds while enabling controllable edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods lack flexibility for specific edits and rely on large-scale pretraining. First-frame-guided editing is limited in controlling subsequent frames.

Method: The approach uses mask-based LoRA tuning to adapt pretrained I2V models, incorporating additional references for guidance and spatial masks for region-specific learning.

Result: The method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed solution offers efficient, adaptable video editing without altering model architecture, addressing flexibility and control challenges.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [198] [SycnMapV2: Robust and Adaptive Unsupervised Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16297)
*Heng Zhang, Zikang Wan, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncMapV2 achieves unsupervised segmentation with unmatched robustness, outperforming SOTA methods under various corruptions without robust training or supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human vision's robustness to noise contrasts with AI's struggles, inspiring the development of SyncMapV2 for unsupervised, adaptive segmentation.

Method: SyncMapV2 uses self-organizing dynamical equations and random network concepts, adapting online without re-initialization.

Result: SyncMapV2 shows minimal mIoU drop (0.01%) vs. SOTA (23.8%), excelling in noise, weather, and blur conditions.

Conclusion: SyncMapV2 pioneers adaptive, robust AI, mimicking human vision's continuous adaptability with near-zero degradation.

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods. This superior performance extends across various
types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur
(7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust
training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm
that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from
random networks. Moreover, unlike conventional methods that require
re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the
continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and
robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above
online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests,
SyncMapV2 demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and
fosters a new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near
future.

*Hanz Cuevas-Velasquez, Anastasios Yiannakidis, Soyong Shin, Giorgio Becherini, Markus Höschle, Joachim Tesch, Taylor Obersat, Tsvetelina Alexiadis, Michael J. Black*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAMMA is a markerless motion-capture pipeline for two-person interactions, using dense 2D landmarks and segmentation masks to handle occlusions, outperforming existing methods and matching marker-based systems without manual cleanup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional marker-based systems are costly and time-consuming, while learning-based methods struggle with occlusions and interactions. MAMMA aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Predicts dense 2D surface landmarks using segmentation masks and a novel architecture with learnable queries. Trained on a synthetic multi-view dataset with extreme poses and interactions.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy compared to marker-based systems, handles complex interactions, and avoids manual cleanup.

Conclusion: MAMMA provides a robust, markerless solution for motion capture, with released dataset, benchmark, and code for research.

Abstract: We present MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately
recovers SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interaction
sequences. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers.
Although they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware,
manual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and
time-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these
limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse
keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work,
we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on
segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even
under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable
queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex
person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods.
To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset
combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand
motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic
sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X
ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system
capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach
offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based
motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we
address the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and
markerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from
real multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method,
training code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes.

### [200] [Pro-AD: Learning Comprehensive Prototypes with Prototype-based Constraint for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13097)
*Ziqing Zhou, Yurui Pan, Lidong Wang, Wenbing Zhu, Mingmin Chi, Dong Wu, Bo Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pro-AD improves unsupervised anomaly detection by expanding prototypes and using a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder to enhance normal information aggregation and reconstruction, while preventing anomaly reconstruction via a Prototype-based Constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods inadequately aggregate normal information and risk reconstructing anomalies due to the 'Soft Identity Mapping' problem.

Method: Introduces expanded prototypes and a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder for better normal information aggregation and reconstruction, plus a Prototype-based Constraint to block anomaly reconstruction.

Result: Pro-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pro-AD effectively addresses limitations of prototype-based methods, demonstrating superior robustness and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection
utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates
insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction.
However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well
reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft
Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these
issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly
detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable
prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we
employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the
normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via
prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more
comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image
features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its
contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive
prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well
reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention
mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within
the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further
improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness
for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

*Matt Poyser, Toby P. Breckon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDS-NAS speeds up Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by 27x using dynamic hard example mining and curriculum learning, without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability challenges in NAS by improving training efficiency.

Method: Uses autoencoder for image similarity embedding, kd-tree for ordering images by dissimilarity, and curriculum learning to dynamically update subsample datasets.

Result: Achieves up to 27x speedup in gradient-based NAS without performance degradation.

Conclusion: DDS-NAS reduces training time and iterations by maximizing sample contribution.

Abstract: In order to address the scalability challenge within Neural Architecture
Search (NAS), we speed up NAS training via dynamic hard example mining within a
curriculum learning framework. By utilizing an autoencoder that enforces an
image similarity embedding in latent space, we construct an efficient kd-tree
structure to order images by furthest neighbour dissimilarity in a
low-dimensional embedding. From a given query image from our subsample dataset,
we can identify the most dissimilar image within the global dataset in
logarithmic time. Via curriculum learning, we then dynamically re-formulate an
unbiased subsample dataset for NAS optimisation, upon which the current NAS
solution architecture performs poorly. We show that our DDS-NAS framework
speeds up gradient-based NAS strategies by up to 27x without loss in
performance. By maximising the contribution of each image sample during
training, we reduce the duration of a NAS training cycle and the number of
iterations required for convergence.

*Xuelin Shen, Jiayin Xu, Kangsheng Yin, Wenhan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), a method to protect images from exploitation by vision-language models while maintaining compression functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard user privacy against advanced vision-language models that can exploit publicly posted images.

Method: Introduces PSIC with a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation module and Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented optimization, enabling flexible decoding options.

Result: Effective protection against VLP models while preserving image quality and compression functionality.

Conclusion: PSIC is a plug-and-play solution that enhances privacy without compromising image utility.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

TL;DR: FMF-SLAM is an efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method using FFT and novel attention mechanisms to improve performance in noisy, dark, or varying lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual SLAM struggles in noisy, dark, or varying lighting environments, and traditional methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes FMF-SLAM with Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention for RGB/depth feature extraction, multi-scale knowledge distillation, and integration with GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.

Result: Validated on TUM, TartanAir, and real-world datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: FMF-SLAM is practical, efficient, and performs well in real-world scenarios, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our
real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,
varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RA-NeRF improves camera pose estimation for 3D reconstruction by combining NeRF with flow-driven pose regulation and an implicit pose filter, outperforming existing methods on complex trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction and SLAM rely on accurate camera pose priors and struggle with complex trajectories, limiting their performance.

Method: RA-NeRF integrates NeRF with photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation, and an implicit pose filter to enhance pose accuracy and robustness.

Result: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and visual quality on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF is effective and robust for scene reconstruction under complex camera trajectories, advancing the field of 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

*Yong Liu, SongLi Wu, Sule Bai, Jiahao Wang, Yitong Wang, Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenBench, a new benchmark for open-vocabulary segmentation, and proposes OVSNet, a method improving segmentation performance for diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to measure models' comprehension of truly open-vocabulary concepts due to semantic overlap with training data.

Method: Proposes OVSNet, which fuses heterogeneous features and expands the training space cost-free.

Result: OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing datasets and OpenBench.

Conclusion: OpenBench and OVSNet effectively address limitations in evaluating and improving open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCoOp is a federated learning framework for vision-language models that improves robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts by using global, local, and OOD prompts, addressing data heterogeneity and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning (FPL) approaches struggle with balancing performance and robustness, especially under OOD shifts, due to data heterogeneity among clients.

Method: FOCoOp uses ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts to create class- and distribution-level separations, optimized via bi-level distributionally robust optimization and semi-unbalanced optimal transport.

Result: Experiments show FOCoOp effectively handles decentralized heterogeneous distributions and improves robustness to OOD shifts.

Conclusion: FOCoOp successfully addresses the trade-off between performance and robustness in federated learning, enhancing reliability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

TL;DR: A high-resolution dataset of soil samples is presented to train CNNs for optical grain size analysis, reducing downtime and costs of traditional PSD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PSD analyses are costly and time-consuming; optical grain size analysis integrated into workflows could mitigate these issues.

Method: 12,714 images of 321 soil samples were captured in standardized conditions (45 MP resolution, 39.4 µm/pixel) in moist and dry states, using a custom test bench and coning/quartering for larger samples.

Result: A robust dataset for training CNNs in geotechnical applications was created.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a foundation for advancing optical grain size analysis in geotechnical workflows.

Abstract: Traditional particle size distribution (PSD) analyses create significant
downtime and are expensive in labor and maintenance. These drawbacks could be
alleviated using optical grain size analysis integrated into routine
geotechnical laboratory workflow. This paper presents a high-resolution dataset
of 12,714 images of 321 different soil samples collected in the Montreal,
Quebec region, alongside their PSD analysis. It is designed to provide a robust
starting point for training convolutional neural networks (CNN) in geotechnical
applications. Soil samples were photographed in a standardized top-view
position with a resolution of 45 MP and a minimum scale of 39.4 micrometers per
pixel, both in their moist and dry states. A custom test bench employing 13x9
inch white aluminum trays, on which the samples are spread in a thin layer, was
used. For samples exceeding a size limit, a coning and quartering method was
employed for mass reduction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces REIR, a task combining instance-level retrieval and localization, and proposes REIRCOCO benchmark and CLARE method for it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tasks (TIR and REC) lack precision or scalability for real-world scenarios requiring both retrieval and localization.

Method: Proposes CLARE with a dual-stream architecture and MORE module, integrating object detection, REC pretraining, and CLIA for end-to-end optimization.

Result: CLARE achieves state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC.

Conclusion: REIR addresses a critical gap, and CLARE proves effective and versatile for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

TL;DR: A novel framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improves sound source localization by distinguishing sound-making objects from silent ones with new loss functions (OCA and ORI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in complex scenes due to reliance on simple audio-visual correspondence, missing fine-grained semantic differences.

Method: Proposes a framework leveraging MLLMs for detailed contextual info and introduces OCA and ORI loss functions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets in single- and multi-source scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations of current methods by integrating detailed contextual info and novel loss functions.

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated

*Pietro Bonazzi, Nicola Farronato, Stefan Zihlmann, Haotong Qin, Michele Magno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PicoSAM2 is a lightweight, promptable segmentation model for edge and in-sensor execution, achieving high efficiency and performance on COCO and LVIS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time, privacy-aware segmentation for latency-sensitive applications like smart glasses and IoT devices.

Method: Uses a depthwise separable U-Net with knowledge distillation and fixed-point prompt encoding, learning from SAM2.

Result: Achieves 51.9% mIoU on COCO and 44.9% on LVIS, with a quantized model running at 14.3 ms on IMX500. Distillation improves LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of efficient, on-camera segmentation, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud processing.

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and
privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce
PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation
model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and
fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).
On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized
model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it
the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible
directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host
processing.

TL;DR: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover surface normals under arbitrary lighting, but challenges like illumination-normal coupling and detail preservation persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity in observed intensity due to lighting changes and the difficulty in preserving high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces.

Method: Not explicitly mentioned, but likely involves advanced techniques to decouple illumination and normal features while capturing intricate geometries.

Result: Not explicitly stated, but the goal is high-quality normal recovery under arbitrary lighting.

Conclusion: Universal PS faces challenges in illumination-normal coupling and detail preservation, requiring further innovation.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

TL;DR: Autonomous agents in tribes use communication signals to coordinate and improve collective efficiency, developing a shared culture through learning. The study explores how communication strategies and social structures like hierarchies impact cooperation and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous agents can develop a shared culture through communication and learning, and how this culture influences their collective efficiency and cooperation.

Method: The NEC-DAC system is used, where each agent has a neural network for decision-making. The study analyzes communication strategies, social structures (e.g., authority hierarchies), and the transmission of culture across generations.

Result: Culture of cooperation significantly impacts tribe performance. Communication signals facilitate culture emergence and transmission. Coordinated behavior and signaling within neural networks enhance efficiency.

Conclusion: Communication and learning enable autonomous agents to develop a shared culture, improving collective efficiency and cooperation, with social structures playing a key role in performance.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [213] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores strategic randomization in LLMs using a zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, evaluating five LLMs' ability to randomize decisions under different prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic randomization is underexplored in LLMs, and prior work conflates cognitive decision-making with mechanical randomness generation.

Method: A novel zero-sum game with a Nash equilibrium of maximal entropy is used. LLMs are evaluated across framed, neutral, and hinted prompts in competitive gameplay.

Result: Weaker models remain deterministic, while stronger models randomize more under hints. Strong LLMs exploit weaker models but converge to equilibrium with peers.

Conclusion: The study reveals variations in LLMs' strategic reasoning, suggesting room for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning.

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [214] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan, Subha Madhavan, Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques Shojaee et al.'s (2025) conclusion about reasoning models' limitations, arguing it's due to experimental constraints, not cognitive boundaries. It shows tool-enabled models can surpass the 'reasoning cliff.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the idea that reasoning models have intrinsic scaling limits, highlighting the role of system-level constraints in their performance.

Method: Empirical demonstration using tool-enabled models (e.g., o4-mini, GPT-4o) to solve problems beyond the 'reasoning cliff.'

Result: Tool-enabled models solve problems previously deemed impossible, revealing a hierarchy of agentic reasoning.

Conclusion: The 'reasoning cliff' is an artifact of restrictive interfaces, not a cognitive limit, reshaping how machine intelligence is measured.

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TabPFN, a foundation model for tabular data, is applied to sub-national crop yield forecasting in South Africa, showing comparable accuracy to ML models but with faster tuning and less feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of TabPFN for sub-national yield forecasting using Earth Observation and weather data, comparing it to traditional ML models.

Method: Used dekadal EO and weather data, aggregated monthly, to forecast crop yields. Benchmarked TabPFN against six ML and three baseline models using leave-one-year-out cross-validation.

Result: TabPFN and ML models had similar accuracy, outperforming baselines. TabPFN offered faster tuning and less feature engineering.

Conclusion: TabPFN is more practical for real-world yield forecasting due to its efficiency and ease of use.

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

*Fien van Wetten, Aske Plaat, Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to play Baba is You, a puzzle game requiring language and reasoning. Larger models like GPT-4o perform better, while smaller ones struggle. Finetuning helps level analysis but not solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reasoning and language abilities through a game involving dynamic rule manipulation.

Method: Six LLMs were tested with three prompt types, and two models (Mistral, OLMo) were finetuned using game data.

Result: Larger models outperformed smaller ones; finetuning improved level analysis but not solution formulation.

Conclusion: LLMs, even state-of-the-art or finetuned, struggle with dynamic rule reasoning, highlighting challenges in complex problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GITes, a framework combining spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita with GPT-4o to improve emotional support, showing significant improvements in NLP and spiritual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mental health support systems lack depth in addressing emotional needs, prompting the integration of spiritual guidance for enhanced well-being.

Method: The study enhances the ExTES dataset with spiritually guided responses, benchmarks 12 LLMs, and introduces a Spiritual Insight metric for evaluation.

Result: Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct showed improvements of up to 126.53% in metrics like ROUGE and Spiritual Insight compared to zero-shot models.

Conclusion: AI systems with spiritual guidance show promise for better emotional support, though real-world validation is needed. The dataset and code will be public.

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for AI systems with probabilistic agents competing and updating beliefs via Bayesian methods, ensuring truth as an evolutionary attractor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a mathematically rigorous AI system where truth emerges from structured competition and belief revision among agents.

Method: Uses Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics. Agents compete, update beliefs, and reproduce based on alignment with an oracle. Cryptographic identities and causal inference ensure traceability and robustness.

Result: Formal theorems prove convergence, robustness, and evolutionary stability, showing truth as an attractor in the system.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates that verifiable knowledge emerges from adversarial competition within a computable, self-regulating swarm.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

*Shuyin Xia, Guan Wang, Gaojie Xu, Sen Zhao, Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GBGC, a multi-granularity graph coarsening method using granular-ball computing, improving efficiency and accuracy over spectrum-preserving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph coarsening methods focus on spectrum-preserving but ignore multi-granularity subregions, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: GBGC adaptively splits the graph into granular-balls of optimal granularity, using them as supernodes for coarsening.

Result: GBGC is faster (10-100x speedup) and more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, with lower time complexity.

Conclusion: GBGC's robustness and efficiency make it a promising standard for graph data preprocessing.

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

*Baochang Ren, Shuofei Qiao, Wenhao Yu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowRL integrates factuality rewards into RL training to reduce hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs while preserving reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing severe hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs due to unclear knowledge boundaries and lack of factual supervision in RL.

Method: Proposes Knowledge-enhanced RL (KnowRL), adding factuality rewards based on knowledge verification to guide fact-based reasoning.

Result: KnowRL reduces hallucinations on three datasets and maintains reasoning performance on two others.

Conclusion: KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations without compromising reasoning, offering a reliable solution for slow-thinking models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecLLM-R1 is a novel recommendation framework using LLMs to address filter bubbles and optimize business policies through a two-stage training process, outperforming baselines in accuracy, diversity, and novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations like filter bubbles, underutilized external knowledge, and misalignment between model optimization and business policies in traditional recommendation systems.

Method: Uses LLMs with a two-stage training: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for basic recommendation skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for multi-step reasoning and reward-based optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy, diversity, and novelty on a real-world dataset, reducing filter bubbles and aligning with business goals.

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1 effectively integrates recommendation models and policies, offering a robust solution for complex business objectives.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating emotion detection into calendar apps using biometric (ECG) and behavioral (computer activity) methods, finding the latter more consistent and accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance productivity and engagement in HCI by dynamically adapting interfaces to users' emotional states.

Method: Two approaches: biometric (ECG signals processed via LSTM/GRU) and behavioral (machine learning on user interactions).

Result: Behavioral method outperformed, with 90% accuracy for mouse interactions; GRU networks achieved 84.38% accuracy for Valence prediction.

Conclusion: Behavioral emotion detection is more effective, offering potential for adaptive user interfaces.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal control at intersections, showing improved efficiency over traditional fixed-time systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban traffic congestion at intersections affects travel time, fuel use, and emissions, and fixed-time systems fail to adapt to dynamic traffic.

Method: A decentralized MARL controller was tested in a Pygame-simulated network of intersections with random vehicle flows, comparing performance to fixed-time control.

Result: MARL reduced average wait times and improved throughput significantly compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: MARL shows promise for urban traffic management, though scalability and real-world implementation need further research.

Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly
impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time
signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic
patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across
multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a
simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections
with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability.
A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal
operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations
and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a
baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time
and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically
significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved
throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies
hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency.
More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world
implementation challenges.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated data-curation pipeline for software engineering (SWE) datasets, scaling volume and diversity. The Skywork-SWE model, trained on this data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving with data size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data curation in SWE is time-consuming, limiting dataset size and diversity. The paper aims to automate this process to enhance LLM capabilities in SWE.

Method: Proposes an incremental, automated pipeline for curating SWE datasets, including 10,169 Python task instances with runtime validation. Fine-tunes the Skywork-SWE model on this data.

Result: Skywork-SWE achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on SWE-bench, improving to 47.0% with test-time scaling, setting a new SOTA for sub-32B models.

Conclusion: Automated data curation and scaling techniques significantly improve LLM performance in SWE, with potential for further advancements.

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

### [225] [FEAT: A Preference Feedback Dataset through a Cost-Effective Auto-Generation and Labeling Framework for English AI Tutoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19325)
*Hyein Seo, Taewook Hwang, Yohan Lee, sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEAT is a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback in English education, using three datasets (DM, DG, DA) to balance quality and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI tutoring systems need high-quality teacher feedback data, but manual generation is costly and time-consuming.

Method: Proposed FEAT framework with three datasets: DM (human-LLM collaboration), DG (LLM-only), and DA (DG augmented with DM).

Result: Adding 5-10% DM to DG outperforms using 100% DM alone.

Conclusion: FEAT offers a scalable and cost-efficient solution for generating teacher feedback.

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a search-based method for repairing non-functional game levels, combining evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, and integrates it with PCGML for hybrid procedural content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of repairing designed but non-functional game levels while minimizing changes, ensuring completeness, reachability, and performance.

Method: Uses evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms for level repair, applied to levels generated by a PCGML method.

Result: The hybrid approach of PCGML for generation and search-based repair shows promising results.

Conclusion: The combination of PCGML and search-based repair is effective for hybrid procedural content generation in games.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

### [227] [Conversational Intent-Driven GraphRAG: Enhancing Multi-Turn Dialogue Systems through Adaptive Dual-Retrieval of Flow Patterns and Context Semantics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19385)
*Ziqi Zhu, Tao Hu, Honglong Zhang, Dan Yang, HanGeng Chen, Mengran Zhang, Xilun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG improves multi-turn dialogue systems by combining intent-based graph traversal with semantic search, outperforming traditional RAG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing dialogue systems in maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression.

Method: Constructs dynamic intent transition graphs and uses a dual-retrieval mechanism balancing intent and semantic search.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 11% BLEU, 5% ROUGE-L, 6% METEOR, and 58% response quality improvement.

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG effectively integrates intent and semantic retrieval for better dialogue performance.

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

*Alexandre Chapin, Emmanuel Dellandrea, Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Object-centric representation (OCR) is evaluated in robotic manipulation tasks, showing better generalization than holistic methods in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess OCR's potential beyond scene decomposition, especially in multi-object robotic tasks with high randomization.

Method: Created simulated robotic tasks with multiple objects and randomization, comparing OCR against holistic representations.

Result: OCR outperforms holistic methods in complex scenarios, proving its robustness.

Conclusion: OCR is promising for tasks requiring reasoning over structured representations, despite challenges in complex scenes.

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with dataset diversity and domain shift, limiting their effectiveness in unsupervised sitting posture identification.

Conclusion: U-DaDiL is a promising solution for domain shift and robust clustering in unsupervised sitting posture identification.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach, Unsupervised Dataset Dictionary
Learning (U-DaDiL), for totally unsupervised robust clustering applied to
sitting posture identification. Traditional methods often lack adaptability to
diverse datasets and suffer from domain shift issues. U-DaDiL addresses these
challenges by aligning distributions from different datasets using Wasserstein

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commander-GPT, a modular framework using specialized LLM agents and centralized commanders, improves sarcasm understanding by 4.4-11.7% over SoTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with sarcasm understanding despite their success in other NLP tasks, prompting the need for a specialized framework.

Method: Proposes Commander-GPT, a modular system with specialized LLM agents for sub-tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis) and three types of commanders (lightweight, autoregressive, large LLMs) for coordination.

Result: Achieves 4.4% and 11.7% F1 score improvements on MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks over SoTA baselines.

Conclusion: Commander-GPT effectively addresses sarcasm understanding by leveraging modular decision routing and specialized agents.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome traditional RAG's issues like retrieval drift, redundancy, and rigidity in complex reasoning tasks.

framework addresses key limitations of traditional RAG, such as retrieval
drift, information redundancy, and strategy rigidity. Key innovations include
the RAG-driven Reasoning Alignment (RDRA) mechanism, the Search-Think Iterative
Enhancement (STIE) mechanism, the Network-Local Intelligent Routing (NLR)
mechanism, and a progressive hybrid training strategy. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in exact match (EM) and LLM-judged score
(LJ) across four benchmarks, highlighting the framework's robustness and

### [232] [NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Dependency Graphs for Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19500)
*Yan Jiang, Hao Zhou, LiZhong GU, Ai Han, TianLong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NaviAgent introduces a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling in LLMs, outperforming baselines in task success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with static knowledge and fragile tool invocation, hindering complex toolchain orchestration. Existing methods lack robustness and scalability.

Method: NaviAgent uses a Multi-Path Decider for dynamic action selection and a Graph-Encoded Navigator with a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG) for efficient toolchain planning.

Result: NaviAgent achieves higher task success rates (TSR) than baselines (ReAct, ToolLLM, α-UMI) by 13.5% to 19.0% and maintains efficiency. Fine-tuned models and TDHG further boost performance.

Conclusion: NaviAgent's architecture significantly improves toolchain orchestration, balancing quality and efficiency, with the Graph-Encoded Navigator playing a key role in complex tasks.

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

*Carlo Romeo, Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NTRL automates D&D combat encounter balancing using reinforcement learning, outperforming manual DM methods by increasing combat longevity and strategic depth while maintaining fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual balancing of D&D combat encounters is complex and disrupts narrative flow, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: NTRL uses a contextual bandit approach to dynamically adjust difficulty based on real-time party attributes.

Result: NTRL extends combat longevity (+200%), reduces post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and enhances tactical play while ensuring high win rates (70%).

Conclusion: NTRL outperforms human DMs by optimizing combat encounters for strategic depth and fairness.

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining ASP-derived rules with black-box ML improves accuracy and interpretability in medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing ML models lack interpretability, while symbolic methods like ASP lack predictive power. A hybrid solution is needed.

Method: Integrates FOLD-R++ ASP-derived rules with black-box ML classifiers to correct uncertain predictions and provide explanations.

Result: Significant gains in accuracy and F1 score on five medical datasets.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with ML enhances interpretability without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving complex tasks without manually defined environment models by leveraging LLMs and symbolic planning.

Method: Uses specialized LLM-based agents for collaborative domain model generation and adaptation, ReAct-style execution, and natural language plan translation.

Result: Achieves strong performance in benchmark planning domains and the VirtualHome simulated environment.

Conclusion: TAPAS effectively integrates LLMs and symbolic planning for adaptive task-solving without manual redefinition.

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

*Zhiyuan Wang, Bokui Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChordPrompt, a framework for continual learning in vision-language models, addressing limitations in existing methods by using cross-modal prompts and domain-adaptive text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods lack strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning and neglect cross-modal information exchange, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ChordPrompt employs cross-modal prompts for visual-textual interaction and domain-adaptive text prompts for multi-domain continual adaptation.

Result: ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance on multi-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChordPrompt enhances continual learning in vision-language models by harmonizing visual and textual prompts, improving adaptability across domains.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs), a framework integrating cognitive and embodied AI to overcome limitations in scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems and automated labs lack flexibility and autonomy for adaptive hypothesis testing in the physical world.

Method: ISLs combine foundation models, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for closed-loop, autonomous experimentation.

Result: The framework promises iterative, autonomous experimentation and potential serendipitous discoveries.

Conclusion: ISLs are essential for advancing AI-driven science and overcoming current discovery limitations.

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

### [238] [Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs over DMGs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19650)
*Simon Ferreira, Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends the do-calculus to cyclic causal systems, proving its soundness and completeness for identifying macro causal effects in cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs) over directed mixed graphs (DMGs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often involve cyclic causal dynamics, but existing tools like ADMGs and C-DMGs over ADMGs are limited. This work addresses the need for methods to handle cyclic structures.

Method: The paper generalizes structural causal models (SCMs) to input-output SCMs (ioSCMs) to allow cycles, then applies the do-calculus to C-DMGs over DMGs.

Result: The do-calculus is unconditionally sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs. Graphical criteria for non-identifiability also extend to a subset of these graphs.

Conclusion: The findings expand the applicability of the do-calculus to cyclic causal systems, providing a robust framework for macro-level causal inference.

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

### [239] [From memories to maps: Mechanisms of in context reinforcement learning in transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19686)
*Ching Fang, Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how episodic memory-like mechanisms in transformers enable rapid adaptation in reinforcement learning, resembling natural cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and animals learn efficiently with minimal experience, contrasting with standard reinforcement learning methods.

Method: Training a transformer on in-context reinforcement learning tasks inspired by rodent behavior and analyzing the emergent learning algorithms.

Result: The model uses memory tokens to cache computations, resembling hippocampal-entorhinal brain systems, and develops non-standard reinforcement learning strategies.

Conclusion: Memory serves as a computational resource for flexible behavior, offering insights into rapid adaptation in both artificial and natural systems.

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

### [240] [Toward Decision-Oriented Prognostics: An Integrated Estimate-Optimize Framework for Predictive Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19698)
*Zhuojun Xie, Adam Abdin, Yiping Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework for predictive maintenance (PdM) to address suboptimal decisions caused by prediction errors in traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) methods. It shows improved robustness and decision quality, reducing maintenance regret by up to 22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty in ML models limits industrial adoption of PdM. The study aims to improve decision-making by aligning predictive models with maintenance outcomes.

Method: The IEO framework jointly tunes predictive models while optimizing maintenance decisions, using a stochastic perturbation gradient descent algorithm for small datasets.

Result: Empirical results show IEO reduces maintenance regret by up to 22% compared to ETO, improving robustness and decision quality.

Conclusion: The IEO framework provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in PdM, enhancing reliability in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

*Lei Kang, Xuanshuo Fu, Oriol Ramos Terrades, Javier Vazquez-Corral, Ernest Valveny, Dimosthenis Karatzas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving medical document analysis platform using fine-tuned LLaMA-v3 for differential diagnosis, outperforming existing methods with explainable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and improve accuracy in differential diagnosis using unstructured medical records.

Method: Fine-tunes LLaMA-v3 with low-rank adaptation on the DDXPlus dataset for differential diagnosis tasks.

Result: Superior performance in pathology prediction and variable-length differential diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The platform offers reliable, explainable, and privacy-preserving AI for clinical use, advancing medical document analysis.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis
for real-world healthcare applications. The code can be found at

### [242] [From Reproduction to Replication: Evaluating Research Agents with Progressive Code Masking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19724)
*Gyeongwon James Kim, Alex Wilf, Louis-Philippe Morency, Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoExperiment is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to implement and run ML experiments from research papers, scaling difficulty by masking code functions. Performance drops as task complexity increases, highlighting challenges in code generation and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack evaluation of AI agents' ability to implement scientific ideas with varying code starting points, from reproduction to full replication.

Method: Agents are given a research paper, a codebase with masked functions, and a command to run the experiment. They must generate missing code, execute it, and reproduce results, with difficulty scaling by the number of masked functions.

Result: Performance degrades as task complexity increases. Interactive agents outperform static ones, and multi-trial success rates are higher than single-shot.

Conclusion: AutoExperiment addresses critical challenges in AI-driven scientific experimentation and serves as a benchmark for progress in autonomous code generation and execution.

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

### [243] [Automatic Prompt Optimization for Knowledge Graph Construction: Insights from an Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19773)
*Nandana Mihindukulasooriya, Niharika S. D'Souza, Faisal Chowdhury, Horst Samulowitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores automatic prompt optimization for triple extraction in KG construction, showing it can generate human-like prompts and improve results, especially with complex schemas and larger texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handcrafting prompts for LLMs in KG construction is labor-intensive and brittle. Automatic prompt optimization addresses this challenge by generating optimal prompts.

Method: The study evaluates automatic prompt optimization for triple extraction, testing variations in prompting strategies, LLMs, schema complexity, text length, optimization metrics, and datasets.

Result: Automatic prompt optimization generates human-like prompts and improves triple extraction results, particularly with higher schema complexity and larger texts.

Conclusion: Automatic prompt optimization is effective for triple extraction in KG construction, offering a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

*Teng Wang, Hailei Gong, Changwang Zhang, Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE, a strategy-guided RL framework with novel reward shaping, improves query rewriting for dense retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current query rewriting methods require large supervised data or suffer from inefficient RL exploration.

Method: SAGE uses expert-crafted strategies (e.g., semantic expansion) in an RL framework with Strategic Credit Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS).

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, reduces exploration, and lowers inference cost.

Conclusion: Strategy-guided RL with nuanced reward shaping offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretable paradigm for robust information retrieval.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

*Menglong Zhang, Fuyuan Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimBelief is a meta-RL framework using task belief similarity in BAMDPs for efficient exploration and adaptation in sparse reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of accurate task identification in sparse reward environments, where traditional methods relying on reward reconstruction fail.

Method: Proposes SimBelief, leveraging latent task belief metrics to extract common features of similar tasks and integrate them into specific task beliefs for rapid adaptation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward tasks in MuJoCo and panda-gym environments.

Conclusion: SimBelief effectively addresses sparse reward challenges by unifying shared and specific task features, enhancing exploration and adaptation.

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

*Johannes Rückert, Louise Bloch, Christoph M. Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs are used to analyze diagrams for adherence to data visualization principles, showing effectiveness in identifying issues like missing labels but struggling with image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers often misuse diagrams, leading to misinformation. This work aims to automate the identification of such issues using VLMs.

Method: Five VLMs and five prompting strategies are tested on questions derived from visualization guidelines to evaluate their accuracy.

Result: VLMs excel in analyzing diagram types, 3D effects, and legends but perform poorly on image quality and tick marks. Qwen2.5VL and summarizing prompting strategy are top performers.

Conclusion: VLMs can automate the detection of diagram issues, with potential for broader application in data visualization.

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

*Guo Li, Zixiang Xu, Wei Zhang, Yikuan Hu, Xinyu Yang, Nikolay Aristov, Mingjie Tang, Elenna R Dugundji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Temporal-IRL model to predict port congestion by analyzing vessel behavior and berth scheduling, using historical AIS data and achieving strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate port congestion prediction is vital for reliable supply chains, optimizing logistics, and reducing delays and costs.

Method: The study uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) on historical AIS data to reconstruct berth schedules and model vessel sequencing and stay times at a terminal in the Port of New York/New Jersey.

Result: The Temporal-IRL model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting vessel sequencing and port stay times, validated using data from Maher Terminal (2015-2023).

Conclusion: The Temporal-IRL model effectively forecasts port congestion by learning berth scheduling patterns, enhancing supply chain resilience.

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JoyAgents-R1 introduces GRPO for MARL, enhancing efficiency and stability through iterative LLM refinement, Monte Carlo sampling, and adaptive memory evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing cooperative inefficiency and training instability in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Method: Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Monte Carlo sampling, and adaptive memory evolution to refine agents' LLMs and memories.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to larger LLMs on smaller models, with improved training stability and joint benefits.

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1 effectively balances decision-making and memory capabilities, offering a scalable solution for MARL.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatSR leverages multi-modal large language models to perform symbolic regression, incorporating natural language prior knowledge for improved formula generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression methods lack the ability to integrate extensive prior knowledge or understand natural language instructions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ChatSR uses multi-modal large language models to interpret natural language prompts and apply prior knowledge for formula generation.

Result: Tested on 13 datasets, ChatSR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong zero-shot capability with unseen prior knowledge.

Conclusion: ChatSR advances symbolic regression by effectively utilizing natural language prior knowledge, enhancing both performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Formulas are the language of communication between humans and nature. The
discovery of formulas to describe natural laws from observational data is the
purpose of scientific research. It is also an important research topic in
artificial intelligence, which is called a symbolic regression problem. Most of
the existing symbolic regression methods generate expressions directly from
observed data. Although in some methods, we can inject some prior knowledge
into the model by adding constraints or introducing some special character
hints. However, these methods can only introduce a limited amount of prior
knowledge specified in advance. Not to mention understanding natural language
instructions. In this article, based on the powerful knowledge reserve and
language understanding ability of multi-modal large language models, we present
ChatSR, which acts like a knowledgeable human scientist, and we can tell it any
prior knowledge through natural language to guide it in formula generation. By
testing on 13 datasets, ChatSR not only shows state-of-the-art performance on
traditional symbolic regression tasks. More notably, ChatSR can well understand
the prior knowledge contained in natural language prompts and improve the
quality of generated expressions. In addition, it is exciting that ChatSR has a
good zero-shot capability to understand prior knowledge that is not present in
the training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted human society,
influencing various domains. Among them, academia is not simply a domain
affected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs.
In academic publication, this phenomenon is represented during the
incorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts.
LLMs hold transformative potential for the full-scale implementation of
automated scholarly paper review (ASPR), but they also pose new issues and
challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey paper, we aim to provide a
holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin with a survey to find out
which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review what ASPR-related
technological bottlenecks have been solved with the incorporation of LLM
technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods, new datasets, new
source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for ASPR. Furthermore,
we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and investigate the
attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR. Lastly, we discuss
the challenges and future directions associated with the development of LLMs
for ASPR. This survey serves as an inspirational reference for the researchers

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-Reasoner optimizes LLM reasoning by dynamically guiding the reasoning process, reducing errors and computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiencies and error propagation in LLMs' prolonged reasoning chains.

Method: Introduces Meta-Reasoner, a framework using contextual multi-armed bandits to evaluate and optimize reasoning strategies.

Result: Improves reasoning in tasks like math and puzzles, showing scalability for broader applications.

Conclusion: Meta-Reasoner offers a dynamic, adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on prolonged reasoning chains
to solve complex tasks. However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to
high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can
derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a
framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs
to "think about how to think." Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition
and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor,
decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs
contextual multi-armed bandits to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress and
select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from
scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational
resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical
reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to
overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise
in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for
reasoning-intensive tasks.

*Sara Rajaee, Kumar Pratik, Gabriele Cesa, Arash Behboodi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a verifier-in-the-loop design for AI reasoning, using intermediate feedback to improve accuracy and efficiency, avoiding costly trajectory-based RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based methods for AI reasoning are computationally expensive due to reliance on rolled-out trajectories and sparse rewards.

Method: Introduces a verifier-in-the-loop approach with Lean, providing step-by-step intermediate feedback during reasoning.

Result: Empirical results show improved reasoning accuracy and efficiency with local verification.

Conclusion: Step-by-step verification offers a more efficient alternative to trajectory-based RL methods in AI reasoning.

Abstract: The most promising recent methods for AI reasoning require applying variants
of reinforcement learning (RL) either on rolled out trajectories from the LLMs,
even for the step-wise rewards, or large quantities of human-annotated
trajectory data. The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute
cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning
trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse
rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert
iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving
(ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which, unlike
existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory,
employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the
reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the
step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's
reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

*Kevin Alcedo, Pedro U. Lima, Rachid Alami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning approach for social navigation, addressing belief tracking in POMDPs with a perspective-shift operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social navigation requires reasoning about hidden beliefs of others, which is challenging in partially observable environments.

Method: Proposes a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture and a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, using Influence-based Abstractions.

Result: The approach addresses belief tracking in partially observable social navigation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances social navigation by effectively reasoning about others' hidden beliefs.

Abstract: Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under
uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them.
Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can
naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social
navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others,
inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP),
where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of
Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based
reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the
challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a
perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on
Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating lemma conjecturing can enhance automated reasoning and formalizing mathematics, but it's challenging for neural and symbolic approaches alone.

Method: Lemmanaid trains an LLM to generate lemma templates, then uses symbolic methods to fill details, comparing against neural-only and symbolic methods.

Result: Lemmanaid discovers 29-39.5% of human-written lemmas, outperforming neural-only by 8-15%.

Conclusion: Combining neural and symbolic methods enables effective lemma generation, aiding theory development and formalization.

Abstract: Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly
improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics
in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and
symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical
neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the
Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that
describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details.
We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma
statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Lemmanaid
outperforms both neural and symbolic methods on test sets from Isabelle's HOL
library and from its Archive of Formal Proofs, discovering between 29-39.5% of
the gold standard human written lemmas. This is 8-15% more lemmas than the
neural-only method. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods
we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating
computer-assisted theory development and formalization.

### [255] [TRAIL: Trace Reasoning and Agentic Issue Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08638)
*Darshan Deshpande, Varun Gangal, Hersh Mehta, Jitin Krishnan, Anand Kannappan, Rebecca Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for scalable evaluation of agentic workflows, introduces a taxonomy of error types, and presents a dataset (TRAIL) for benchmarking. Current methods are manual and don't scale, and modern LLMs perform poorly on trace debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity and volume of agentic workflows require scalable evaluation methods, as current manual approaches are insufficient.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy of error types in agentic systems and introduce TRAIL, a dataset of 148 human-annotated traces from real-world applications.

Result: Modern LLMs, like Gemini-2.5-pro, perform poorly on trace debugging, scoring only 11% on TRAIL.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for better evaluation methods for agentic workflows and provides a public dataset (TRAIL) to support future research.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a
critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these
systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific
human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale
with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in
these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs
and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional
software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and
dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal
taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set
of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and
grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we
curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world
applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval.
Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace
debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our
dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future
research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.

*Daniel Jarne Ornia, Nicholas Bishop, Joel Dyer, Wei-Chen Lee, Ani Calinescu, Doyne Farmer, Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies AI agents operating under resource constraints, analyzing how survival pressures reshape their behavior and lead to misalignment with human objectives. It proposes mitigation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the misalignment between AI agents' survival-driven behaviors and human objectives in resource-limited environments.

Method: The authors formalize the problem using a survival bandit framework, providing theoretical and empirical analysis of preference shifts.

Result: The study quantifies the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identifies conditions for misalignment, and proposes mitigation mechanisms.

Conclusion: This work enhances interpretability of AI agent behaviors under survival pressure and offers deployment guidelines for critical environments.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed
to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under
(approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have
resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly
terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that
reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these
agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf,
asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated
misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this
setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical
results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify
conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate
the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work
aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of
AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for
safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: Generative AI boosts developer productivity but raises workforce disruption and deskilling concerns. Research with 21 developers reveals 12 work goals, 75 tasks, and skills needed, leading to 5 insights and a 4-domain skill framework for AI-enhanced developers. Future-proofing requires upskilling in technical and soft skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers use Generative AI in their work and identify the skills needed to thrive in an AI-augmented environment, addressing concerns about productivity gains versus workforce disruption and deskilling.

Method: Conducted research with 21 developers, analyzing 12 work goals, 75 tasks, and associated skills, culminating in 5 key insights and a framework of 4 skill domains for AI-enhanced development.

Result: Identified a 4-domain skill framework (Generative AI, core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and non-engineering) and a 6-step task workflow. Highlighted the need for upskilling in both technical and soft skills.

Conclusion: To prepare developers for AI integration, educational and training programs must focus on a balanced mix of technical and soft skills across all identified domains to mitigate deskilling and ensure adaptability.

Abstract: Generative AI is showing early evidence of productivity gains for software
developers, but concerns persist regarding workforce disruption and deskilling.
We describe our research with 21 developers at the cutting edge of using AI,
summarizing 12 of their work goals we uncovered, together with 75 associated
tasks and the skills & knowledge for each, illustrating how developers use AI
at work. From all of these, we distilled our findings in the form of 5
insights. We found that the skills & knowledge to be a successful AI-enhanced
developer are organized into four domains (using Generative AI effectively,
core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering)
deployed at critical junctures throughout a 6-step task workflow. In order to
"future proof" developers for this age of AI, on-the-job learning initiatives
and computer science degree programs will need to target both "soft" skills and
the technical skills & knowledge in all four domains to reskill, upskill and
safeguard against deskilling.

*Yu Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Zhihu Wang, Yubo Zhang, Xicheng Zhang, Zhengfan Wang, Heyuan Huang, Ming Fan, Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+ enhances RAG by adding application-aware reasoning, improving performance by 3-5% on average and up to 7.5% in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG paradigms lack explicit application of retrieved knowledge, limiting task-specific reasoning.

Method: RAG+ introduces a dual corpus (knowledge + application examples) and retrieves both for structured reasoning.

Result: RAG+ outperforms standard RAG, with gains of 3-5% on average and up to 7.5% in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: RAG+ bridges retrieval and application, advancing knowledge integration for more capable and interpretable LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

### [259] [MCP-Zero: Active Tool Discovery for Autonomous LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01056)
*Xiang Fei, Xiawu Zheng, Hao Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCP-Zero is an active agent framework enabling LLMs to autonomously discover and request tools, improving efficiency and autonomy compared to passive tool selection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents rely on pre-defined tool schemas, limiting their autonomy and robustness. MCP-Zero aims to restore tool discovery autonomy to LLMs.

Method: MCP-Zero uses three mechanisms: Active Tool Request, Hierarchical Semantic Routing, and Iterative Capability Extension to enable autonomous tool discovery and usage.

Result: Experiments show MCP-Zero achieves accurate tool selection, 98% token reduction, and scalable multi-turn performance.

Conclusion: Active tool discovery is a key design pattern for scalable autonomous agent systems, as demonstrated by MCP-Zero.

Abstract: True intelligence requires active capability acquisition, yet current LLM
agents inject pre-defined tool schemas into prompts, reducing models to passive
selectors and falling short of robust general-purpose agency. We introduce
MCP-Zero, an active agent framework that restores tool discovery autonomy to
LLMs themselves. Instead of overwhelming models with all available tools,
MCP-Zero enables agents to actively identify capability gaps, and request
specific tools on-demand, transforming them from large-scale retrievers into
genuine autonomous agents. The framework operates through three core
mechanisms: (1) Active Tool Request, where models autonomously generate
structured requests specifying their exact tool requirements; (2) Hierarchical
Semantic Routing, a two-stage algorithm that matches requests to relevant
servers and tools through improved semantic alignment; (3) Iterative Capability
Extension, enabling agents to progressively build cross-domain toolchains while
maintaining minimal context footprint. We construct MCP-tools, a comprehensive
dataset of 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools from the official
Model-Context-Protocol repository. Experiments demonstrate that MCP-Zero
preserves agent autonomy while achieving substantial efficiency gains: (i)
accurate tool selection from nearly 3k candidates across 248.1k tokens; (ii)
98\% reduction in token consumption on APIBank while maintaining high accuracy;
and (iii) consistent multi-turn performance that scales with tool ecosystem
growth. This work establishes active tool discovery as a fundamental design
pattern for scalable autonomous agent systems.

*Xianliang Yang, Ling Zhang, Haolong Qian, Lei Song, Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeurAgenix is a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework using LLMs to evolve and select heuristics for combinatorial optimization, outperforming existing methods and matching specialized solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic designs for combinatorial optimization rely on manual expertise and lack generalization. HeurAgenix aims to automate and improve this process using LLMs.

Method: HeurAgenix evolves heuristics by comparing seed and high-quality solutions via LLMs, then dynamically selects the best heuristic for each problem state. It uses a dual-reward mechanism for fine-tuning.

Result: HeurAgenix outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or exceeds specialized solvers in benchmarks.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in automating heuristic design and selection for combinatorial optimization, offering a flexible and robust solution.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

### [261] [ConciseHint: Boosting Efficient Reasoning via Continuous Concise Hints during Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18810)
*Siao Tang, Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ConciseHint is a framework that reduces verbosity in reasoning models by injecting hints during generation, maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 produce verbose reasoning, causing inefficiency. Existing methods ignore mid-generation interventions.

Method: ConciseHint injects textual hints (manual or trained) during token generation, adapting hint intensity to query complexity.

Result: Achieves 65% reasoning length reduction on GSM8K with Qwen-3 4B, with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: ConciseHint effectively balances conciseness and performance in reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in single/cross-modal retrieval, especially for visually rich content.

Conclusion: Jina-embeddings-v4 is a powerful multimodal model with strong retrieval capabilities, supported by the new Jina-VDR benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce jina-embeddings-v4, a 3.8 billion parameter multimodal embedding
model that unifies text and image representations through a novel architecture
supporting both single-vector and multi-vector embeddings in the late
interaction style. The model incorporates task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters to optimize performance across diverse retrieval scenarios,
including query-document retrieval, semantic text similarity, and code search.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that jina-embeddings-v4 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both single-modal and cross-modal retrieval
tasks, with particular strength in processing visually rich content such as
tables, charts, diagrams, and mixed-media formats. To facilitate evaluation of
this capability, we also introduce Jina-VDR, a novel benchmark specifically
designed for visually rich image retrieval.

TL;DR: A novel SSL technique combines an α-stable model with a neural network (Neural Steerer) for robust DOA estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for multiple sound sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sound source localization by addressing non-Gaussian signal characteristics and residual reconstruction errors in steering vectors.

Method: Uses a physics-informed neural network (Neural Steerer) to interpolate steering vectors on a fixed microphone array, leveraging an α-stable model for robust DOA estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for multiple sound sources, as indicated by objective scores.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively combines neural networks and α-stable models for superior SSL performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IndieFake Dataset (IFD) to address the lack of diverse ethnic accents in existing audio deepfake datasets, focusing on South-Asian speakers. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and is more challenging than the ITW dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio deepfake datasets lack diversity, especially in South-Asian accents, limiting their real-world applicability. This gap hinders effective detection of deepfakes in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Method: The authors created the IFD dataset, featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio from 50 English-speaking Indian speakers, with balanced distribution and speaker-level characterization.

Result: IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and is more challenging than the ITW benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The IFD dataset fills a critical gap in audio deepfake research, improving detection capabilities for underrepresented accents and enhancing real-world applicability.

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper identifies frequency artifacts in AI-generated music, proposes a detection method, and achieves high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about AI-generated music's ethical and legal challenges by improving detection methods.

Method: Analyzes deconvolution modules in generative models, proving systematic frequency artifacts, and proposes a detection criterion.

Result: Achieves over 99% detection accuracy, comparable to deep learning-based methods.

Conclusion: Simple, interpretable detection methods can effectively identify AI-generated music.

Abstract: The rapid rise of generative AI has transformed music creation, with millions
of users engaging in AI-generated music. Despite its popularity, concerns
regarding copyright infringement, job displacement, and ethical implications
have led to growing scrutiny and legal challenges. In parallel, AI-detection
services have emerged, yet these systems remain largely opaque and privately
controlled, mirroring the very issues they aim to address. This paper explores
the fundamental properties of synthetic content and how it can be detected.
Specifically, we analyze deconvolution modules commonly used in generative
models and mathematically prove that their outputs exhibit systematic frequency
artifacts -- manifesting as small yet distinctive spectral peaks. This
phenomenon, related to the well-known checkerboard artifact, is shown to be
inherent to a chosen model architecture rather than a consequence of training
data or model weights. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive
experiments on open-source models, as well as commercial AI-music generators
such as Suno and Udio. We use these insights to propose a simple and
interpretable detection criterion for AI-generated music. Despite its
simplicity, our method achieves detection accuracy on par with deep
learning-based approaches, surpassing 99% accuracy on several scenarios.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a harmonic-structure-based F0 estimation method (HAS) for FFRs, outperforming the standard ACF method by reducing RMSE by 8.8% to 47.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving F0 estimation in FFRs, which is crucial for understanding neural encoding of speech, as current methods (like ACF) perform poorly.

Method: Proposes HAS, a stimulus-aware filterbank that aggregates harmonic amplitudes and selects the most prominent peak, not the highest.

Result: HAS reduced RMSE by 8.8% to 47.4% compared to ACF in FFRs from 16 subjects.

Conclusion: HAS is a superior F0 estimation method for FFRs, leveraging harmonic structure and stimulus awareness.

Abstract: The Frequency Following Response (FFR) reflects the brain's neural encoding
of auditory stimuli including speech. Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a
physical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there
has been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when
F0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the
Autocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates
harmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for
speech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in
two steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs
is already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively
aggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at
non-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation
(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus
F0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,
our method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying
periodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
propose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure.
Analyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech
stimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method
outperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within
each response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the
stimulus.

*Yuto Kondo, Hirokazu Kameoka, Kou Tanaka, Takuhiro Kaneko, Noboru Harada*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes training neural networks to assess subjective speech impressions using personalized descriptors (SVDs), leveraging both absolute (ACR) and comparison (CCR) ratings. It introduces ppref as a metric and finds CCR training more effective than ACR, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop models that can score subjective speech impressions (e.g., 'cute voice') using personalized descriptors, addressing gaps in automatic speech quality assessment (SQA).

Method: A framework accommodating SVDs is designed, using datasets with ACR and CCR labels. RankNet learning is explored for CCR data, and ppref is introduced as a performance metric.

Result: PPref shows moderate accuracy with limited data, and CCR training outperforms ACR training.

Conclusion: CCR data is effective for training models on personalized SVDs, even with limited data, offering practical applications in subjective speech assessment.

Abstract: We tackle a new task of training neural network models that can assess
subjective impressions conveyed through speech and assign scores accordingly,
inspired by the work on automatic speech quality assessment (SQA). Speech
impressions are often described using phrases like `cute voice.' We define such
phrases as subjective voice descriptors (SVDs). Focusing on the difference in
usage scenarios between the proposed task and automatic SQA, we design a
framework capable of accommodating SVDs personalized to each individual, such
as `my favorite voice.' In this work, we compiled a dataset containing speech
labels derived from both abosolute category ratings (ACR) and comparison
category ratings (CCR).
  As an evaluation metric for assessment performance, we introduce ppref, the
accuracy of the predicted score ordering of two samples on CCR test samples.
Alongside the conventional model and learning methods based on ACR data, we
also investigated RankNet learning using CCR data. We experimentally find that
the ppref is moderate even with very limited training data. We also discover
the CCR training is superior to the ACR training. These results support the
idea that assessment models based on personalized SVDs, which typically must be
trained on limited data, can be effectively learned from CCR data.

*Christoph Minixhofer, Ondrej Klejch, Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTSDS2, an improved metric for evaluating TTS systems, validated across domains and languages, and releases resources for synthetic speech evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS evaluation metrics (subjective and objective) are either inconsistent or lack validation, especially with advanced TTS systems producing near-real speech.

Method: The authors propose TTSDS2, a robust metric, and provide a dataset, pipeline, and benchmark for evaluating synthetic speech.

Result: TTSDS2 outperforms 15 other metrics, consistently correlating well (Spearman >0.50) with subjective scores across domains and languages.

Conclusion: TTSDS2 and the released resources address gaps in TTS evaluation, offering reliable and scalable solutions.

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a speaker embedding that is both effective and explainable, improving evaluation in speech tasks.

Conclusion: Vo-Ve enhances speech task evaluations due to its explainability and competitive performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Vo-Ve, a novel voice-vector embedding that captures
speaker identity. Unlike conventional speaker embeddings, Vo-Ve is explainable,
as it contains the probabilities of explicit voice attribute classes. Through

*Tawsif Ahmed, Andrej Radonjic, Gollam Rabby*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Sleeping-DISCO 9M is a large-scale pre-training dataset for music and song, addressing the lack of open-source, high-quality datasets for generative music tasks by using real-world popular music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for generative music tasks are either synthetic or lack real-world relevance, limiting their adoption.

Method: The dataset is constructed using actual popular music and world-renowned artists.

Result: Sleeping-DISCO 9M provides a high-quality, real-world music dataset for tasks like text-music generation and singing-voice synthesis.

Conclusion: This dataset fills a gap in the generative music community by offering a realistic and practical resource.

Abstract: We present Sleeping-DISCO 9M, a large-scale pre-training dataset for music
and song. To the best of our knowledge, there are no open-source high-quality
dataset representing popular and well-known songs for generative music modeling
tasks such as text-music, music-captioning, singing-voice synthesis, melody
reconstruction and cross-model retrieval. Past contributions focused on
isolated and constrained factors whose core perspective was to create synthetic
or re-recorded music corpus (e.g. GTSinger, M4Singer) and arbitrarily
large-scale audio datasets (e.g. DISCO-10M and LAIONDISCO-12M) had been another
focus for the community. Unfortunately, adoption of these datasets has been
below substantial in the generative music community as these datasets fail to
reflect real-world music and its flavour. Our dataset changes this narrative
and provides a dataset that is constructed using actual popular music and
world-renowned artists.

*Julien Guinot, Elio Quinton, György Fazekas*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: GDR introduces a diffusion-based framework for controllable text-music retrieval, improving performance and enabling interactive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal contrastive models lack controllability and flexibility in text-music retrieval due to ambiguous language mappings.

Method: GDR uses diffusion models to generate queries in a retrieval-optimized latent space, incorporating tools like negative prompting and DDIM inversion.

Result: GDR outperforms contrastive teacher models and supports audio-only retrieval with non-jointly trained encoders.

Conclusion: GDR enhances retrieval performance and interactive control, offering a new direction for controllable retrieval systems.

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive models have achieved strong performance in text-audio
retrieval and zero-shot settings, but improving joint embedding spaces remains
an active research area. Less attention has been given to making these systems
controllable and interactive for users. In text-music retrieval, the ambiguity
of freeform language creates a many-to-many mapping, often resulting in
inflexible or unsatisfying results.
  We introduce Generative Diffusion Retriever (GDR), a novel framework that
leverages diffusion models to generate queries in a retrieval-optimized latent
space. This enables controllability through generative tools such as negative
prompting and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) inversion, opening a
new direction in retrieval control. GDR improves retrieval performance over
contrastive teacher models and supports retrieval in audio-only latent spaces
using non-jointly trained encoders. Finally, we demonstrate that GDR enables
effective post-hoc manipulation of retrieval behavior, enhancing interactive
control for text-music retrieval tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance controllability in text-to-music generation by addressing the underuse of positional embeddings for time-varying conditions.

Method: Adds rotary positional embeddings to decoupled cross-attention layers for precise conditioning.

Result: Increases control accuracy from 56.6% to 61.1% with 6.75x fewer parameters than SOTA methods.

Conclusion: MuseControlLite offers superior controllability at lower computational cost, outperforming existing models like MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet.

Abstract: We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune
text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various
time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is
that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music
generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the
condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an
example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings
to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6%
to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than
state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion
Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical
attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating
improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet
at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HI-SQL improves Text-to-SQL accuracy by using historical query logs for hint generation, reducing errors and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in handling complex SQL queries with LLMs, such as multi-table joins and nested conditions, lead to high computational costs and error-prone pipelines.

Method: Proposes HI-SQL, a pipeline with a hint generation mechanism using historical query logs to guide SQL generation, avoiding multi-step approaches.

Result: Significantly improves query accuracy on benchmark datasets while ensuring efficiency in LLM calls and latency.

Conclusion: HI-SQL offers a robust and practical solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems by leveraging historical data for hints.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

*Shuang Ao, Yi Dong, Jinwei Hu, Sarvapali Ramchurn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLoRA is a pruning-based method to improve safety in LoRA-fine-tuned LLMs by selectively removing unsafe LoRA layers, using E-DIEM for detection, and outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, leading to harmful outputs. Existing methods fail to address complex parameter shifts.

Method: Proposes SPLoRA, which prunes unsafe LoRA layers using E-DIEM, a similarity metric for detecting safety misalignment. Evaluated on mixed and benign datasets.

Result: SPLoRA reduces safety risks, maintains or improves performance, and lowers inference overhead, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPLoRA is a scalable, efficient solution for safer and more reliable LLMs, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

*Zihan Wang, Rui Pan, Jiarui Yao, Robert Csordas, Linjie Li, Lu Yin, Jiajun Wu, Tong Zhang, Manling Li, Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) introduces sequential expert communication in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, improving performance and efficiency through dynamic routing and iterative processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE models lack interaction between experts, limiting representational capacity. CoE aims to enhance this by enabling iterative expert communication.

Method: CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts within a layer, using dynamic routing at each step to select experts.

Result: CoE reduces validation loss (1.20 to 1.12 on math tasks) and offers memory-efficient scaling (17.6-42% reduction).

Conclusion: CoE's iterative routing and residual structure enhance expert specialization and model expressiveness, providing a new scaling axis.

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes an MFA-ANN model for online prediction of product weight in injection molding, outperforming benchmarks with improved accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address untimely detection and monitoring lag in injection molding quality anomalies.

Method: Integrates mechanism-based and data-driven analysis, using a mixed feature attention-ANN model with hierarchical feature extraction and self-attention for feature fusion.

Result: Achieves RMSE of 0.0281, outperforming benchmarks by 15.6-25.7%. Mixed feature modeling and attention contribute 22.4% and 11.2% improvements, respectively.

Conclusion: The MFA-ANN model offers an efficient, reliable solution for intelligent quality control in injection molding.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIM enhances cooperative MARL by directing agent influence to critical state dimensions (CoG) using stability analysis, intrinsic rewards, and eligibility-trace-based credit, improving performance in sparse reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse rewards in MARL limit exploration and coordination; FIM addresses this by focusing agent influence on critical task elements.

Method: FIM identifies CoG state dimensions, designs counterfactual intrinsic rewards, and uses eligibility-trace-based credit to synchronize agent focus.

Result: FIM outperforms baselines in MARL benchmarks, enabling robust cooperation in sparse reward environments.

Conclusion: FIM effectively improves cooperative MARL by targeting critical state dimensions and enhancing coordinated influence among agents.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

TL;DR: HOLA is an optimization framework for deploying LLMs on edge devices, combining Hierarchical Speculative Decoding, AdaComp-RAG, and LoBi for improved efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High compute and memory demands of LLMs hinder real-time applications in sectors like healthcare and education. Existing solutions like quantization and pruning are insufficient.

Method: HOLA uses Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for faster inference, AdaComp-RAG for adaptive retrieval, and LoBi for structured pruning and quantization.

Result: Achieved 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency/memory on edge devices like Jetson Nano.

Conclusion: HOLA is scalable and production-ready, offering efficient LLM deployment for edge applications.

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:

TL;DR: This paper evaluates music generation models by comparing human preferences with objective metrics, ranking state-of-the-art models and providing an open dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing music generation models is challenging due to the subjectivity of human preferences and the lack of reliable objective metrics.

Method: Generated 6k songs using 12 models, conducted 15k pairwise comparisons with 2.5k participants, and analyzed correlations between human preferences and metrics.

Result: Ranked current state-of-the-art music generation models and metrics based on human preference.

Conclusion: Provided an open dataset to advance subjective metric evaluation in music generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created
compositions, yet evaluating these models remains challenging. While human
preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio
alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k
songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges deteriorate over time, and traffic monitoring is crucial for assessing their service life. Current CV-based methods have privacy and lighting issues, while traditional methods lack flexibility.

Method: Proposes a deep-learning pipeline combining CV-assisted dataset generation, supervised training, and GNNs to process SHM sensor data.

Result: Achieves 99% accuracy for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles in a real-world case study.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between CV and SHM, offering high accuracy with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

*Shashank Yadav, Vignesh Subbian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks for dynamic time-series prediction in critical care, addressing challenges of traditional methods like gradient, occlusion, and permutation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability is crucial for deploying deep learning models in critical care, but existing methods struggle with dynamic prediction tasks due to time-varying dependencies and temporal smoothness.

Method: The work analyzes failure modes of common interpretability algorithms and advocates for learnable mask-based frameworks that incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints.

Result: Learnable mask-based approaches are shown to provide more reliable and consistent interpretations for dynamic time-series prediction in critical care.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that learnable mask-based methods are better suited for interpretability in evolving conditions like critical care.

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

*Nitish Nagesh, Ziyu Wang, Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel LLM-augmented method for synthetic health data generation ensures causal fairness, reducing bias by 70% compared to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack focus on causal fairness in health data, limiting equitable outcomes.

Method: Developed an LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method preserving causal structure for fairness.

Result: Generated data deviates <10% on fairness metrics; reduces bias by 70% on sensitive attributes.

Conclusion: Enhances equitable health research and care by providing causally fair synthetic data.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

*Fanny Lehmann, Firat Ozdemir, Benedikt Soja, Torsten Hoefler, Siddhartha Mishra, Sebastian Schemm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates Aurora, an AI weather forecasting foundation model, for predicting hydrological variables not included in pretraining. A lightweight decoder approach outperforms full fine-tuning in efficiency and accuracy, leveraging physical relationships in the latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if foundation models in Earth sciences can extend to new variables without full fine-tuning, making them more accessible and preserving their physical relationships.

Method: Compare a lightweight decoder approach (trained on latent representations) to full fine-tuning for predicting hydrological variables.

Result: Decoder approach reduces training time by 50% and memory by 35%, maintains accuracy, and preserves autoregressive stability. Accuracy depends on physical correlations in the latent space.

Conclusion: Foundation models should be evaluated on their extensibility to new variables without full fine-tuning, enhancing accessibility and adoption in Earth sciences.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

### [287] [On the algorithmic construction of deep ReLU networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19104)
*Daan Huybrechs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural networks as algorithms, constructing exact solutions like sorting, and highlights their recursive, parallel nature and depth advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding what neural networks can represent mathematically, beyond training on data, by treating them as algorithms.

Method: Constructive programming of neural networks (e.g., exact sorting) and analyzing their properties, focusing on ReLU networks.

Result: Neural networks as algorithms are recursive, parallel, and benefit from depth, though constrained by continuity.

Conclusion: Constructed neural networks demonstrate superior expressivity with depth, offering insights into their algorithmic capabilities.

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

*Kenneth L. Clarkson, Lior Horesh, Takuya Ito, Charlotte Park, Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can exactly implement Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering, demonstrating their ability to learn precise algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether transformers can learn and implement precise algorithms, specifically focusing on k-means clustering.

Method: Theoretical proof of a transformer architecture (k-means transformer) implementing Lloyd's algorithm, followed by numerical implementation and experiments.

Result: Exact correspondence between the transformer and Lloyd's algorithm, with interpretable alterations yielding novel clustering variants.

Conclusion: Transformers can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering interpretable implementations of algorithms.

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

*Andreas Bjerregaard, Søren Hauberg, Anders Krogh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Riemannian generative decoder to simplify manifold-valued representation learning by eliminating the encoder and optimizing latents with a Riemannian optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Riemannian representation learning involve complex density approximations and manifold constraints, limiting applicability and performance.

Method: The proposed method uses a Riemannian generative decoder to find manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents, discarding the encoder to simplify constraints.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, the method captures non-Euclidean structure and aligns latent spaces with data geometry.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies manifold learning, is compatible with existing architectures, and produces interpretable latent spaces.

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

*Cyrill Bösch, Geoffrey Roeder, Marc Serra-Garcia, Ryan P. Adams*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned using a local learning rule, applied to nonlinear oscillators for tasks like Gaussian mixture sampling and MNIST digit generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how out-of-equilibrium driving protocols in SGMs can be learned efficiently and applied to practical problems like sampling and image generation.

Method: Uses a local learning rule to compute gradients from force measurements or observed dynamics, implemented in a network of driven nonlinear oscillators.

Result: Successfully applied to sample from a 2D Gaussian mixture and trained a 10x10 oscillator network to generate MNIST digits (0s and 1s).

Conclusion: Local learning rules can effectively train SGMs for complex tasks, demonstrating potential for scalable and efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

*Barry Wang, Avi Schwarzschild, Alexander Robey, Ali Payani, Charles Fleming, Mingjie Sun, Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Command-V is a backpropagation-free method for transferring behaviors between LLMs by copying residual activation adapters, requiring minimal compute and no original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like full finetuning or distillation for behavior transfer in LLMs are costly and repetitive. Command-V aims to simplify this process.

Method: Command-V profiles layer activations, derives linear converters between layers, and applies donor interventions in the recipient's activation space.

Result: In case studies (safety-refusal, jailbreak, chain-of-thought reasoning), Command-V matches or outperforms direct finetuning with significantly less compute.

Conclusion: Command-V offers an efficient, low-cost alternative for behavior transfer in LLMs, with promising performance.

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

### [292] [Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19143)
*Paul C. Bogdan, Uzay Macar, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three methods to analyze sentence-level reasoning traces in large language models, identifying 'thought anchors'—key reasoning steps—and provides a tool for visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability challenges in long-form chain-of-thought reasoning by decomposing the reasoning process at the sentence level.

Method: Three attribution methods: (1) black-box counterfactual importance, (2) white-box attention pattern aggregation, and (3) causal attribution via attention suppression.

Result: Identified 'thought anchors'—critical reasoning steps like planning or backtracking—that disproportionately influence reasoning.

Conclusion: Sentence-level analysis enhances understanding of reasoning models, supported by consistent findings across methods and a case study.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

*Amir Faiyaz, Tara Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradualDiff-Fed is an FL framework for efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) by transmitting only weight differences, reducing communication costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for privacy-preserving, decentralized fine-tuning of LLMs in specialized domains like medical science, addressing challenges in performance and large model sizes.

Method: Introduces GradualDiff-Fed, which transmits only model weight differences during federated learning rounds to reduce communication overhead.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to centralized training with significantly reduced communication costs.

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed is a scalable and efficient solution for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs in distributed settings.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

### [294] [Distilling Tool Knowledge into Language Models via Back-Translated Traces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19171)
*Xingyue Huang, Xianglong Hu, Zifeng Ding, Yuan He, Rishabh, Waleed Alzarooni, Ziyu Ye, Wendong Fan, Bailan He, Haige Bo, Changran Hu, Guohao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to distill tool knowledge into LLMs using natural language, improving math problem-solving without inference-time tool dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with exact mathematical computations and multi-step reasoning. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) helps but introduces scalability issues.

Method: A Solver Agent solves problems using planning, tool calls, and reflection. A back-translation pipeline converts TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces.

Result: Fine-tuning a small model on synthesized traces improves performance on math benchmarks without needing tools at inference.

Conclusion: The approach successfully internalizes tool knowledge and reasoning patterns in LLMs, enhancing their math capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

### [295] [Private Model Personalization Revisited](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19220)
*Conor Snedeker, Xinyu Zhou, Raef Bassily*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in federated learning, focusing on privately recovering shared embeddings and local representations with small excess risk. It improves upon prior work by handling noisy labels, broader user distributions, and reducing privacy error terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of privately learning shared embeddings and local representations in federated settings, especially under heterogeneous user data and noisy labels, while improving utility guarantees and privacy error terms.

Method: The proposed method is a private, efficient federated learning algorithm based on FedRep, incorporating differential privacy and handling sub-Gaussian user distributions. It also uses the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform for dimension reduction in binary classification.

Result: The results show improved utility guarantees under broader user distributions, reduced privacy error terms, and dimension-independent risk bounds in binary classification under a margin loss.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that dimension-independent risk bounds and improved privacy-utility trade-offs are achievable in federated learning for model personalization under user-level DP.

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores high-precision training of PINNs for unbounded domains, focusing on singularity formation in PDEs. A modular approach is proposed, and results show significant improvements in precision and efficiency for 1D and 2D cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the precision of PINNs for studying singularities in PDEs, particularly in unbounded domains, and to bridge the gap between numerical solutions and rigorous analysis.

Method: A modularized approach involving neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization algorithm, combined with computer-assisted proofs and PDE analysis.

Result: Achieved high-precision solutions for 1D Burgers equation and a 2D Boussinesq equation, with a loss 4 digits smaller than prior work and fewer training steps.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for machine-precision solutions in higher-dimensional problems, advancing the study of PDE singularities.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

Motivation: To investigate universality properties of kernels in non-Euclidean domains, specifically Riemannian symmetric spaces, to support kernel methods for manifold-valued data.

Method: Developed fundamental tools for analyzing kernel universality in Riemannian symmetric spaces and applied them to prove universality of recent kernel examples.

Result: Proved the universality of several positive definite kernels on Riemannian symmetric spaces, validating their use in practical applications.

Conclusion: The study advances kernel method theory for non-Euclidean domains, offering theoretical support for their application in machine learning with manifold-valued data.

Abstract: The universality properties of kernels characterize the class of functions
that can be approximated in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space and
are of fundamental importance in the theoretical underpinning of kernel methods
in machine learning. In this work, we establish fundamental tools for
investigating universality properties of kernels in Riemannian symmetric
spaces, thereby extending the study of this important topic to kernels in
non-Euclidean domains. Moreover, we use the developed tools to prove the
universality of several recent examples from the literature on positive
definite kernels defined on Riemannian symmetric spaces, thus providing
theoretical justification for their use in applications involving
manifold-valued data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated contrastive learning method for anomaly detection in distributed systems, addressing privacy, heterogeneity, and pattern recognition challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of centralized anomaly detection methods, particularly in data privacy, node heterogeneity, and fine-grained anomaly recognition.

Method: Combines federated learning for distributed collaboration and contrastive learning for feature discrimination. Uses local node embeddings, positive/negative sample pairs, and federated aggregation without raw data exposure.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy and adaptability, effective in complex distributed environments.

Conclusion: Balances privacy and performance, offering a viable solution for intelligent security in distributed systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

*Hadi Khalaf, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Alex Oesterling, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Flavio du Pin Calmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores reward hacking in large language models (LLMs) when optimizing for imperfect reward models, introduces methods like Best-of-Poisson (BoP) to mitigate it, and proposes HedgeTune for optimal inference-time alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models, though useful, are imperfect proxies for complex goals like correctness and safety, leading to reward hacking—where overoptimization subverts alignment goals.

Method: The study analyzes reward hacking under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), introduces Best-of-Poisson (BoP), and proposes HedgeTune for optimal inference-time alignment.

Result: Hedging mitigates reward hacking, achieving better tradeoffs between reward and distortion with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Hedging is an effective tactical choice to avoid overconfidence in proxy rewards, and HedgeTune offers a practical solution to mitigate reward hacking.

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

*Shili Wu, Yizhao Jin, Puhua Niu, Aniruddha Datta, Sean B. Andersson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using global Lipschitz regularization to enhance the robustness of Behavior Cloning (BC) policies against measurement errors and adversarial disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BC policies can be misled by deviations in observations from true states due to errors or disturbances, leading to sub-optimal actions.

Method: A global Lipschitz regularization approach is applied to the policy network, ensuring robustness against bounded norm perturbations. A Lipschitz neural network is constructed for this purpose.

Result: The method provides a robustness certificate for the policy and is empirically validated across various Gymnasium environments.

Conclusion: Lipschitz regularization effectively improves the robustness of BC policies against adversarial and measurement perturbations.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods, CMO and NNR, to improve Graph OOD classification by addressing minority class underperformance and structural noise sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph OOD classification faces performance drops due to category imbalance and structural noise, especially affecting minority classes.

Method: 1. Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) enhances minority class robustness via similarity-based aggregation under worst-case conditions. 2. Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) dynamically weights training samples based on local structural consistency to reduce noise impact.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address challenges in Graph OOD classification, improving performance for minority classes and noise resilience.

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

*Yang Zhou, Xiaoning Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BADGNN is a batch-agnostic framework for dynamic graph neural networks, addressing temporal discontinuity in large batches via Temporal Lipschitz Regularization and Adaptive Attention Adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large batch sizes in MDGNNs disrupt event sequences, causing temporal information loss and hindering optimization.

Method: Proposes BADGNN with Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space and Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to mitigate attention distortion.

Result: BADGNN maintains strong performance, enables larger batch sizes, and faster training compared to TGN on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: BADGNN effectively addresses temporal discontinuity and optimization challenges in dynamic graph neural networks.

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

### [303] [Efficient Extreme Operating Condition Search for Online Relay Setting Calculation in Renewable Power Systems Based on Parallel Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19289)
*Yan Li, Zengli Yang, Youhuai Wang, Jing Wang, Xiaoyu Han, Jingyu Wang, Dongyuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method using PGNN is proposed to solve the EOCS problem efficiently for online relay setting calculation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The volatility of renewable power systems demands faster online relay setting calculations, but current EOCS methods are too slow.

Method: Power system data is structured into four layers and processed by a PGNN for feature extraction, followed by a decision network to predict extreme conditions.

Result: The PGNN method achieves higher accuracy and faster computation than existing methods on modified IEEE test systems.

Conclusion: The proposed PGNN method is effective for online relay setting calculation, addressing the speed and accuracy challenges of EOCS.

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

*Zeyu Bao, Penghao Yu, Haotian Jiang, Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep linear SSMs' expressiveness is studied, showing depth and width are equivalent without constraints but differ under norm constraints, with deep SSMs outperforming shallow ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how depth and width in deep linear SSMs affect their expressive capacity, especially under parameter norm constraints.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to compare depth and width effects in SSMs, including norm constraints.

Result: Depth and width are equivalent without constraints, but deep SSMs excel under norm constraints. Upper bounds on required depth are derived.

Conclusion: Deep SSMs are more expressive than shallow ones under norm constraints, with theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

*Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Aditi Maheshwari, Amr Youssef, Deepa Kundur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks can evade deep learning-based FDIA detection in smart grids, with success rates exceeding 99.7%. Adversarial training is proposed as a defense, improving model robustness without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in deep learning models used for FDIA detection in smart grids and propose a defense mechanism.

Method: A novel adversarial attack framework using the Fast Gradient Sign Method to perturb LCDR measurements, evaluated on various deep learning models.

Result: High vulnerability of models to adversarial attacks (up to 99.7% success rate); adversarial training significantly improves robustness.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to DLS-based FDIA detection, and adversarial training is an effective countermeasure.

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

*Vineet Punyamoorty, Aditya Malusare, Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CroMoTEX is a contrastive learning framework that uses chest X-rays to improve ECG representations for diagnosing cardiac pathologies, achieving high performance without needing CXRs at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage multimodal data (ECGs and CXRs) for better cardiac diagnosis, especially where CXRs are unavailable during deployment.

Method: Uses supervised cross-modal contrastive learning with adaptive hard negative weighting to align ECG and CXR representations.

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving up to 78.31 AUROC on edema in large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: CroMoTEX enables scalable ECG-based diagnosis by learning from CXRs during training, without requiring them at test time.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

*Sudesh Bhagat, Raghupathi Kandiboina, Ibne Farabi Shihab, Skylar Knickerbocker, Neal Hawkins, Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) in crash data using database narrative alignment and BERT model analysis, revealing 24.03% AIM incidents. Findings suggest targeted training and data management improvements are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road traffic crashes are a major global cause of fatalities, necessitating accurate crash data for better prevention strategies and policy development.

Method: Employed database narrative alignment and BERT model to analyze 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022), identifying 2,767 AIM incidents. Used Probit Logit model for statistical analysis.

Result: 24.03% AIM rate; alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents had lower mismatch, while unknown vehicle types and older drivers were more susceptible. Geospatial clusters identified high-risk regions.

Conclusion: Targeted training programs and improved data management are essential to enhance crash reporting accuracy and support evidence-based policymaking.

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

*Ziyu Zheng, Yaming Yang, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao, Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGMAE improves graph representation learning by reconstructing discrepancy information in heterophilic graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in heterophilic graphs due to over-reliance on neighborhood similarity, ignoring node discrepancies.

Method: Proposes DGMAE, which reconstructs discrepancy information during masking to enhance node distinguishability.

Result: DGMAE preserves node discrepancies effectively and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification, clustering, and graph classification.

Conclusion: DGMAE addresses limitations of current methods, offering superior performance in heterophilic graph tasks.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

*Puneesh Deora, Bhavya Vasudeva, Tina Behnia, Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers use in-context learning to adapt to tasks of varying complexity, favoring the simplest sufficient explanation, akin to Bayesian Occam's razor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers handle hierarchical task structures and complexity levels in practical settings.

Method: Designed testbeds with Markov chains and linear regression, analyzed transformers' behavior, and validated findings with GPT-4.

Result: Transformers identify appropriate complexity levels and parameters, favoring simpler explanations when possible.

Conclusion: Transformers inherently implement a Bayesian Occam's razor, balancing fit and complexity, likely due to diverse training.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

*Shijian Zheng, Fangxiao Jin, Shuhai Zhang, Quan Xue, Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PQS is a novel method for EMS design that uses quadtree-based hierarchical representation and consistency-driven sample selection to reduce evaluation costs and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for EMS design are data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale and budget constraints.

Method: PQS converts image-like layouts into quadtree-based hierarchical representations and uses a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism.

Result: PQS reduces evaluation costs by 75-85% and saves 20.27-38.80 days in design cycles, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PQS is effective for EMS design under limited budgets, offering significant cost and time savings.

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

*Florian Peter Busch, Moritz Willig, Florian Guldan, Kristian Kersting, Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tag-based causal discovery method improves robustness by assigning multiple tags to variables, leveraging existing causal discovery techniques to direct edges and enhance flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current type-based causal discovery lacks robustness due to single-type assignments, limiting flexibility and practical applicability.

Method: Proposes a tag-based approach where multiple tags per variable guide edge direction. Existing methods direct initial edges, which then inform tag relations to direct undirected edges.

Result: Experimental evaluations show improved causal discovery and alignment with common knowledge.

Conclusion: Tag-based causal discovery outperforms type-based methods by offering greater flexibility and robustness in directing causal edges.

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

TL;DR: A method to reduce overestimation bias in Q-learning and actor-critic methods using distributional RL, improving existing algorithms with minimal code changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the well-known bias problems in Q-value estimation that hinder convergence in reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposes a locally adaptive overestimation reduction mechanism built on distributional RL, compatible with existing algorithms like double Q-learning.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: The framework is simple to implement and enhances existing distributional RL algorithms with adaptive overestimation control.

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEGNN and DistEGNN enhance equivariant GNNs for large-scale geometric graphs, improving efficiency and performance on sparse or distributed graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant GNNs struggle with efficiency and performance on large or sparsified graphs.

Method: FastEGNN uses virtual nodes for approximation and distinct message passing, while DistEGNN extends this for distributed processing.

Result: Superior efficiency and performance on benchmarks like N-body systems, protein dynamics, and Fluid113K.

Conclusion: The models advance large-scale equivariant graph learning, offering practical solutions for scalability.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework to recover class memberships from unlearned models without needing the original model, addressing a gap in Machine Unlearning (MU) vulnerability research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MU attack research requires access to original models, violating privacy goals. This study explores vulnerabilities in MU without such access.

Method: Uses a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture to translate the problem into Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) for inferring forgotten instance labels.

Result: MRA effectively recovers class memberships of unlearned instances, demonstrated through extensive experiments on real datasets.

Conclusion: The study sets a benchmark for future MU vulnerability research, highlighting privacy risks in unlearning technologies.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

*Zhihao Sui, Liang Hu, Jian Cao, Usman Naseem, Zhongyuan Lai, Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COLUR is a framework for restoring model performance degraded by noisy labels, using a neuroscience-inspired unlearning and relearning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation in deep learning models caused by noisy labels, inspired by neuroscience's forgetting mechanism.

Method: Proposes COLUR, a co-training architecture for unlearning noise and refining label confidence for relearning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four real datasets after model restoration and refinement.

Conclusion: COLUR effectively restores and refines model performance degraded by noisy labels.

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

### [319] [Dimension Reduction for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19537)
*Paul Kahlmeyer, Markus Fischer, Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve symbolic regression by identifying and substituting variable combinations, enhancing algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression struggles with complex formulas due to increasing variables and operators. Naturally occurring formulas often use fixed variable combinations, which can simplify the problem if identified.

Method: The method searches for small valid substitutions in the expression space, testing their validity via functional dependence. This iterative dimension reduction works with any symbolic regression approach.

Result: The method reliably finds valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

Conclusion: Iterative dimension reduction by substitution is an effective way to enhance symbolic regression, especially for complex formulas.

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

### [320] [Overtuning in Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19540)
*Lennart Schneider, Bernd Bischl, Matthias Feurer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates overtuning, a form of overfitting in hyperparameter optimization (HPO), where excessive optimization of validation error harms generalization. It formally defines overtuning, analyzes its prevalence, and suggests mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of overtuning in HPO, where minimizing validation error may not improve generalization, and to quantify its impact.

Method: The study reanalyzes HPO benchmark data to assess overtuning's prevalence, severity, and influencing factors like resampling strategy and dataset size.

Result: Overtuning is common (10% of cases), typically mild but occasionally severe, leading to worse generalization than default configurations.

Conclusion: Awareness of overtuning is crucial, especially for small datasets, and further mitigation strategies are needed.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

### [321] [Discovering Symmetries of ODEs by Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19550)
*Paul Kahlmeyer, Niklas Merk, Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression is adapted to find Lie point symmetries in ODEs, outperforming existing CASs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated solving of nonlinear ODEs is challenging, and current CASs struggle with finding Lie point symmetries.

Method: Search-based symbolic regression is adapted to identify generators of Lie point symmetries.

Result: The approach successfully finds symmetries that existing CASs cannot detect.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression offers a promising alternative for solving complex ODEs by uncovering hidden symmetries.

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

### [322] [ConCM: Consistency-Driven Calibration and Matching for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19558)
*QinZhe Wang, Zixuan Chen, Keke Huang, Xiu Su, Chunhua Yang, Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConCM, a framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that optimizes feature-structure consistency to mitigate knowledge conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for FSCIL suffer from prototype deviation and fixed embedding spaces, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM) with memory-aware prototype calibration and dynamic structure matching.

Result: ConCM outperforms current methods by 3.20% and 3.68% on mini-ImageNet and CUB200 benchmarks.

Conclusion: ConCM effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by ensuring feature-structure consistency, achieving superior performance without class-number priors.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

*Jungwoo Park, Taewhoo Lee, Chanwoong Yoon, Hyeon Hwang, Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP) prevents extreme activation outliers in LLMs, improving quantization performance with minimal training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme activation outliers in LLMs degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.

Method: OSP combines the Muon optimizer, Single-Scale RMSNorm, and learnable embedding projection to prevent outlier formation.

Result: A 1.4B-parameter OSP model achieves a 35.7 average benchmark score under 4-bit quantization, with near-zero excess kurtosis.

Conclusion: Outliers are not inherent to LLMs but result from training strategies; OSP enables more efficient deployment.

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

*Pengpeng Ouyang, Dong Chen, Tong Yang, Shuo Feng, Zhao Jin, Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAF is a framework for few-shot time series forecasting, combining generalized and task-specific features to improve accuracy with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of insufficient historical data in multi-task and few-shot forecasting by leveraging generalized and specific features.

Method: FAF includes three modules: GKM for generalized features, TSM for task-specific features, and RM to dynamically combine them.

Result: FAF outperforms baselines, achieving a 41.81% improvement on CO₂ emissions data.

Conclusion: FAF enables robust and personalized forecasting with sparse data, proving effective in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open dataset of QI-like stellarator plasma boundaries, paired with equilibria and metrics, to address the lack of standardized optimization problems in stellarator design. It provides benchmarks, baselines, and tools to facilitate community progress in fusion energy research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized optimization problems and datasets in stellarator design, especially for QI configurations, hinders broader community progress and data-driven approaches in fusion energy research.

Method: The authors generated a dataset by sampling QI fields and optimizing plasma boundaries. They introduced three benchmarks of increasing complexity, providing reference code, evaluation scripts, and classical optimization baselines.

Result: The dataset and benchmarks enable efficient generation of novel configurations using learned models, bypassing expensive physics simulations.

Conclusion: Openly releasing the dataset and tools aims to lower barriers for researchers and accelerate progress toward commercial fusion energy.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

### [326] [Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19830)
*Yichao Fu, Rui Ge, Zelei Shao, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning improves speculative decoding by adding step-level parallelism, increasing speedup from 1.4x to 2.1x while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level speculative decoding (SD) has limited speedup due to the exponential drop in correctness for longer token drafts. Lookahead Reasoning addresses this by leveraging step-level parallelism in reasoning models.

Method: A lightweight draft model proposes future steps; the target model expands these in one batched pass. A verifier ensures semantic correctness, allowing regeneration of failed steps. Token-level SD operates within each step, multiplying parallelism.

Result: Lookahead Reasoning increases SD's peak speedup from 1.4x to 2.1x across benchmarks like GSM8K and AIME, with better scaling on additional GPU throughput.

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning effectively raises the algorithmic ceiling of SD, offering significant speedup improvements while preserving answer quality.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

### [327] [Training Flexible Models of Genetic Variant Effects from Functional Annotations using Accelerated Linear Algebra](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19598)
*Alan N. Amin, Andres Potapczynski, Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepWAS uses fast linear algebra to train large neural networks for genome-wide association studies, improving predictions by optimizing likelihood rather than summary statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geneticists face bottlenecks in predicting phenotype impacts due to expensive linear algebra problems, limiting model size and accuracy.

Method: Leverages modern fast linear algebra techniques to train large neural networks (DeepWAS) for full likelihood optimization.

Result: Larger models improve performance only with full likelihood optimization, enhancing predictions for disease and therapeutic targets.

Conclusion: DeepWAS enables more accurate genetic predictions by overcoming computational bottlenecks, benefiting disease research and therapy development.

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFTv2 improves Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) by reducing computational costs and memory usage while maintaining performance, also extending support for quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high runtime and memory demands of OFT limit its practical deployment, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: OFTv2 replaces weight-centric computations with input-centric matrix-vector multiplications and introduces the Cayley-Neumann parameterization for efficient orthogonal parameterization.

Result: OFTv2 achieves up to 10x faster training, 3x lower GPU memory usage, and outperforms QLoRA in stability, efficiency, and memory for quantized models.

Conclusion: OFTv2 is a highly efficient and practical alternative to OFT, with significant improvements in speed and resource usage.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

*Pantelis R. Vlachas, Konstantinos Vlachas, Eleni Chatzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLieNet introduces a framework for learning interpolated networks to handle parametric variability in dynamical systems, outperforming baselines in forecasting and capturing long-term dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric variability in dynamical systems leads to diverse model behaviors, challenging generalization across parameter regimes.

Method: PHLieNet learns a global mapping from parameter space to embeddings and a mapping from embeddings to weights of a dynamics propagation network, enabling smooth transitions across parameterized behaviors.

Result: PHLieNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in short-term forecasting and capturing long-term dynamical features like attractor statistics.

Conclusion: PHLieNet provides a unified model for diverse parameterizations, enhancing generalization in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

TL;DR: Symbolic regression aims to learn interpretable functions with small prediction errors by searching spaces of small expressions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to achieve interpretable functions with small prediction errors, beyond standard regression approaches.

Method: Systematic search in spaces of small symbolic expressions, leveraging their decomposable structure.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in accuracy, robustness, and recovering true underlying expressions.

Conclusion: Systematic search in small expression spaces is more effective for symbolic regression than traditional methods.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of perturbation-based explanations due to poor model behavior under specific perturbations and misaligned confidence estimates.

Method: Introduces ReCalX, a recalibration approach for models to enhance explanation quality without altering original predictions.

Result: Experiments show ReCalX improves explanation alignment with human perception and actual object locations.

Conclusion: ReCalX effectively enhances perturbation-based explanation reliability by improving model calibration under explainability-specific perturbations.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and coherent forecasting across temporal scales is vital for business decision-making but remains an open problem.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical architecture with specialized modules for different temporal aggregation levels, encoding average behavior in hidden layers.

Result: Validated on the M5 dataset, the architecture outperforms established methods like TSMixer.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses the challenge of coherent forecasting across temporal hierarchies.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse

several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of batch data on offline RL performance, proposing a theoretical link between data distribution and algorithm performance. It introduces UDG for unsupervised data generation, showing superior results over supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the out-of-distribution problem in offline RL by analyzing batch data's influence and improving performance through unsupervised data generation.

Method: Theoretical analysis of model-based offline RL optimization, followed by the development of UDG for unsupervised data generation and selection.

Result: UDG outperforms supervised data generation in task-agnostic settings, minimizing performance gaps.

Conclusion: Batch data distribution significantly affects offline RL performance; UDG offers a practical solution for improving it.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

TL;DR: CAAT-Net reduces tensor-parallel communication in LLMs by 50% without significant accuracy loss, improving training and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor-parallelism in LLMs requires heavy communication for activation synchronization, increasing bandwidth demands.

Method: Proposes CAAT-Net, a communication-aware architecture, with minor adjustments to avoid full activation synchronization.

Result: Achieves 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication for 1B and 7B parameter models, maintaining pretraining accuracy.

Conclusion: CAAT-Net effectively reduces communication overhead, enhancing training and inference performance for LLMs.

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for

with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop

*Mihnea Ghitu, Matthew Wicker, Vihari Piratla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to prevent models from relying on irrelevant features (shortcuts) by optimizing for explanation robustness and shortcut mitigation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by reducing misclassifications by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing models from relying on misleading or irrelevant features (shortcuts) is critical to avoid real-world harms, especially in domains like medical imaging and NLP. Current methods using feature salience annotations are unreliable.

Method: A simplified objective is introduced to simultaneously optimize for explanation robustness and shortcut mitigation, supported by theoretical justification.

Result: The method reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to state-of-the-art approaches and is validated across diverse experiments, including NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates shortcut learning and improves model reliability, with practical insights on annotation quality over quantity.

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

*A. A. Balinsky, A. D. Balinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to reuse a single calibration set, maintaining reliable uncertainty quantification in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ICP requires fresh calibration sets for each prediction, which is impractical. This work aims to reduce this need while preserving coverage guarantees.

Method: Combines e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to modify Markov's inequality, enabling single calibration set reuse. Validated on CIFAR-10 with a deep neural network.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of maintaining provable performance with reduced calibration needs, illustrated via CIFAR-10 case study.

Conclusion: The approach enhances practicality of conformal prediction by reusing calibration sets without compromising coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

*Christiaan Lamers, Ahmed Nabil Belbachir, Thomas Bäck, Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes lightweight generators using Singular Value Decomposition to reduce memory usage in continual learning, improving accuracy without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize memory footprint while effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.

Method: Uses Singular Value Decomposition-based generators to enhance existing methods like A-GEM and Experience Replay, requiring minimal memory and no training.

Result: Significant increase in average accuracy compared to original methods, with minimal memory usage.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces memory requirements for memory-based continual learning algorithms while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

*Alberto Pirillo, Luca Colombo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReBoot is the first framework for fully encrypted and non-interactive training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using Homomorphic Encryption (HE), achieving accuracy comparable to plaintext training while enhancing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for deep learning methods that protect sensitive data during training, overcoming the computational and algorithmic challenges of HE-based DNN training.

Method: ReBoot introduces a HE-compliant neural network architecture with local error signals, tailored packing for SIMD operations, and approximate bootstrapping to minimize overhead and noise.

Result: ReBoot achieves accuracy close to plaintext training, improves test accuracy over existing encrypted methods, and reduces training latency significantly.

Conclusion: ReBoot enables practical, fully encrypted DNN training with strong privacy guarantees, making it suitable for machine learning-as-a-service.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

*Nathan Maurer, Harshal Kaushik, Roshni Anna Jacob, Jie Zhang, Souma Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based method using reinforcement learning and bigraph matching optimizes resource allocation for restoring critical infrastructure networks after disruptions, outperforming random and optimization-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the combinatorial challenge of efficiently allocating restoration resources (crews and tasks) in disrupted critical infrastructure networks (CINs) to maximize resilience.

Method: Combines graph reinforcement learning (GRL) with bigraph matching, using a heterogeneous graph to represent crews, transportation, and power grid nodes. Two learning techniques (Proximal Policy Optimization and Neuroevolution) train incentive functions for crew-task assignments.

Result: The approach generalizes and scales across scenarios, achieving 3-fold better performance than random policies and outperforming optimization-based solutions in computation time and power restored.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances speed and functionality in CIN restoration, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat, Tobias Vontobel, Farnood Salehi, Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classifier-free guidance (CFG) in diffusion models, revealing its distinct impacts on low and high frequencies. It proposes frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG) to improve quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG enhances diffusion models but lacks understanding of its mechanisms, especially in the frequency domain.

Method: Analyzes CFG's frequency effects, proposes FDG to decouple and separately scale low- and high-frequency guidance.

Result: FDG improves image quality, avoids oversaturation, and preserves diversity, outperforming CFG in FID and recall.

Conclusion: FDG is a superior plug-and-play alternative to CFG, enhancing fidelity and diversity in diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAP introduces a variational framework using von Mises-Fisher distributions to model weight uncertainties on the unit hypersphere, improving neural network calibration with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing variational inference methods use isotropic Gaussian approximations, which poorly match neural networks' geometry, necessitating a better approach for uncertainty quantification.

Method: CAP employs von Mises-Fisher distributions for weight uncertainties, linking concentration parameters to activation noise variance via a closed-form KL divergence regularizer.

Result: CAP reduces Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x on CIFAR-10 and provides interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles.

Conclusion: CAP offers a theoretically grounded, practical solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSA is a game-theoretic framework for quantifying neural unit contributions in large models, revealing insights like computation hubs and language-specific experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SHAP fail to quantify neural unit contributions across high-dimensional outputs, creating a need for a scalable solution.

Method: Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA) systematically lesions unit combinations to produce Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps matching output dimensionality.

Result: MSA identifies computation hubs, language-specific experts in LLMs, and an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.

Conclusion: MSA is a powerful tool for interpreting, editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

*Ben Keslaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT is a preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational analysis to extract salient data features, improving training stability and generalization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in deep learning lies in input preparation; DRIFT addresses this by focusing on minimal, salient, and structured data representation.

Method: DRIFT projects data onto a low-dimensional basis using spatial vibration mode shapes, reducing input dimensions while preserving essential patterns.

Result: DRIFT achieves competitive accuracy with fewer features (~50 for MNIST, <100 for CIFAR100) and outperforms pixel-based models and PCA in stability and robustness.

Conclusion: DRIFT highlights the importance of input curation and physics-driven transformations for enhancing deep learning performance.

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

*Yihong Luo, Shuchen Xue, Tianyang Hu, Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noise Consistency Training (NCT) is introduced to integrate control signals into pre-trained one-step generators efficiently, without retraining or original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adapting one-step generators to new control conditions without costly modifications.

Method: NCT uses an adapter module and noise consistency loss to align generation behavior with new controls.

Result: NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: NCT is a modular, data-efficient, and deployable solution for controllable content generation.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

TL;DR: Cross-regularization automates regularization tuning by using validation gradients during training, balancing feature learning and complexity control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of regularization is time-consuming and suboptimal; cross-regularization aims to automate this process efficiently.

Method: Splits parameter optimization: training data guides feature learning, while validation data shapes regularization. Uses noise injection in neural networks.

Result: Achieves provable convergence to cross-validation optima, reveals high noise tolerance, and architecture-specific regularization.

Conclusion: The framework is efficient, integrates with data augmentation and uncertainty calibration, and maintains single-run training simplicity.

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, a framework extending Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to handle multiple human preference dimensions dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques like RLHF are computationally intensive and inflexible, while DPO assumes a single static preference distribution, limiting adaptability.

Method: Proposes a novel framework incorporating multiple preference dimensions and dynamic interpolation via a controllable simplex-weighted formulation, supporting listwise feedback.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis shows the method matches DPO's effectiveness on static objectives while offering greater flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework provides a lightweight, stable, and adaptable solution for aligning language models with diverse and dynamic human preferences.

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: A new adaptive weighting scheme for PINNs improves accuracy by adjusting loss function weights from points to neighborhoods, reducing relative L² errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs face challenges in convergence and accuracy due to finite point optimization.

Method: Proposed an adaptive weighting scheme for loss functions, transitioning from isolated points to continuous neighborhoods.

Result: Empirical results show reduced relative L² errors.

Conclusion: The adaptive weighting scheme enhances PINN performance in solving PDEs.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning language models on insecure code leads to emergent misalignment, where models exhibit malicious behavior. This study explores diverse conditions causing misalignment and uses model diffing to identify toxic persona features. Mitigation is possible with minimal benign fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models generalize behaviors from training to deployment, particularly focusing on emergent misalignment caused by fine-tuning on insecure data.

Method: Investigates emergent misalignment across various conditions (reinforcement learning, synthetic datasets, no safety training) and uses sparse autoencoders for model diffing to analyze internal representations.

Result: Identifies 'misaligned persona' features, especially a toxic persona feature controlling misalignment. Shows that fine-tuning on a few hundred benign samples can restore alignment.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment is a significant issue, but targeted mitigation strategies can effectively address it.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'ambiguous online learning,' where learners can predict multiple labels, with correctness defined by at least one correct label and no 'predictably wrong' labels. The setting applies to multivalued systems, recommendation algorithms, and lossless compression, showing a trichotomy of mistake bounds: Θ(1), Θ(√N), or N.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where learners benefit from predicting multiple labels, particularly in multivalued dynamical systems, recommendation algorithms, and lossless compression, while defining correctness more flexibly.

Method: Introduces 'ambiguous online learning,' allowing multiple predicted labels, with correctness based on at least one correct label and no 'predictably wrong' labels (defined by a hypothesis class).

Result: Demonstrates a trichotomy of mistake bounds for any hypothesis class: Θ(1), Θ(√N), or N (up to logarithmic factors).

Conclusion: The ambiguous online learning framework is versatile for multivalued systems and reveals a clear trichotomy in mistake bounds, offering theoretical insights for practical applications.

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class

### [351] [Curating art exhibitions using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19813)
*Eurico Covas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI models mimic human art curators using machine learning on past exhibitions, achieving reasonable accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AI can replicate the subjective curatorial work of human experts by learning from past exhibitions.

Method: Four machine learning models trained on 25 years of Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibitions, focusing on feature engineering and model architecture.

Result: Models replicate past exhibitions with accuracy above random, showing potential with modest-sized models.

Conclusion: AI can mimic human curators; with more data, it could approach human aesthetic judgment.

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

*Hongyi Liu, Rajarshi Saha, Zhen Jia, Youngsuk Park, Jiaji Huang, Shoham Sabach, Yu-Xiang Wang, George Karypis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProxSparse is a learning-based framework for semi-structured pruning of LLMs, outperforming existing methods by leveraging global feedback and regularized optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency and high cost of serving large LLMs due to their massive size necessitate better pruning methods. Existing approaches are suboptimal as they rely on local, heuristic-based optimizations.

Method: ProxSparse transforms the rigid, non-differentiable mask selection into a smoother optimization process, enabling gradual mask exploration without additional weight updates post-mask determination.

Result: Evaluations on 7 widely used models show ProxSparse consistently outperforms existing semi-structured pruning methods.

Conclusion: ProxSparse demonstrates the effectiveness of a learned approach for semi-structured pruning, offering significant improvements over prior methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
natural language processing tasks, yet their massive size makes serving them
inefficient and costly. Semi-structured pruning has emerged as an effective
method for model acceleration, but existing approaches are suboptimal because
they focus on local, layer-wise optimizations using heuristic rules, failing to
leverage global feedback. We present ProxSparse, a learning-based framework for
mask selection enabled by regularized optimization. ProxSparse transforms the
rigid, non-differentiable mask selection process into a smoother optimization
procedure, allowing gradual mask exploration with flexibility. ProxSparse does
not involve additional weight updates once the mask is determined. Our
extensive evaluations on 7 widely used models show that ProxSparse consistently
outperforms previously proposed semi-structured mask selection methods with
significant improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our learned
approach towards semi-structured pruning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThinkPRM is a generative, long CoT verifier that outperforms baselines with minimal supervision, scaling test-time compute efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build data-efficient PRMs by leveraging verbalized step-wise reward models, reducing the need for expensive step-level supervision.

Method: Fine-tuning long CoT models to generate verification chains-of-thought, using far fewer process labels than discriminative PRMs.

Result: ThinkPRM outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers on benchmarks like ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24, even with 1% of PRM800K labels.

Conclusion: Generative, long CoT PRMs like ThinkPRM offer efficient verification scaling with minimal training supervision.

Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a
key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision,
making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as
verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by
generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long
CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those
required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent
reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and
discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K --
across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the
baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and
reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of
GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers
trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the
same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively
compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of
ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that
can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal
supervision for training. Our code, data, and models will be released at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-IMM is a dataset for irregular multimodal time series, addressing real-world challenges like varying sampling rates and missing data. IMM-TSF is a benchmark library for forecasting on such data, showing performance gains with explicit multimodality modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assume clean, regular data, which doesn't reflect real-world irregularity. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF aim to bridge this gap.

Method: Time-IMM categorizes irregularity into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. IMM-TSF includes fusion modules for asynchronous integration and evaluation.

Result: Explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular data improves forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide tools for realistic time series analysis, advancing research under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the
benchmark library can be accessed at

### [355] [ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18631)
*Chenxing Wei, Jiarui Yu, Ying Tiffany He, Hande Dong, Yao Shu, Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReDit (Reward Dithering) enhances LLM training by adding random noise to discrete rewards, improving gradient stability and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete rewards in rule-based systems like DeepSeek-R1 cause gradient anomalies and slow convergence.

Method: ReDit introduces random noise to discrete rewards, providing smoother gradients and encouraging exploration.

Result: ReDit matches vanilla GRPO performance in 10% of the training steps and improves performance by 4% with similar training duration.

Conclusion: ReDit effectively mitigates gradient issues and accelerates convergence, validated by experiments and theory.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

*Lingkai Kong, Wenhao Mu, Jiaming Cui, Yuchen Zhuang, B. Aditya Prakash, Bo Dai, Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DF2 is a distribution-free decision-focused learning method addressing model mismatch, sample average approximation, and gradient approximation errors by directly learning the expected optimization function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the three major bottlenecks in decision-focused learning (DFL) under probabilistic settings: model mismatch error, sample average approximation error, and gradient approximation error.

Method: DF2 uses an attention-based model architecture to directly learn the expected optimization function, avoiding reliance on task-specific forecasters.

Result: DF2 is evaluated on synthetic and real-world problems, showing effectiveness in mitigating the three bottlenecks.

Conclusion: DF2 provides a robust, distribution-free approach for decision-focused learning, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL), which differentiates through the KKT
conditions, has recently emerged as a powerful approach for
predict-then-optimize problems. However, under probabilistic settings, DFL
faces three major bottlenecks: model mismatch error, sample average
approximation error, and gradient approximation error. Model mismatch error
stems from the misalignment between the model's parameterized predictive
distribution and the true probability distribution. Sample average
approximation error arises when using finite samples to approximate the
expected optimization objective. Gradient approximation error occurs when the
objectives are non-convex and KKT conditions cannot be directly applied. In
this paper, we present DF2, the first distribution-free decision-focused
learning method designed to mitigate these three bottlenecks. Rather than
depending on a task-specific forecaster that requires precise model
assumptions, our method directly learns the expected optimization function
during training. To efficiently learn this function in a data-driven manner, we
devise an attention-based model architecture inspired by the distribution-based
parameterization of the expected objective. We evaluate DF2 on two synthetic
problems and three real-world problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of DF2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance trade-offs in self-attributing neural networks (SANNs) and enhance interpretability.

Method: Proposes Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a framework converting differentiable models into group-based SANNs, learning feature groups end-to-end.

Result: SOP achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision and language tasks, with interpretable groups validated by metrics.

Conclusion: SOP improves SANNs' performance and interpretability, useful for model debugging and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Self-attributing neural networks (SANNs) present a potential path towards
interpretable models for high-dimensional problems, but often face significant
trade-offs in performance. In this work, we formally prove a lower bound on
errors of per-feature SANNs, whereas group-based SANNs can achieve zero error
and thus high performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose Sum-of-Parts
(SOP), a framework that transforms any differentiable model into a group-based
SANN, where feature groups are learned end-to-end without group supervision.
SOP achieves state-of-the-art performance for SANNs on vision and language
tasks, and we validate that the groups are interpretable on a range of
quantitative and semantic metrics. We further validate the utility of SOP
explanations in model debugging and cosmological scientific discovery. Our code
is available at https://github.com/BrachioLab/sop

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the transformative potential of differentiable programming in AI, leveraging large models, datasets, and hardware advancements.

Method: Adopts optimization and probability perspectives, emphasizing thoughtful program design for differentiation and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Highlights the integration of automatic differentiation, graphical models, and statistics into differentiable programming.

Conclusion: Differentiable programming extends beyond differentiation, incorporating probabilistic execution to quantify output uncertainty.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled
by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least,
the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming
paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs
(including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based
optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm,
differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and
applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models,
optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the
fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main
perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear
analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the
differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs
intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently
introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to
quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.

Motivation: To bridge methodological innovation with psychiatric utility by comprehensively analyzing MML's role in mental-health disorder detection and monitoring.

Method: Cataloged 26 datasets and systematically compared 28 models (transformer, graph, hybrid-based fusion) for representation learning and cross-modal alignment.

Result: Highlights trends in MML for mental health, emphasizing the need for trustworthy, multimodal decision-support systems.

Conclusion: The survey aims to guide ML researchers and mental-health practitioners toward addressing open challenges like data governance, fairness, and explainability.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning (MML) is rapidly reshaping the way mental-health
disorders are detected, characterized, and longitudinally monitored. Whereas
early studies relied on isolated data streams -- such as speech, text, or
wearable signals -- recent research has converged on architectures that
integrate heterogeneous modalities to capture the rich, complex signatures of
psychiatric conditions. This survey provides the first comprehensive,
clinically grounded synthesis of MML for mental health. We (i) catalog 26
public datasets spanning audio, visual, physiological signals, and text
modalities; (ii) systematically compare transformer, graph, and hybrid-based
fusion strategies across 28 models, highlighting trends in representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Beyond summarizing current capabilities, we
interrogate open challenges: data governance and privacy, demographic and
intersectional fairness, evaluation explainability, and the complexity of
mental health disorders in multimodal settings. By bridging methodological
innovation with psychiatric utility, this survey aims to orient both ML
researchers and mental-health practitioners toward the next generation of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for global healthcare modeling using federated learning and blockchain ensures privacy while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data sharing is challenging due to privacy and heterogeneity; a solution is needed for global collaboration without compromising data security.

Method: Blockchain-enabled federated learning with an incentive mechanism for honest participation and penalization of malicious activities.

Result: The framework is effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving, outperforming limited personal data models and matching centralized training in some cases.

Conclusion: The work enables international healthcare collaborations, reducing bias and enhancing benefits while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of building artificial intelligence (AI) model
in the healthcare area is the data sharing. Since healthcare data is private,
sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is
exhausting, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a
framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents
(Europe, North America, and Asia) without sharing the local datasets, and
choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness.
Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with
adaptation to meet the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data,
meanwhile, it rewards honest participation and penalizes malicious activities
using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving. Its
prediction accuracy consistently outperforms models trained on limited personal
data and achieves comparable or even slightly better results than centralized
training in certain scenarios, all while preserving data privacy. This work
paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where
additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to
humanity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the ubiquitous residual connections in deep learning architectures for better performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduces Learned Augmented Residual Layer (LAuReL) as a replacement for traditional residual connections, tested on vision and language models.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains (e.g., 60% of extra layer gains in ResNet-50) with minimal parameter addition (e.g., 0.003%).

Conclusion: LAuReL is a highly efficient and effective replacement for residual connections, enhancing model performance across tasks.

Abstract: One of the core pillars of efficient deep learning methods is architectural
improvements such as the residual/skip connection, which has led to
significantly better model convergence and quality. Since then the residual
connection has become ubiquitous in not just convolutional neural networks but
also transformer-based architectures, the backbone of LLMs.
  In this paper we introduce Learned Augmented Residual Layer (LAuReL) -- a
novel generalization of the canonical residual connection -- with the goal to
be an in-situ replacement of the latter while outperforming on both model
quality and footprint metrics. Our experiments show that using LAuReL can help
boost performance for both vision and language models. For example, on the
ResNet-50, ImageNet 1K task, it achieves 60% of the gains from adding an extra
layer, while only adding 0.003% more parameters, and matches it while adding
2.6 times fewer parameters. Similarly, when pre-training 1B and 4B parameter
LLMs, LAuReL improves performance on a variety of challenging downstream
evaluation tasks by 2.54% to 20.05%, while adding only 0.012% and 0.1%
additional parameters, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying MoE models on memory-constrained devices is challenging due to limited DRAM capacity, especially for sequential token generation.

Method: Introduces a cache-aware routing strategy to leverage expert reuse, enhancing cache locality.

Result: Achieves 2× speedups on mobile devices in benchmarks like language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K.

Conclusion: Provides a training-free solution to make MoE models more practical for real-world applications on constrained devices.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their
ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks
or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained
devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially
with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings
involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on
memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM.
We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse
during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on
language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results
demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible,
training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world
applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce novel Twin Parametric Margin Support Vector
Machine (TPMSVM) models designed to address multiclass classification tasks
under feature uncertainty. To handle data perturbations, we construct
bounded-by-norm uncertainty set around each training observation and derive the
robust counterparts of the deterministic models using robust optimization
techniques. To capture complex data structure, we explore both linear and
kernel-induced classifiers, providing computationally tractable reformulations
of the resulting robust models. Additionally, we propose two alternatives for

validate the effectiveness of the proposed robust multiclass TPMSVM methodology
on real-world datasets, showing the good performance of the approach in the

TL;DR: A method for generating synthetic data that mimics inter-feature correlations in the original dataset, with tunable privacy levels via conditional distribution depth limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties of the original data while allowing adjustable privacy controls.

Method: Constructs a statistical map using empirical conditional distributions between features, with tunable depth for privacy. Algorithms for map construction and synthetic data generation are detailed.

Result: Tested on hand-calculated, manufactured, and real-world datasets (energy consumption/production in Madeira). Evaluated using Pearson correlation matrices with varying resolutions and correlation depths.

Conclusion: The method is general and applicable beyond the tested datasets, offering a balance between data fidelity and privacy.

Abstract: We propose a method to generate statistically representative synthetic data
from a given dataset. The main goal of our method is for the created data set
to mimic the inter--feature correlations present in the original data, while
also offering a tunable parameter to influence the privacy level. In
particular, our method constructs a statistical map by using the empirical
conditional distributions between the features of the original dataset. Part of
the tunability is achieved by limiting the depths of conditional distributions
that are being used. We describe in detail our algorithms used both in the
construction of a statistical map and how to use this map to generate synthetic
observations. This approach is tested in three different ways: with a hand
calculated example; a manufactured dataset; and a real world energy-related
dataset of consumption/production of households in Madeira Island. We evaluate
the method by comparing the datasets using the Pearson correlation matrix with
different levels of resolution and depths of correlation. These two
considerations are being viewed as tunable parameters influencing the resulting
datasets fidelity and privacy. The proposed methodology is general in the sense
that it does not rely on the used test dataset. We expect it to be applicable
in a much broader context than indicated here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the approximation of high-dimensional functions by focusing on low-order interactions and improving interpretability.

Method: Utilizes classical and generalized ANOVA decomposition to identify important variables and interactions, generalizing random Fourier feature models for ANOVA settings.

Result: Algorithms reliably identify key variables and interactions, reducing approximation error significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve interpretability and performance in sensitivity analysis and function approximation.

Abstract: We propose two algorithms for boosting random Fourier feature models for
approximating high-dimensional functions. These methods utilize the classical
and generalized analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition to learn low-order
functions, where there are few interactions between the variables. Our
algorithms are able to find an index set of important input variables and
variable interactions reliably. Furthermore, we generalize already existing
random Fourier feature models to an ANOVA setting, where terms of different
order can be used. Our algorithms have the advantage of interpretability,
meaning that the influence of every input variable is known in the learned
model, even for dependent input variables. We give theoretical as well as
numerical results that our algorithms perform well for sensitivity analysis.
The ANOVA-boosting step reduces the approximation error of existing methods
significantly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphical models face limitations due to data randomness and real-world complexities, prompting the need for tailored UQ techniques.

Method: Comprehensive review of existing UQ works, organized by uncertainty representation and handling.

Result: Identifies gaps and opportunities in UQ for graphical models, aiming to inspire advancements.

Conclusion: The survey bridges understanding of UQ challenges in graphical models, encouraging cross-field research.

Abstract: Graphical models have demonstrated their exceptional capabilities across
numerous applications, such as social networks, citation networks, and online
recommendation systems. However, their performance, confidence, and
trustworthiness are often limited by the inherent randomness in data and the
challenges of accurately modeling real-world complexities. There has been
increased interest in developing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques
tailored to graphical models. In this survey, we comprehensively examine
existing works on UQ for graphical models, focusing on key aspects such as the
sources, representation, handling, and evaluation of uncertainty. This survey
distinguishes itself from most existing UQ surveys by specifically
concentrating on UQ in graphical models, including probabilistic graphical
models (PGMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). After reviewing sources of
uncertainty, we organize the work using two high-level dimensions: uncertainty
representation and uncertainty handling. By offering a comprehensive overview
of the current landscape, including both established methodologies and emerging
trends, we aim to bridge gaps in understanding key challenges and opportunities
in UQ for graphical models, hoping to inspire researchers working on graphical
models or uncertainty quantification to make further advancements at the cross
of the two fields.

Conclusion: The asymmetric graph-learning framework of HeNCler is advantageous for heterophilous node clustering.

Abstract: Clustering nodes in heterophilous graphs is challenging as traditional
methods assume that effective clustering is characterized by high intra-cluster
and low inter-cluster connectivity. To address this, we introduce HeNCler-a
novel approach for Heterophilous Node Clustering. HeNCler learns a similarity
graph by optimizing a clustering-specific objective based on weighted kernel
singular value decomposition. Our approach enables spectral clustering on an
asymmetric similarity graph, providing flexibility for both directed and
undirected graphs. By solving the primal problem directly, our method overcomes
the computational difficulties of traditional adjacency partitioning-based
approaches. Experimental results show that HeNCler significantly improves node
clustering performance in heterophilous graph settings, highlighting the
advantage of its asymmetric graph-learning framework.

### [368] [Towards Unsupervised Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Task-Agnostic Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08365)
*Riccardo Zamboni, Mirco Mutti, Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores unsupervised pre-training in multi-agent reinforcement learning, proposing a scalable algorithm and validating its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of understanding in multi-agent settings for unsupervised pre-training, despite its real-world ubiquity, motivates this study.

Method: A decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm is introduced to tackle the problem practically.

Result: Numerical validations show that optimizing for mixture entropy offers a balance between tractability and performance.

Conclusion: The study advances unsupervised multi-agent reinforcement learning by addressing theoretical and practical challenges.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to unsupervised pre-training
when we aim to pre-train a policy without a priori access to the task
specification, i.e. rewards, to be later employed for efficient learning of
downstream tasks. In single-agent settings, the problem has been extensively
studied and mostly understood. A popular approach, called task-agnostic
exploration, casts the unsupervised objective as maximizing the entropy of the
state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and
methods follow.
  In contrast, little is known about it in multi-agent settings, which are
ubiquitous in the real world. What are the pros and cons of alternative problem
formulations in this setting? How hard is the problem in theory, how can we
solve it in practice? In this paper, we address these questions by first
characterizing those alternative formulations and highlighting how the problem,
even when tractable in theory, is non-trivial in practice. Then, we present a
scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the
problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide numerical validations to
both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for unsupervised
multi-agent reinforcement learning via task-agnostic exploration in challenging
domains, showing that optimizing for a specific objective, namely mixture
entropy, provides an excellent trade-off between tractability and performances.

*Peter A. Wijeratne, Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast, scalable method for disease progression modeling using optimal transport, enabling high-dimensional feature analysis and improved clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional disease progression models face computational limitations due to combinatoric explosion, restricting their dimensionality and practical use.

Method: The authors model disease progression as a latent permutation matrix within the Birkhoff polytope, leveraging optimal transport for efficient variational inference.

Result: The method achieves 1000x faster inference, handles more features, and demonstrates accuracy and noise robustness in simulations and real-world datasets (Alzheimer's and macular degeneration).

Conclusion: The approach is computationally efficient, interpretable, and broadly applicable to progressive conditions, offering significant clinical potential.

Abstract: Disease progression models infer group-level temporal trajectories of change
in patients' features as a chronic degenerative condition plays out. They
provide unique insight into disease biology and staging systems with
individual-level clinical utility. Discrete models consider disease progression
as a latent permutation of events, where each event corresponds to a feature
becoming measurably abnormal. However, permutation inference using traditional
maximum likelihood approaches becomes prohibitive due to combinatoric
explosion, severely limiting model dimensionality and utility. Here we leverage
ideas from optimal transport to model disease progression as a latent
permutation matrix of events belonging to the Birkhoff polytope, facilitating
fast inference via optimisation of the variational lower bound. This enables a
factor of 1000 times faster inference than the current state of the art and,
correspondingly, supports models with several orders of magnitude more features
than the current state of the art can consider. Experiments demonstrate the
increase in speed, accuracy and robustness to noise in simulation. Further
experiments with real-world imaging data from two separate datasets, one from
Alzheimer's disease patients, the other age-related macular degeneration,
showcase, for the first time, pixel-level disease progression events in the
brain and eye, respectively. Our method is low compute, interpretable and
applicable to any progressive condition and data modality, giving it broad
potential clinical utility.

*Jesse He, Helen Jenne, Herman Chau, Davis Brown, Mark Raugas, Sara Billey, Henry Kvinge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses graph neural networks to study quiver mutation in cluster algebras, discovering mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $	ilde{D}$ and demonstrating the model's ability to learn abstract mathematical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage machine learning for identifying patterns in quiver mutation, a key operation in cluster algebras with broad mathematical and physical implications.

Method: Graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques are employed to analyze quiver mutation and discover equivalence criteria.

Result: The model independently discovers mutation equivalence criteria for $	ilde{D}$ quivers and captures hidden structure to reconstruct known criteria for type $D$ quivers.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can learn abstract mathematical rules, as evidenced by the model's ability to uncover and reconstruct quiver mutation criteria.

Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics,
enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast
that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and
analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver
mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph)
into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep
connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster
algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental
concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be
transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we
use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently
discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along
the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model
captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to
reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that
modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and
parsimonious rules from mathematical data.

*Dahun Shin, Dongyeop Lee, Jinseok Chung, Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sassha, a new second-order optimization method, improves generalization by minimizing sharpness and stabilizing Hessian computations, outperforming existing methods in deep learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order methods often generalize worse than first-order methods due to converging to sharper minima.

Method: Proposes Sassha, which reduces solution sharpness and stabilizes approximate Hessian computations, even with lazy updates.

Result: Sassha achieves superior generalization, often outperforming other methods in deep learning experiments.

Conclusion: Sassha effectively balances flatness and efficiency, proving robust and stable in various analyses.

Abstract: Approximate second-order optimization methods often exhibit poorer
generalization compared to first-order approaches. In this work, we look into
this issue through the lens of the loss landscape and find that existing
second-order methods tend to converge to sharper minima compared to SGD. In
response, we propose Sassha, a novel second-order method designed to enhance
generalization by explicitly reducing sharpness of the solution, while
stabilizing the computation of approximate Hessians along the optimization
trajectory. In fact, this sharpness minimization scheme is crafted also to
accommodate lazy Hessian updates, so as to secure efficiency besides flatness.
To validate its effectiveness, we conduct a wide range of standard deep
learning experiments where Sassha demonstrates its outstanding generalization
performance that is comparable to, and mostly better than, other methods. We
provide a comprehensive set of analyses including convergence, robustness,
stability, efficiency, and cost.

*Margaux Tornqvist, Jean-Daniel Zucker, Tristan Fauvel, Nicolas Lambert, Mathilde Berthelot, Antoine Movschin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate synthetic patient data without needing original data, using LLMs and prior medical knowledge, and evaluates its performance against traditional SDG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access to high-quality healthcare data is limited by privacy, sharing restrictions, and costs. Synthetic data offers a solution, but current methods require original data, which is scarce.

Method: The approach uses large language models (LLMs) and prior medical knowledge to generate synthetic tabular patient data based on a database description, without accessing original data.

Result: LLMs generate realistic patient data with preserved clinical correlations, though they don't outperform state-of-the-art models trained on original data. The method is easy to use and effective in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method is valuable for quickly generating custom patient data, supporting projects and education, without requiring original data or advanced ML skills.

Abstract: Access to large-scale high-quality healthcare databases is key to accelerate
medical research and make insightful discoveries about diseases. However,
access to such data is often limited by patient privacy concerns, data sharing
restrictions and high costs. To overcome these limitations, synthetic patient
data has emerged as an alternative. However, synthetic data generation (SDG)
methods typically rely on machine learning (ML) models trained on original
data, leading back to the data scarcity problem. We propose an approach to
generate synthetic tabular patient data that does not require access to the
original data, but only a description of the desired database. We leverage
prior medical knowledge and in-context learning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to generate realistic patient data, even in a low-resource
setting. We quantitatively evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art SDG
models, using fidelity, privacy, and utility metrics. Our results show that
while LLMs may not match the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on
the original data, they effectively generate realistic patient data with
well-preserved clinical correlations. An ablation study highlights key elements
of our prompt contributing to high-quality synthetic patient data generation.
This approach, which is easy to use and does not require original data or
advanced ML skills, is particularly valuable for quickly generating
custom-designed patient data, supporting project implementation and providing
educational resources.

### [373] [DecDEC: A Systems Approach to Advancing Low-Bit LLM Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20185)
*Yeonhong Park, Jake Hyun, Hojoon Kim, Jae W. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecDEC improves low-bit LLM quality by dynamically fetching residuals for salient channels, reducing perplexity with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization degrades LLM quality in low-bit settings; DecDEC aims to preserve efficiency while improving accuracy.

Method: Stores residual matrix in CPU, dynamically fetches residuals for salient channels identified by activation outliers.

Result: Reduces perplexity in 3-bit models (e.g., 10.15 to 9.12) with negligible GPU memory and latency impact.

Conclusion: DecDEC effectively balances quantization benefits with improved model quality, adaptable to dynamic activations.

Abstract: Quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently gained popularity,
particularly for on-device settings with limited hardware resources. While
efficient, quantization inevitably degrades model quality, especially in
aggressive low-bit settings such as 3-bit and 4-bit precision. In this paper,
we propose DecDEC, an inference scheme that improves the quality of low-bit
LLMs while preserving the key benefits of quantization: GPU memory savings and
latency reduction. DecDEC stores the residual matrix -- the difference between
full-precision and quantized weights -- in CPU, and dynamically fetches the
residuals for only a small portion of the weights. This portion corresponds to
the salient channels, marked by activation outliers, with the fetched residuals
helping to correct quantization errors in these channels. Salient channels are
identified dynamically at each decoding step by analyzing the input activations
-- this enables adaptation to the dynamic nature of activation distribution,
thus maximizing the effectiveness of error compensation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of DecDEC by augmenting state-of-the-art quantization methods.
For example, DecDEC reduces the perplexity of a 3-bit Llama-3-8B-Instruct model
from 10.15 to 9.12 -- outperforming its 3.5-bit counterpart -- while adding
less than 0.0003\% to GPU memory usage and incurring only a 1.7\% inference
slowdown on NVIDIA RTX 4050 Mobile.

*Shadab Ahamed, Niloufar Zakariaei, Eldad Haber, Moshe Eliasof*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multiscale Gradient Estimation (MGE) and Full-Multiscale training to reduce CNN training costs on high-resolution images without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image training is computationally expensive due to fine mesh gradient evaluations.

Method: MGE uses a telescopic sum of gradients on coarser meshes, while Full-Multiscale starts training on coarse meshes first.

Result: Reduces computation costs by 4-16x with no significant performance loss.

Conclusion: MGE and Full-Multiscale provide a scalable, architecture-agnostic solution for efficient CNN training.

Abstract: Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on high-resolution images is
often bottlenecked by the cost of evaluating gradients of the loss on the
finest spatial mesh. To address this, we propose Multiscale Gradient Estimation
(MGE), a Multilevel Monte Carlo-inspired estimator that expresses the expected
gradient on the finest mesh as a telescopic sum of gradients computed on
progressively coarser meshes. By assigning larger batches to the cheaper coarse
levels, MGE achieves the same variance as single-scale stochastic gradient
estimation while reducing the number of fine mesh convolutions by a factor of 4
with each downsampling. We further embed MGE within a Full-Multiscale training
algorithm that solves the learning problem on coarse meshes first and
"hot-starts" the next finer level, cutting the required fine mesh iterations by
an additional order of magnitude. Extensive experiments on image denoising,
deblurring, inpainting and super-resolution tasks using UNet, ResNet and ESPCN
backbones confirm the practical benefits: Full-Multiscale reduces the
computation costs by 4-16$\times$ with no significant loss in performance.
Together, MGE and Full-Multiscale offer a principled, architecture-agnostic
route to accelerate CNN training on high-resolution data without sacrificing
accuracy, and they can be combined with other variance-reduction or
learning-rate schedules to further enhance scalability.

*Sagi Meir, Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni, Barak Hirshberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a first-passage approach to optimize perturbations in machine learning training protocols, demonstrating its effectiveness across datasets, architectures, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training machine learning models is time-consuming, and existing perturbation methods lack systematic optimization.

Method: Framing training protocols as first-passage processes and analyzing their response to perturbations.

Result: A single perturbation frequency can predict behavior across a wide range, validated on CIFAR-10 and other tasks.

Conclusion: The approach enables rational optimization of perturbations for improved training efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications
across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly
exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to
perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and
perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these
perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved
generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad
hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training
protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response
to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a
quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict
the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a
CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful
perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. We demonstrate the
transferability of the approach to other datasets, architectures, optimizers
and even tasks (regression instead of classification). Our work allows
optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning
models using a first-passage approach.

*Ayush K. Varshney, Vicenç Torra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for machine unlearning in generative models, treating forget samples as out-of-distribution data, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods for generative models are limited, especially for image-to-image models, and current approaches like minimizing Gaussian noise distance are insufficient.

Method: The framework decouples model parameters using gradient ascent to ensure forget samples are out-of-distribution, with fine-tuning on remaining data and an attack model for validation.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ImageNet-1K and Places365 shows superiority, and comparison on CIFAR-10 demonstrates performance comparable to retrained models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively removes forget samples' influence while maintaining model performance, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained
machine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security.
However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather
limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model)
considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I
model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the
machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained
model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not
generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we
consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer
recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To
achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with
gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with
theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning
guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is
further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We
also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively
removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two
large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of
our approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show
the comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10
dataset.

*Alireza Kazemipour, Simone Parisi, Matthew E. Taylor, Michael Bowling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-based algorithm for Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs) to address limitations of existing methods, demonstrating faster convergence and providing finite-sample guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mon-MDP algorithms fail to fully exploit problem structure, lack guarantees for unsolvable cases, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs.

Method: A model-based algorithm using two instances of model-based interval estimation: one for capturing observable rewards and another for learning the minimax-optimal policy.

Result: Faster convergence in benchmarks, especially with known monitoring processes, and finite-sample performance bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods, ensuring minimax-optimal policies even with unobservable rewards.

Abstract: A tenet of reinforcement learning is that the agent always observes rewards.
However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer
may not always be available to provide rewards, sensors may be limited or
malfunctioning, or rewards may be inaccessible during deployment. Monitored
Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed to model such
settings. However, existing Mon-MDP algorithms have several limitations: they
do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot leverage a known monitor,
lack worst-case guarantees for 'unsolvable' Mon-MDPs without specific
initialization, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs. This paper makes
three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs
that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm employs two instances of
model-based interval estimation: one to ensure that observable rewards are
reliably captured, and another to learn the minimax-optimal policy. Second, we
empirically demonstrate the advantages. We show faster convergence than prior
algorithms in over four dozen benchmarks, and even more dramatic improvement
when the monitoring process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample
bound on performance. We show convergence to a minimax-optimal policy even when
some rewards are never observable.

Motivation: To address the need for better alignment between neural network architecture and activation functions for effective representation and learning, especially for high-frequency components.

Method: Proposes the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) with a scaled random initialization method for the first layer's weights.

Result: FMMNNs exhibit exponential expressive power, favorable optimization landscapes, and outperform traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: FMMNNs are a highly effective and flexible solution for modeling high-frequency features, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network and the selection of its activation
function are both fundamental to its performance. Equally vital is ensuring
these two elements are well-matched, as their alignment is key to achieving
effective representation and learning. In this paper, we introduce the Fourier
Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN), a novel model that
creates a strong synergy between them. We demonstrate that FMMNNs are highly
effective and flexible in modeling high-frequency components. Our theoretical
results demonstrate that FMMNNs have exponential expressive power for function
approximation. We also analyze the optimization landscape of FMMNNs and find it
to be much more favorable than that of standard fully connected neural
networks, especially when dealing with high-frequency features. In addition, we
propose a scaled random initialization method for the first layer's weights in
FMMNNs, which significantly speeds up training and enhances overall
performance. Extensive numerical experiments support our theoretical insights,
showing that FMMNNs consistently outperform traditional approaches in accuracy
and efficiency across various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SGD and ADAM struggle with adaptability and efficiency in high-dimensional, non-convex settings.

Method: AYLA applies a power-law transformation to the loss function and uses a dynamic learning rate for better optimization.

Result: AYLA outperforms SGD and ADAM in synthetic tasks, curve-fitting, and real-world tasks like MNIST and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: AYLA enhances optimization by reshaping the loss landscape, offering a model-agnostic improvement for deep learning.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants, such as ADAM, are
foundational to deep learning optimization, adjusting model parameters through
fixed or adaptive learning rates based on loss function gradients. However,
these methods often struggle to balance adaptability and efficiency in
high-dimensional, non-convex settings. This paper introduces AYLA, a novel
optimization framework that enhances training dynamics via loss function
transformation. AYLA applies a tunable power-law transformation to the loss,
preserving critical points while scaling loss values to amplify gradient
sensitivity and accelerate convergence. Additionally, we propose an effective
learning rate that dynamically adapts to the transformed loss, further
improving optimization efficiency. Empirical evaluations on minimizing a
synthetic non-convex polynomial, solving a non-convex curve-fitting task, and
performing digit classification (MNIST) and image recognition (CIFAR-100)
demonstrate that AYLA consistently outperforms SGD and ADAM in both convergence
speed and training stability. By reshaping the loss landscape, AYLA provides a
model-agnostic enhancement to existing optimization methods, offering a
promising advancement in deep neural network training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network-based SDE models lack interpretability and struggle with generalization beyond training domains.

Method: FEX combines symbolic learning for deterministic SDE components with generative modeling for stochastic parts.

Result: FEX generalizes better and provides more accurate long-term predictions than neural networks, with interpretable symbolic expressions.

Conclusion: FEX enhances SDE modeling by offering interpretability, accuracy, and scientific insights, enabling new discoveries.

Abstract: Modeling stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is crucial for
understanding complex dynamical systems in various scientific fields. Recent
methods often employ neural network-based models, which typically represent
SDEs through a combination of deterministic and stochastic terms. However,
these models usually lack interpretability and have difficulty generalizing
beyond their training domain. This paper introduces the Finite Expression
Method (FEX), a symbolic learning approach designed to derive interpretable
mathematical representations of the deterministic component of SDEs. For the
stochastic component, we integrate FEX with advanced generative modeling
techniques to provide a comprehensive representation of SDEs. The numerical
experiments on linear, nonlinear, and multidimensional SDEs demonstrate that
FEX generalizes well beyond the training domain and delivers more accurate
long-term predictions compared to neural network-based methods. The symbolic
expressions identified by FEX not only improve prediction accuracy but also
offer valuable scientific insights into the underlying dynamics of the systems,

TL;DR: Proposes a frequency domain representation and 1D CNN for compound fault diagnosis in train transmission systems, achieving high accuracy on single and compound faults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven models are limited to single faults and separate components, performing poorly in real-world scenarios with interacting components.

Method: Uses frequency domain representation and a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) on the PHM Beijing 2024 dataset with multiple sensor channels and faults.

Result: Achieved 97.67% accuracy on single faults and 93.93% on compound faults.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of existing models, improving fault diagnosis for interacting components.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis prevents train disruptions by ensuring the stability and
reliability of their transmission systems. Data-driven fault diagnosis models
have several advantages over traditional methods in terms of dealing with
non-linearity, adaptability, scalability, and automation. However, existing
data-driven models are trained on separate transmission components and only
consider single faults due to the limitations of existing datasets. These
models will perform worse in scenarios where components operate with each other
at the same time, affecting each component's vibration signals. To address some
of these challenges, we propose a frequency domain representation and a
1-dimensional convolutional neural network for compound fault diagnosis and
applied it on the PHM Beijing 2024 dataset, which includes 21 sensor channels,
17 single faults, and 42 compound faults from 4 interacting components, that
is, motor, gearbox, left axle box, and right axle box. Our proposed model
achieved 97.67% and 93.93% accuracies on the test set with 17 single faults and
on the test set with 42 compound faults, respectively.

### [382] [Learning from Stochastic Teacher Representations Using Student-Guided Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14307)
*Muhammad Haseeb Aslam, Clara Martinez, Marco Pedersoli, Alessandro Koerich, Ali Etemad, Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Self-Distillation (SSD), a method to improve model performance by generating diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout and filtering them with student-guided knowledge distillation, avoiding the need for multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ensemble learning or weight averaging require training multiple models, which is impractical for resource-constrained applications. SSD aims to leverage stochasticity in a single model to achieve similar benefits without the overhead.

Method: SSD trains one model and generates diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. It filters and weights these representations using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD) to focus on task-relevant knowledge.

Result: SSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on affective computing, wearable/biosignal, and image classification datasets without increasing model size or computational complexity.

Conclusion: SSD provides a practical and efficient alternative to ensemble methods, improving performance while minimizing resource usage.

Abstract: Advances in self-distillation have shown that when knowledge is distilled
from a teacher to a student using the same deep learning (DL) architecture, the
student performance can surpass the teacher particularly when the network is
overparameterized and the teacher is trained with early stopping.
Alternatively, ensemble learning also improves performance, although training,
storing, and deploying multiple models becomes impractical as the number of
models grows. Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight
averaging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does
not fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling
diversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable
devices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple
diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However,
generating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations
that are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel
stochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for
filtering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant
representations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD). The
student representation at each distillation step is used as authority to guide
the distillation process. Experimental results on real-world affective
computing, wearable/biosignal datasets from the UCR Archive, the HAR dataset,
and image classification datasets show that the proposed SSD method can

### [383] [A General Framework for Property-Driven Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00466)
*Thomas Flinkow, Marco Casadio, Colin Kessler, Rosemary Monahan, Ekaterina Komendantskaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework combining adversarial training and differentiable logics to integrate logical specifications into neural network training, enhancing safety and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often fail to learn critical safety properties from data alone, necessitating methods that incorporate logical constraints directly into training.

Method: The approach unifies adversarial training (for robustness) and differentiable logics (for encoding logical constraints) into a single framework.

Result: The framework generalizes known properties and is validated on a drone control system case study.

Conclusion: The unified framework advances property-driven machine learning, supporting formal verification of neural networks.

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to learn critical safety
and correctness properties purely from data, highlighting the need for training
methods that directly integrate logical specifications. While adversarial
training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within
$\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems
and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region
specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Differentiable logics offer a
way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss terms that guide
the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In this paper, we
investigate how these two complementary approaches can be unified within a
single framework for property-driven machine learning, as a step toward
effective formal verification of neural networks. We show that well-known
properties from the literature are subcases of this general approach, and we
demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study involving a neural
network controller for a drone system. Our framework is made publicly available
at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

*Vincenzo De Paola, Riccardo Zamboni, Mirco Mutti, Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL framework maximizes data entropy in parallel settings by balancing individual agent entropy and inter-agent diversity, outperforming identical-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass the N-factor acceleration in parallel RL by specializing agent policies and minimizing data redundancy.

Method: Introduces a centralized policy gradient method to balance entropy and diversity, synergizing with batch RL techniques.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows promise against identical-agent systems, with faster rates for specialized parallel sampling.

Conclusion: The framework effectively maximizes data entropy and diversity, supported by theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Parallel data collection has redefined Reinforcement Learning (RL), unlocking
unprecedented efficiency and powering breakthroughs in large-scale real-world
applications. In this paradigm, $N$ identical agents operate in $N$ replicas of
an environment simulator, accelerating data collection by a factor of $N$. A
critical question arises: \textit{Does specializing the policies of the
parallel agents hold the key to surpass the $N$ factor acceleration?} In this
paper, we introduce a novel learning framework that maximizes the entropy of
collected data in a parallel setting. Our approach carefully balances the
entropy of individual agents with inter-agent diversity, effectively minimizing
redundancies. The latter idea is implemented with a centralized policy gradient
method, which shows promise when evaluated empirically against systems of
identical agents, as well as synergy with batch RL techniques that can exploit
data diversity. Finally, we provide an original concentration analysis that
shows faster rates for specialized parallel sampling distributions, which
supports our methodology and may be of independent interest.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FDA-Opt is a new algorithm combining FedOpt and FDA, outperforming FedOpt in fine-tuning LMs for FL without extra configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rigid communication and calibration challenges in FL for fine-tuning large LMs.

Method: Proposes FDA-Opt, a unified generalization of FDA and FedOpt, dynamically adjusting model exchanges.

Result: FDA-Opt outperforms FedOpt in fine-tuning LMs on NLP tasks, even with optimized FedOpt hyper-parameters.

Conclusion: FDA-Opt is a practical, superior drop-in replacement for FedOpt in FL systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the utilization of vast, previously
inaccessible data sources. At the same time, pre-trained Language Models (LMs)
have taken the world by storm and for good reason. They exhibit remarkable
emergent abilities and are readily adapted to downstream tasks. This opens one
of the most exciting frontiers in FL: fine-tuning LMs. Yet, a persistent
challenge in FL is the frequent, rigid communication of parameters -- a problem
magnified by the sheer size of these contemporary models. The FedOpt family of
algorithms has become the go-to approach for FL, relying on fixed but arbitrary
intervals for model exchanges. Recently, the FDA algorithm prescribed a dynamic
approach by monitoring the training progress. However, it introduced a
hard-to-calibrate parameter and imposed a rigid synchronization scheme. In this
work, we address these limitations by proposing the FDA-Opt family of
algorithms -- a unified generalization of both FDA and FedOpt. Our experimental
evaluation focuses on fine-tuning LMs on downstream NLP tasks and demonstrates
that FDA-Opt outperforms FedOpt even when it is configured with
hyper-parameters specifically optimized for the latter. In other words, we show
that FDA-Opt is a practical, drop-in replacement for FedOpt in modern FL
libraries and systems: it requires no additional configuration and delivers
superior performance out of the box.

### [386] [Critical Batch Size Revisited: A Simple Empirical Approach to Large-Batch Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23971)
*William Merrill, Shane Arora, Dirk Groeneveld, Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an empirical method to measure the critical batch size (CBS) in language model training, showing its evolution and proposing batch size warmup for efficient large-scale training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating CBS rely on strong assumptions, limiting trust and applicability. The paper aims to provide a direct, empirical approach to measure CBS and understand its dynamics.

Method: The authors introduce a simple empirical approach to directly measure CBS and observe its evolution during training, using OLMo models of varying sizes (1B and 7B).

Result: CBS starts near zero at initialization, increases rapidly, and plateaus. This trend holds across model sizes, enabling small-scale runs to inform larger ones. Batch size warmup improves training efficiency (43% fewer steps for OLMo 1B).

Conclusion: The empirical measurement of CBS and batch size warmup offer a reliable way to train language models at larger batch sizes without performance loss, enhancing data parallelism.

Abstract: The right batch size is important when training language models at scale: a
large batch size is necessary for fast training, but a batch size that is too
large will harm token efficiency. To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.
(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not
substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale
during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when
training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a
proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be
trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a
simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS
evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that
CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus
as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across
different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can
inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over
training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language
models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the
CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to
slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient
steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language
models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising
performance.

### [387] [Rethinking Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problems with Different Constraint Tightness Degrees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24627)
*Fu Luo, Yaoxin Wu, Zhi Zheng, Zhenkun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods, revealing overfitting to fixed constraint values. It proposes a training scheme and multi-expert module to improve adaptability, showing superior performance on CVRP and CVRPTW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCO methods lack research on constraint tightness effects, leading to overfitting and poor performance on varying constraints.

Method: Proposes a training scheme considering varying constraint tightness and a multi-expert module for adaptable solving strategies.

Result: The method effectively overcomes overfitting, performing well on CVRP and CVRPTW with diverse constraint tightness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances NCO adaptability, addressing limitations of existing methods for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising
problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most
existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint
value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the
performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle
routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance
under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis
reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can
only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but
poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we
develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees
of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally
adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method
can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior
performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various
constraint tightness degrees.

### [388] [Learning Treatment Representations for Downstream Instrumental Variable Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02200)
*Shiangyi Lin, Hui Lan, Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in IV estimators for high-dimensional treatments by proposing a method that incorporates instruments during representation learning, improving accuracy over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IV estimators struggle with high-dimensional treatments, often leading to omitted variable bias when unsupervised dimension reduction is used.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach where instrumental variables are explicitly integrated into the treatment representation learning process.

Result: The method theoretically and empirically ensures identification of outcome-optimizing directions, outperforming conventional two-stage approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating instruments during representation learning mitigates bias and enhances the performance of IV models for high-dimensional treatments.

Abstract: Traditional instrumental variable (IV) estimators face a fundamental
constraint: they can only accommodate as many endogenous treatment variables as
available instruments. This limitation becomes particularly challenging in
settings where the treatment is presented in a high-dimensional and
unstructured manner (e.g. descriptions of patient treatment pathways in a
hospital). In such settings, researchers typically resort to applying
unsupervised dimension reduction techniques to learn a low-dimensional
treatment representation prior to implementing IV regression analysis. We show
that such methods can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias due to
implicit regularization in the representation learning step. We propose a novel
approach to construct treatment representations by explicitly incorporating
instrumental variables during the representation learning process. Our approach
provides a framework for handling high-dimensional endogenous variables with
limited instruments. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
fitting IV models on these instrument-informed representations ensures
identification of directions that optimize outcome prediction. Our experiments
show that our proposed methodology improves upon the conventional two-stage
approaches that perform dimension reduction without incorporating instrument
information.

*Constantin Venhoff, Iván Arcuschin, Philip Torr, Arthur Conmy, Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A steering method for controlling reasoning behaviors in thinking LLMs is introduced, validated on DeepSeek-R1-Distill models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of controlling reasoning processes in thinking LLMs despite their improved performance.

Method: Analyze and manipulate reasoning behaviors via steering vectors in the model's activation space, tested on 500 tasks across 10 categories.

Result: Identified and controlled behaviors like uncertainty expression and backtracking, validated across different model architectures.

Conclusion: The approach provides interpretable and practical tools for steering reasoning in thinking LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

*Aleksandr Algazinov, Matt Laing, Paul Laban*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MATE is a multimodal accessibility multi-agent system (MAS) designed to assist users with disabilities by converting data into understandable formats, ensuring privacy and adaptability across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS lack customization for accessibility, creating barriers for users with disabilities. MATE addresses this by providing flexible, privacy-focused solutions.

Method: MATE uses modality conversions (e.g., image to audio) and supports multiple models (LLM APIs, custom ML classifiers). It includes ModCon-Task-Identifier for task extraction.

Result: MATE outperforms other models in modality conversion tasks and is adaptable to diverse needs and hardware.

Conclusion: MATE is a versatile, privacy-preserving MAS that enhances accessibility for users with disabilities across multiple domains.

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at

*Xiaoting Yang, Wei Lv, Ting Yang, Bart Baesens*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage, multi-scenario governance mechanism for cyber violence, combining evolutionary game theory and communication dynamics to analyze and mitigate its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber violence disrupts public order, but existing studies lack micro-level analysis. This study aims to bridge the gap by integrating micro- and macro-level perspectives.

Method: A two-phase approach: (1) evolutionary game model with four parties and Matlab simulations, (2) SBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination with Netlogo simulations, incorporating emotional factors and bystander roles.

Result: Strong government regulation with moderate punishment is most effective. Collaborative intervention between media and government works best, while media-only strategies are weakest.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism, validated by simulations and a case study, offers practical solutions for cyber violence governance, emphasizing collaboration and multi-stage analysis.

Abstract: Cyber violence severely disrupts public order in both cyberspace and the real
world. Existing studies have gradually advocated collaborative governance but
rely on macro-level theoretical analyses. This study integrates micro- and
macro-level perspectives to propose a two-stage, multi-scenario governance
mechanism for cyber violence. In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary
game model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on
evolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government
regulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against
the online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most
desirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was
introduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors
were considered alongside game strategies. This led to the development of a new
SBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination in cyber violence. Netlogo
simulations found that increasing the "correct guidance" strategy by the online
media reduces the influence of cyber violence supporters and the time it takes
for their nodes to drop to zero, but does not significantly shorten the time
for the peak to occur. Comparatively, collaborative intervention between the
online media and the government was most effective in curbing public opinion,
followed by the government's independent "strong regulation." Relying solely on
the online media's "correct guidance" produced the weakest effect. Finally,
this mechanism was applied to a case study, and a multi-stage, multi-scenario
analysis based on life cycle theory enhanced its practical applicability.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper surveys multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) from a task-agnostic perspective, addressing limitations in existing surveys by covering diverse methods like multi-modal, multi-agent, time-series, and multimodal LLM fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSFP surveys are limited to single tasks or perspectives, hindering broader applicability. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive, task-agnostic review.

Method: The paper organizes MSFP research by introducing background, reviewing multi-modal and multi-agent fusion, analyzing time-series fusion, and investigating multimodal LLM fusion.

Result: A detailed survey of MSFP methods is presented, highlighting diverse technical approaches and their applications.

Conclusion: The paper identifies open challenges and future directions, aiming to aid researchers in understanding MSFP progress and inspire future work.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

*Ruixiang Zhao, Jian Jia, Yan Li, Xuehan Bai, Quan Chen, Han Li, Peng Jiang, Xirong Li*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: AMPere proposes a multimodal product representation method using LLM-summarized ASR text and visual data to improve cross-domain product retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce relies on multimedia, but visual-only representation is insufficient due to product variance and similarity. Noisy ASR text needs denoising for effective multimodal learning.

Method: AMPere uses an LLM-based ASR text summarizer to extract product-specific info, then combines it with visual data in a multi-branch network for embedding.

Result: Experiments on a tri-domain dataset show AMPere's effectiveness in unified multimodal representation and cross-domain retrieval.

Conclusion: AMPere enhances product representation by integrating denoised ASR text and visuals, improving retrieval performance.

Abstract: E-commerce is increasingly multimedia-enriched, with products exhibited in a
broad-domain manner as images, short videos, or live stream promotions. A
unified and vectorized cross-domain production representation is essential. Due
to large intra-product variance and high inter-product similarity in the
broad-domain scenario, a visual-only representation is inadequate. While
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text derived from the short or live-stream
videos is readily accessible, how to de-noise the excessively noisy text for
multimodal representation learning is mostly untouched. We propose ASR-enhanced
Multimodal Product Representation Learning (AMPere). In order to extract
product-specific information from the raw ASR text, AMPere uses an
easy-to-implement LLM-based ASR text summarizer. The LLM-summarized text,
together with visual data, is then fed into a multi-branch network to generate
compact multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on a large-scale
tri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unified
multimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain product
retrieval.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This review paper surveys recent loss functions for binaural reproduction, focusing on perceptual cues like localization and room response, and highlights future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional signal-related measures often fail to capture perceptual properties essential for spatial audio quality, prompting a need for perceptually grounded loss functions.

Method: The review analyzes loss functions for binaural signals derived from microphone recordings or Ambisonics, guided by the Spatial Audio Quality Inventory (SAQI), focusing on localization and room response cues.

Result: Literature shows a strong focus on localization cues (ITDs, ILDs), while room acoustic attributes like reverberation are less explored. Recent works suggest potential for integrating room characteristics into loss functions.

Conclusion: Future research should develop more perceptually grounded loss functions to better capture the listener's spatial experience, including room acoustic attributes.

Abstract: Binaural reproduction aims to deliver immersive spatial audio with high
perceptual realism over headphones. Loss functions play a central role in
optimizing and evaluating algorithms that generate binaural signals. However,
traditional signal-related difference measures often fail to capture the
perceptual properties that are essential to spatial audio quality. This review
paper surveys recent loss functions that incorporate spatial perception cues
relevant to binaural reproduction. It focuses on losses applied to binaural
signals, which are often derived from microphone recordings or Ambisonics
signals, while excluding those based on room impulse responses. Guided by the
Spatial Audio Quality Inventory (SAQI), the review emphasizes perceptual
dimensions related to source localization and room response, while excluding
general spectral-temporal attributes. The literature survey reveals a strong
focus on localization cues, such as interaural time and level differences
(ITDs, ILDs), while reverberation and other room acoustic attributes remain
less explored in loss function design. Recent works that estimate room acoustic
parameters and develop embeddings that capture room characteristics indicate
their potential for future integration into neural network training. The paper
concludes by highlighting future research directions toward more perceptually
grounded loss functions that better capture the listener's spatial experience.

TL;DR: Kling-Foley is a multimodal Video-to-Audio generation model using diffusion transformers, visual semantic representation, and audio-visual synchronization to produce high-quality, synchronized audio. It includes a universal latent audio codec and stereo rendering, achieving SOTA performance.

Motivation: To synthesize high-quality audio synchronized with video content by modeling interactions between video, audio, and text modalities.

Method: Uses multimodal diffusion transformers, visual semantic representation, and audio-visual synchronization modules. Introduces a universal latent audio codec and stereo rendering.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment, and audio quality.

Conclusion: Kling-Foley effectively generates video-matching sound effects with high alignment and quality, supported by a new benchmark.

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

*Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS) to improve Speaker Verification (SV) by addressing limitations of standard SSL frameworks, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SSL frameworks for SV rely on same-utterance positive sampling, which encodes channel information rather than speaker identity. This limits performance.

Method: Proposes SSPS, a technique to find positives of the same speaker but different recording conditions using clustering and a memory queue of embeddings.

Result: SSPS improves SV performance, achieving 2.57% and 2.53% EER for SimCLR and DINO, respectively, outperforming SOTA methods on VoxCeleb1-O.

Conclusion: SSPS effectively reduces intra-speaker variance, enhancing SV performance and matching DINO-SSPS results with SimCLR.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has led to considerable progress in Speaker
Verification (SV). The standard framework uses same-utterance positive sampling
and data-augmentation to generate anchor-positive pairs of the same speaker.
This is a major limitation, as this strategy primarily encodes channel
information from the recording condition, shared by the anchor and positive. We
propose a new positive sampling technique to address this bottleneck:
Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS). For a given anchor, SSPS aims to find
an appropriate positive, i.e., of the same speaker identity but a different
recording condition, in the latent space using clustering assignments and a
memory queue of positive embeddings. SSPS improves SV performance for both
SimCLR and DINO, reaching 2.57% and 2.53% EER, outperforming SOTA SSL methods
on VoxCeleb1-O. In particular, SimCLR-SSPS achieves a 58% EER reduction by
lowering intra-speaker variance, providing comparable performance to DINO-SSPS.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: NIC-RobustBench is an open-source framework for evaluating neural image compression (NIC) robustness and adversarial defenses, offering scalability and comprehensive codec support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of JPEG AI and limited prior research on NIC robustness evaluation necessitated a broader, scalable solution.

Method: Developed NIC-RobustBench, an open-source framework with extensive codec support and scalability for evaluating NIC robustness and defenses.

Result: The framework provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing NIC robustness and comparing Rate-Distortion performance.

Conclusion: NIC-RobustBench addresses gaps in NIC robustness evaluation and is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area
of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models
(LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for
end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating
NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research
has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we
present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate
NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing
Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of
codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper

*Zefan Yang, Xinrui Song, Xuanang Xu, Yongyi Shi, Ge Wang, Mannudeep K. Kalra, Pingkun Yan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Xray2Xray, a novel World Model, learns 3D structural information from 2D chest X-rays to improve disease diagnosis and risk prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D chest X-rays have limitations due to structural superposition, hindering precise diagnosis. This study aims to overcome these limitations by capturing 3D structural information.

Method: Xray2Xray uses a vision model and transition model to learn latent representations of chest volume from X-ray projections across angular positions. These representations are applied to risk prediction and disease diagnosis.

Result: Xray2Xray outperformed supervised and self-supervised methods in cardiovascular risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in pathology classification. Latent representations also enabled volumetric reconstruction.

Conclusion: Xray2Xray effectively bridges the gap between 2D and 3D imaging, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and risk prediction in chest X-rays.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and
play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images,
CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their
effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the
limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model
that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from
chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume
by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different
angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the
latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease
diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both
supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular
disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying
five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent
representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent
representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

*Umair Khan, Jouni Härkönen, Marjukka Friman, Leena Latonen, Teijo Kuopio, Pekka Ruusuvuori*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses computational stain normalization methods to reduce variability in H&E-stained tissue images across labs, comparing eight methods using a unique multi-center dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variation in H&E-stained tissue images across labs challenges pathologists and AI analysis, necessitating computational solutions.

Method: Collected a multi-center dataset with controlled variables, compared eight stain normalization methods (four traditional, two deep learning-based) using quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Result: The dataset highlights inter-lab staining variation, aiding in assessing normalization methods and improving AI model generalizability.

Conclusion: Stain normalization methods can mitigate variability, and diverse training data from multi-center datasets enhances model robustness.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for
decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary,
often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both
pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation
computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this
problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein
tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to
66 different labs for routine H&E staining. To isolate staining variation,
other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we
used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different
stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely,
histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep
learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants
each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the
performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation
could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied
training data

### [400] [A Deep Learning Based Method for Fast Registration of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19167)
*Benjamin Graham*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fast, volumetric deep learning model (FLIR) is proposed for cardiac image registration, achieving high accuracy and speed for quantifying cardiac strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration in medical applications, like cardiac imaging, is challenging due to lack of ground truth and computational inefficiency of existing methods.

Method: The FLIR model uses an efficient convolutional architecture for fast and accurate volumetric registration of cardiac images.

Result: FLIR achieves similar registration fidelity to state-of-the-art models but is significantly faster, with consistent strain measurements.

Conclusion: FLIR is a practical solution for cardiac strain quantification, balancing speed and accuracy for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

### [401] [VHU-Net: Variational Hadamard U-Net for Body MRI Bias Field Correction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19181)
*Xin Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes VHU-Net, a variational Hadamard U-Net, for MRI bias field correction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in uniformity, fidelity, and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias field artifacts in MRI degrade image quality and hinder analysis, necessitating an effective correction method.

Method: Uses a variational Hadamard U-Net with ConvHTBlocks for frequency decomposition and noise suppression, and an inverse HT-reconstructed transformer for global attention.

Result: Superior performance in uniformity, fidelity, and segmentation on abdominal and prostate MRI datasets.

Conclusion: VHU-Net is efficient, interpretable, and robust, suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Bias field artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans introduce
spatially smooth intensity inhomogeneities that degrade image quality and
hinder downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
variational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) for effective body MRI bias field
correction. The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform
blocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard
transform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise
frequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent
scaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant
high-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model
inter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse
HT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention
for the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder
ConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying
ground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference,
we formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective,
promoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field
estimation. Comprehensive experiments on abdominal and prostate MRI datasets
demonstrate the superiority of VHU-Net over existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of intensity uniformity, signal fidelity, and tissue contrast.
Moreover, the corrected images yield substantial downstream improvements in
segmentation accuracy. Our framework offers computational efficiency,
interpretability, and robust performance across multi-center datasets, making
it suitable for clinical deployment.

*Xinke Ma, Yongsheng Pan, Qingjie Zeng, Mengkang Lu, Bolysbek Murat Yerzhanuly, Bazargul Matkerim, Yong Xia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EASR-DCN improves deformable medical image registration by representing images with effective ROIs and aligning them independently without labels, outperforming VoxelMorph in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based DMIR methods lack effective ROI representation and rely on labels or unsupervised alignment, limiting performance.

Method: Uses Gaussian mixture model for ROI representation and a Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) for independent ROI alignment, integrating results into a displacement field.

Result: Achieved 10.31%, 13.01%, and 5.75% Dice score improvements over VoxelMorph for brain, cardiac, and hippocampus MRI datasets.

Conclusion: EASR-DCN offers superior accuracy and deformation reduction, showing promise for clinical applications.

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent
alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable
medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods
have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and
proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods
heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named
EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and
achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels.
Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to
represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process
these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI.
The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a
comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed
on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and
deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our
EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI,
13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its
promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Motivation: Anomaly detection in digital pathology is promising but faces unique challenges not addressed by current methods.

Method: Evaluated classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods on five curated datasets, analyzing image scale, anomaly types, and training strategies.

Result: Detailed comparison of method strengths and limitations, providing a benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: Establishes a comprehensive benchmark to guide anomaly detection advancements in digital pathology.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect
inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In
digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for
applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and
biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images,
such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and
repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection
algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over
20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive
experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and
synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments
investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training
epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a
detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a
comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for
digital pathology images.

### [404] [Explicit Residual-Based Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19297)
*Yui Tatsumi, Ziyue Zeng, Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two scalable image compression methods (FR-ICMH and PR-ICMH) for both machine and human vision, improving efficiency and interpretability by integrating residual compression. PR-ICMH achieves 29.57% BD-rate savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of images by both humans and machine vision models necessitates scalable compression methods that cater to both, addressing limitations in existing neural network-based approaches.

Method: The authors integrate an explicit residual compression mechanism into the ICMH framework, proposing FR-ICMH and PR-ICMH for flexible and efficient compression.

Result: PR-ICMH achieves up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over prior work, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance coding efficiency and adaptability for diverse applications, bridging gaps in scalable image compression for machine and human vision.

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs
multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years,
images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image
recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image
compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many
existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image
compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully
designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant
on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently
considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and
interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual
compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding
methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:
Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based
Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various
machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between
encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse
application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over
the previous work.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores optimal strategies for explicit alignment in mammography, comparing input vs. representation space alignment and joint optimization with risk prediction. It finds image-level alignment superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve breast cancer risk prediction by leveraging temporal mammogram data and optimizing alignment methods.

Method: Compares explicit alignment strategies (input vs. representation space) and joint optimization with risk prediction. Uses deformable registration for alignment.

Result: Image-level alignment outperforms representation-level, improving deformation field quality and risk prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Joint learning in representation space trades alignment quality for predictive performance; image-level alignment is recommended.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection.
Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust
screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on
current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of
screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial
alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have
emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and
implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former
providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in
mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into
where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space)
and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We
demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space
while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current
state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and
predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to
representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and
enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at

*Khuram Naveed, Bruna Neves de Freitas, Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a noise-aware self-attention method (NAADA) to improve fine detail recovery in dental radiographs, outperforming heavier models like Uformer and MResDNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional DAEs struggle with high-frequency details in images, especially in dental radiographs where fine anatomical structures are critical. Existing attention methods often ignore noisy regions.

Method: Introduces a noise-aware self-attention mechanism to focus on and recover key features in noisy regions, leading to the NAADA network.

Result: NAADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Uformer, MResDNN) in reconstructing fine details, enhancing image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: The noise-aware attention approach effectively addresses the limitations of conventional DAEs, improving detail preservation in dental radiographs.

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

*Zhifeng Wang, Renjiao Yi, Xin Wen, Chenyang Zhu, Kai Xu, Kunlun He*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A self-supervised diffusion model (Angio-Diff) is proposed to transform non-angiographic X-rays into angiographic X-rays, addressing data shortages and improving geometric accuracy in vessel synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vascular diseases require angiographic X-rays for diagnosis, but high radiation exposure is a concern. Current methods struggle with geometric accuracy in vessel synthesis due to lack of paired datasets.

Method: The method uses a diffusion model to learn vascular data distribution, a generator for synthesis, and a mask-based adversarial module. A parametric vascular model enhances geometric accuracy.

Result: Angio-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and accurately synthesizes vessel geometry.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a viable solution for high-quality angiography synthesis, mitigating data shortages and improving geometric fidelity.

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray
angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for
detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose
personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,
which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to
angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by
the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making
high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We
find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and
struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as
disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a
self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic
X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven
approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution
of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a
mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a
parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels.
The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray
angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to
evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more
accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels. The code is

*Joris Wuts, Jakub Ceranka, Nicolas Michoux, Frédéric Lecouvet, Jef Vandemeulebroucke*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for segmenting metastatic bone disease in WB-MRI, outperforming baseline and SSL methods with improved accuracy and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting metastatic bone disease in WB-MRI is challenging due to lesion variability, ambiguous boundaries, and class imbalance. Existing methods like SSL fail to capture nuanced features for accurate detection.

Method: SAP learns from limited anatomical labels, first training a skeletal segmentation model on healthy WB-MRI scans, then applying it to segment MBD in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

Result: SAP achieves a normalized surface Dice of 0.76, Dice coefficient of 0.64, and lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, with 100% sensitivity for lesions >1ml in 28/32 patients.

Conclusion: Learning bone morphology from anatomy provides an effective inductive bias for segmenting bone lesions, with SAP outperforming baseline and SSL methods. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)
is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations
of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining
reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion
variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,
and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large
unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the
nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method
that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based
skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from
healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its
downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a
state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,
achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The
method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24
(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions
larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32
patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant
inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of
bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

*Klara Leffler, Luigi Tommaso Luppino, Samuel Kuttner, Karin Söderkvist, Jan Axelsson*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep sinogram restoration network is proposed to compensate for missing data in sparse PET scanner configurations, reducing costs while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs of densely packed photodetectors in long axial field-of-view PET scanners limit clinical use. Sparse configurations reduce costs but degrade image quality.

Method: A modified Residual U-Net is trained on clinical PET scans, simulating 50% detector removal in a chessboard pattern to restore missing sinogram data.

Result: The model recovers missing counts with low error, outperforming 2D interpolation, though reconstructed images lose some sharpness.

Conclusion: Sparse detector configurations with deep learning offer a cost-effective alternative for total body PET scanners, advancing medical imaging.

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and
sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost
is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the
extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost
limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,
allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a
standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we
propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram
data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET
scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in
a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model
successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two
events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and
reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a
smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer
details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial
capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector
configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector
configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable
alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the
development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant
step forward in medical imaging technology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture combining DeepLabV3 and ConvLSTM is proposed for prostate gland segmentation in MRI, improving accuracy and robustness in data-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D CNNs lack inter-slice continuity, while 3D models require extensive annotated data, limiting clinical practicality.

Method: Uses a pretrained DeepLabV3 backbone for slice-wise feature extraction and ConvLSTM layers to integrate spatial-temporal information across slices.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art 2D and 3D models on the PROMISE12 benchmark in precision, recall, IoU, and DSC, especially in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers robust, context-aware segmentation suitable for clinical deployment with limited data.

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet
challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep
learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most
conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks
(CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their
accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but
require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical
settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that
models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained
DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice
and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate
information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination
enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in
data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the
PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings.
Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection
over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its
potential for robust clinical deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the local-global training mismatch in NeRF-based CBCT reconstruction by introducing a Normalized Hash Encoder and Mapping Consistency Initialization, improving stability, convergence, and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT reconstruction suffers from artifacts due to limited X-ray projections. NeRF-based methods face a local-global training mismatch, causing unstable training and degraded results.

Method: Proposes a Normalized Hash Encoder for feature consistency and a Mapping Consistency Initialization strategy to stabilize early training.

Result: The method improves training efficiency, stability, and reconstruction quality across 128 CT cases from 4 datasets.

Conclusion: The introduced techniques effectively mitigate the local-global mismatch, enhancing NeRF-based CBCT reconstruction with minimal code changes.

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,

### [412] [Systematic Review of Pituitary Gland and Pituitary Adenoma Automatic Segmentation Techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19797)
*Mubaraq Yakubu, Navodini Wijethilake, Jonathan Shapey, Andrew King, Alexander Hammers*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A systematic review of MRI-based automatic segmentation methods for pituitary gland and adenomas, highlighting the prevalence of U-Net models and performance variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation is crucial for diagnosing and treating pituitary adenomas, but current methods lack consistency and reporting of key metrics.

Method: Reviewed 34 studies on automatic and semi-automatic segmentation, analyzing techniques and performance metrics like Dice scores.

Result: Deep learning, especially U-Net, dominated; performance varied widely (Dice scores: 0.19--96.41%). Semi-automatic methods were more consistent.

Conclusion: U-Net models show promise, but improvements are needed for small structures. Larger datasets and better reporting are essential for clinical use.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of
pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation
methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of
pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that
employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and
synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as
Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep
learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent.
Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and
4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported
80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation.
Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field
strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as
U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but
further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in
small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and
larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical
applicability.

### [413] [Diff-Def: Diffusion-Generated Deformation Fields for Conditional Atlases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16776)
*Sophie Starck, Vasiliki Sideri-Lampretsa, Bernhard Kainz, Martin J. Menten, Tamara T. Mueller, Daniel Rueckert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields for creating conditional atlases, ensuring structural integrity and avoiding hallucinations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of registration-based and GAN methods in handling large anatomical variations and training instabilities for conditional atlas generation.

Method: Uses latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, transforming a general population atlas into a sub-population-specific one, with regularization via a neighbourhood of images.

Result: Generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The method enhances interpretability and anatomical accuracy, validated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Anatomical atlases are widely used for population studies and analysis.
Conditional atlases target a specific sub-population defined via certain
conditions, such as demographics or pathologies, and allow for the
investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences like morphological changes
associated with ageing or disease. Existing approaches use either
registration-based methods that are often unable to handle large anatomical
variations or generative adversarial models, which are challenging to train
since they can suffer from training instabilities. Instead of generating
atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to
generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into
one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural
integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise
during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and
regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to
several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from
the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth
transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines.
We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations,
including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity,
and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the
generated atlases.

### [414] [IgCONDA-PET: Weakly-Supervised PET Anomaly Detection using Implicitly-Guided Attention-Conditional Counterfactual Diffusion Modeling -- a Multi-Center, Multi-Cancer, and Multi-Tracer Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00239)
*Shadab Ahamed, Arman Rahmim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: IgCONDA-PET is a weakly-supervised method for detecting anomalies in PET images using implicit diffusion guidance and counterfactual generation, reducing reliance on pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the need for costly and time-consuming pixel-level annotations in PET lesion detection and segmentation, addressing limitations of GAN-based methods.

Method: Uses implicit diffusion guidance and attention modules for training on healthy vs. unhealthy labels, generating synthetic healthy images for anomaly detection.

Result: Validated on 2652 multi-cancer, multi-tracer PET scans, outperforming other weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods and traditional thresholding.

Conclusion: IgCONDA-PET effectively detects anomalies with reduced annotation dependency, highlighting the role of attention modules for small lesion detection.

Abstract: Minimizing the need for pixel-level annotated data to train PET lesion
detection and segmentation networks is highly desired and can be
transformative, given time and cost constraints associated with expert
annotations. Current unsupervised or weakly-supervised anomaly detection
methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained
only on healthy data. While these approaches reduce annotation dependency,
GAN-based methods are notably more challenging to train than non-GAN
alternatives (such as autoencoders) due to issues such as the simultaneous
optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, and training
instability. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised
$\textbf{I}$mplicitly-$\textbf{g}$uided $\textbf{CO}$u$\textbf{N}$terfactual
diffusion model for $\textbf{D}$etecting $\textbf{A}$nomalies in $\textbf{PET}$
images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans
from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases
(multi-cancer, multi-tracer) containing both local and public datasets
(spanning multiple centers). The training is conditioned on image class labels
(healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion
guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates
"unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy
version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies
through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared
against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised
methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUV$_\text{max}$ thresholding.
We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our
network for the detection of small anomalies. The code is publicly available
at: https://github.com/ahxmeds/IgCONDA-PET.git.

### [415] [Improved and Explainable Cervical Cancer Classification using Ensemble Pooling of Block Fused Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01600)
*Saurabh Saini, Kapil Ahuja, Akshat S. Chauhan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed new models for cervical cancer detection outperform previous methods by leveraging detailed and abstract features from ResNets, achieving high accuracy and introducing a novel explainability method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer detection models had limited success, and detailed features from earlier convolution blocks were underutilized.

Method: Used ResNets (50, 101, 152) with novel feature selection (Global Max/Average Pooling) and introduced Cascaded Block Fused variants. Combined and normalized features for improved models, using linear SVM for classification.

Result: Achieved 97.92% and 92.97% accuracy on IARC and AnnoCerv datasets, surpassing standard ResNets by 7.03% and 5.00%, respectively. Outperformed competitive approaches by 13.20%.

Conclusion: The proposed models significantly improve cervical cancer detection accuracy and include a novel explainability method (SHAP+LIME) for precise cancerous region identification.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women and causes high
death rates. Earlier models for detecting cervical cancer had limited success.
In this work, we propose new models that substantially outperform previous
models.
  Previous studies show that pretrained ResNets extract features from cervical
cancer images well. Hence, our first model involves working with three ResNets
(50, 101, 152). All the existing works use only the last convolution block of
their respective ResNet, which captures abstract features (e.g., shapes,
objects). However, we believe that detailed features (e.g., color, edges,
texture), coming from earlier convolution blocks, are equally important for
cancer (specifically cervical cancer) classification. Since now the number of
features become large, we use a novel feature selection technique of Global Max
Pooling for detailed features and Global Average Pooling for abstract features.
Hence, our second model consists of the resulting Cascaded Block Fused variants
of the three ResNets. To improve the performance further, we combine and
normalize the features of the three standard ResNets as well as our proposed
three Cascaded Block Fused ResNets. This type of combination is also new in
cancer classification domain (also in cervical cancer), and results in our
third and fourth models, respectively. We use a linear SVM for classification.
  We exhaustively perform experiments on two public datasets, IARC and
AnnoCerv, achieving an average performance of 97.92% and 92.97% surpassing
standard ResNets performance of 90.89% and 87.97%, respectively. We outperform
the competitive approach available on IARC dataset with an average gain of
13.20%, while no prior competitive work available on AnnoCerv. Additionally, we
introduce a novel SHAP+LIME explainability method, accurately identifying the
cancerous region in 97% of cases.

### [416] [MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via continual learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10394)
*Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOST, a method to optimize MR reconstruction for multiple downstream tasks using continual learning, outperforming other approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MR reconstruction methods neglect downstream task performance, causing degradation when tasks are cascaded.

Method: MOST extends optimization to multi-task scenarios using replay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to prevent forgetting.

Result: MOST outperformed non-finetuned, naively finetuned, and conventional continual learning methods.

Conclusion: A single MR reconstruction network can be effectively optimized for multiple tasks using MOST, improving downstream performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have
focused on generating high-quality images but often overlook the impact on
downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.
Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network
has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation
and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream
task-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single
downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi-task scenarios is not
straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially
introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR
reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by
deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from
replay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic
forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a
reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with
na\"ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. The source
code is available at: https://github.com/SNU-LIST/MOST.

### [417] [VesselSAM: Leveraging SAM for Aortic Vessel Segmentation with AtrousLoRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18185)
*Adnan Iltaf, Rayan Merghani Ahmed, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VesselSAM, an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) with AtrousLoRA, improves aortic vessel segmentation by capturing multi-scale context and reducing computational overhead, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vessel segmentation is challenging due to small size, complex edges, and imaging noise, necessitating a specialized solution for clinical use.

Method: VesselSAM integrates AtrousLoRA (combining Atrous Attention and LoRA) to enhance SAM, preserving local details and global context while reducing trainable parameters.

Result: Achieves DSC scores of 93.50%, 93.25%, 93.02%, and 93.26% on AVT and TBAD datasets, outperforming existing models with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: VesselSAM offers high accuracy and efficiency, advancing AI-based aortic vessel segmentation for clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as
vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to
their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts
and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel
segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating
Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation
performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale
contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader
global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the
frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and
thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two
challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B
Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\%
across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers
high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for
enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code
and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.

### [418] [A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19447)
*Hengtong Shen, Haiyan Gu, Haitao Li, Yi Yang, Agen Qiu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PerA is a novel self-supervised method for Remote Sensing (RS) images, using perfectly aligned sample pairs and spatially disjoint masks to improve feature quality and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive Learning (CL) methods struggle with domain gaps in RS images, requiring adaptation. PerA addresses this by ensuring semantic alignment and reducing noise impact.

Method: PerA applies spatially disjoint masks to augmented images for feature extraction, ensuring teacher-student consistency and predicting learnable mask tokens.

Result: PerA shows higher memory efficiency, adaptability to uncurated RS data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods with limited model scale.

Conclusion: PerA effectively addresses domain gaps in RS images, offering a practical solution for remote sensing interpretation.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models
without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL)
methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise
interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have
achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require
specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a
novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS
features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically,
PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks
to augmented images rather than random cropping. Our framework provides
high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and
predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our
method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger
batches due to its sparse inputs. Additionally, the proposed method
demonstrates remarkable adaptability to uncurated RS data and reduce the impact
of the potential semantic inconsistency. We also collect an unlabeled
pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted
experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance
comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work will
contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The crossMoDA challenge series focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation for MRI, evolving over years to enhance clinical relevance. Findings show improved outlier reduction with expanded datasets, though cochlea segmentation performance declined in 2023 due to added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 MRI for cost-effective VS management, addressing domain shift challenges.

Method: Unsupervised cross-modality segmentation from ceT1 to T2 MRI, evolving from single-institutional data (2021) to multi-institutional and heterogeneous data (2023).

Result: Outliers decreased with dataset expansion, but cochlea Dice score declined in 2023 due to added tumour sub-annotations. The 2023 winning approach improved performance on earlier data.

Conclusion: Progress is needed for clinically acceptable VS segmentation. Future benchmarks may require more challenging cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

*Ankita Raj, Harsh Swaika, Deepankar Varma, Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores model stealing (MS) attacks on black-box medical imaging models, proposing a two-step method (QueryWise) to clone models using limited queries and public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary medical imaging models are vulnerable to MS attacks, but their susceptibility is understudied. This work addresses this gap under realistic constraints.

Method: Proposes QueryWise, a two-step MS approach using proxy datasets and limited queries to train a thief model without extra queries.

Result: Demonstrates successful MS attacks on Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification models using public datasets.

Conclusion: Medical imaging models are vulnerable to MS attacks; QueryWise enhances attack efficiency with limited queries.

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.
