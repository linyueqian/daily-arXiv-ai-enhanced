This strategic sparsification reduces the parameter count by\n$93.75\\%$ without compromising performance, accelerates convergence, and\nimportantly, maintains the inference computational cost equivalent to the\nclassical FDK algorithm. Our method not only ensures volumetric consistency and\nboosts robustness to noise, but is also designed for straightforward\nintegration into existing CT reconstruction pipelines. This presents a\npragmatic enhancement that can benefit clinical applications, particularly in\nenvironments with computational limitations."}

The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities\nin current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of\nreasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction\nfor developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important\nimplications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications\nas these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even\nwithout adversarial prompts."}

It\nensures that both positive and negative signals contribute, treating the\nactivation vector as a whole. Depending on the application, several variations\nof this technique are presented, with a resolution scale hyperparameter to\nprobe different angular scales. Using this method, multiple examples are\nprovided that demonstrate embedded representations tend to be axis-aligned with\nthe privileged basis.

Evaluations on Office-Home\nshow that our method consistently outperforms CLIP baseline and standard\nbaseline. Ablation studies confirm the gradient norm's critical role."}

Uni-Retrieval extracts\nquery style features as prototypes and builds a continuously updated Prompt\nBank containing prompt tokens for diverse queries. This bank can updated during\ntest time to represent domain-specific knowledge for different subject\nretrieval scenarios. Our framework demonstrates scalability and robustness by\ndynamically retrieving prompt tokens based on prototype similarity, effectively\nfacilitating learning for unknown queries. Experimental results indicate that\nUni-Retrieval outperforms existing retrieval models in most retrieval tasks.\nThis advancement provides a scalable and precise solution for diverse\neducational needs."}

Traditionally, this process has relied on extracting a\nspeaker embedding from a reference speech, in which a speaker recognition model\nis required. However, identifying an appropriate speaker recognition model can\nbe challenging, and using the target speaker embedding as reference information\nmay not be optimal for target speaker extraction tasks. This paper introduces a\nUniversal Speaker Embedding-Free Target Speaker Extraction (USEF-TSE) framework\nthat operates without relying on speaker embeddings. USEF-TSE utilizes a\nmulti-head cross-attention mechanism as a frame-level target speaker feature\nextractor. This innovative approach allows mainstream speaker extraction\nsolutions to bypass the dependency on speaker recognition models and better\nleverage the information available in the enrollment speech, including speaker\ncharacteristics and contextual details. Additionally, USEF-TSE can seamlessly\nintegrate with other time-domain or time-frequency domain speech separation\nmodels to achieve effective speaker extraction. Experimental results show that\nour proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of\nScale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) on the WSJ0-2mix, WHAM!,\nand WHAMR! datasets, which are standard benchmarks for monaural anechoic, noisy\nand noisy-reverberant two-speaker speech separation and speaker extraction.

Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those of\ntheir corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation. Therefore,\nthis positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it encodes too\nmuch information regarding the recording source in the learned representations.\nThis article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a\nbootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives in SSL\nframeworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the\nrepresentation space, under the assumption that these pseudo-positives belong\nto the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions.\nThis method demonstrates consistent improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb\nbenchmarks when implemented in major SSL frameworks, such as SimCLR, SwAV,\nVICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR, and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on\nVoxCeleb1-O. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable\nperformance to DINO with a simpler training framework.

In contrast, Land-MoE addresses these issues by\nhierarchically inserting a Frequency-aware Mixture of Low-rank Token Experts,\nto fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in a parameter-efficient manner.\nSpecifically, Land-MoE comprises two key modules: the mixture of low-rank token\nexperts (MoLTE) and frequency-aware filters (FAF). MoLTE leverages\nrank-differentiated tokens to generate diverse feature adjustments for\nindividual instances within multispectral images. By dynamically combining\nlearnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness\nagainst spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on\nthe refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture\nfrequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence,\nwhile simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task.\nComprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and\ncross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods\nby a large margin. Additionally, the proposed approach has also achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance in domain generalization semantic segmentation\ntasks of RGB remote sensing images."}

DRP uses a\nteacher model to perform skill-aware step decomposition and content pruning,\nand then distills the pruned reasoning paths into a student model, enabling it\nto reason both efficiently and accurately. Across several challenging\nmathematical reasoning datasets, we find that models trained with DRP achieve\nsubstantial improvements in token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.\nSpecifically, DRP reduces average token usage on GSM8K from 917 to 328 while\nimproving accuracy from 91.7% to 94.1%, and achieves a 43% token reduction on\nAIME with no performance drop.

Therefore, we\npropose an embarrassingly simple but effective method that decouples the\nstandard classifier into two heads. Then, these two individual heads are\ncapable of independently addressing clear positive samples and noisy negative\nsamples which are caused by the missing label. In this way, the model can\neffectively learn novel classes while mitigating the effects of noisy negative\nsamples. Without bells and whistles, our model without any additional\ncomputation cost and parameters consistently outperforms its baseline and\nstate-of-the-art by a large margin on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks for\nFSOD and FSIS tasks.

To advance\nthis line of inquiry, this work explores how two possible causal factors --\ndataset overlap and task overlap -- influence downstream model similarity. The\nexploration of dataset overlap is motivated by the reality that large-scale\ngenerative AI models are often trained on overlapping datasets of scraped\ninternet data, while the exploration of task overlap seeks to substantiate\nclaims from a recent work, the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, that task\nsimilarity may drive model similarity. We evaluate the effects of both factors\nthrough a broad set of experiments. We find that both positively correlate with\nhigher representational similarity and that combining them provides the\nstrongest effect. Our code and dataset are published."}

One common solution is to\nperform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the\nsemantic content between real and synthetic images.

Attention is a\npowerful cognitive ability that allows agents to focus on potentially complex\ninformation, such as logically structured propositions, higher-order beliefs,\nor what other agents pay attention to.

Existing dynamic epistemic\nlogics for attention cannot model such complex attention scenarios, as they\nonly model attention to atomic formulas. Additionally, such logics quickly\nbecome cumbersome, as their size grows exponentially in the number of agents\nand announced literals. Here, we introduce a logic that overcomes both\nlimitations. First, we generalize edge-conditioned event models, which we show\nto be as expressive as standard event models yet exponentially more succinct\n(generalizing both standard event models and generalized arrow updates).\nSecond, we extend attention to arbitrary formulas, allowing agents to also\nattend to other agents' beliefs or attention.

Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the\nunbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the\ngeneralization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and\nobserve three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The\nfirst problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular\ndepth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular\nfeature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity\nupdate leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map\ncould alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed\nat the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we\npropose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the\ndepth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute\ndepth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight\nthe initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem.

Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful\nresponses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than\nDirect Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot\nvariant that requires no fine-tuning.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach that effectively\ndisentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual\nfidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and\nface styles, beating the current state of the art by $\\geq 59.46\\%$ under a\ncommon training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on\nmorphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real\nmorphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six\ndatasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our\nmethod."}

To improve the prediction accuracy, this study introduces\na PID-controlled tensor wheel decomposition (PTWD) model, which mainly adopts\nthe following two ideas: 1) exploiting the representation power of TWD to\ncapture the latent features of dynamic network topology and weight evolution,\nand 2) integrating the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control principle\ninto the optimization process to obtain a stable model parameter learning\nscheme. The performance on four real datasets verifies that the proposed PTWD\nmodel has more accurate link prediction capabilities compared to other models."}

Quantization-aware training (QAT)\naddresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining\nperformance.

Existing QAT scaling laws often\nignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization\ngranularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified\nscaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,\ntraining data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,\nwe show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises\nwith more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the\nsources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation\ncomponents. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization\nerror, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization\nerror increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows\nthat the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is\nthe primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error.

We adapt LAC from its original\nefficiency-focused application to trace activated layers during inference. This\nmethod monitors changes in the L2-norm of activations to identify voids. We\nanalyze layer activation in instruction-tuned LMs across two phases: Prompt\nProcessing (PP), where we trace activated layers for each token in the input\nprompts, and Response Generation (RG), where we trace activated layers for each\ngenerated token. We further demonstrate that distinct layers are activated\nduring these two phases. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated\nthree distinct instruction-tuned LMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families\non three benchmarks: MMLU, GPQA Diamond, and BoolQ. For example, on MMLU with a\nzero-shot setting, skipping voids in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct resulted in an\nimprovement from 69.24 to 71.29 while the model uses only 30% of the layers.\nSimilarly, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 on GPQA Diamond improved from 13.88 to\n18.36 when using 70% of the layers during both the PP and RG phases.

Our study shows that\nthe existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain\nscenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training\ndata and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the\nvision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two\npre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize\nto out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by\nDINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression.\nTo overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we\npropose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This\nenables OpenVLA -- which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during\ninitial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this\ncapability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77\\%\nand 66\\% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks.

This framework combines the\npredictive power of DL with the interpretability of traditional SD models,\nresulting in both causal reliability and scalability.

Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning\nwith theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image\ngeneration. However, unlike object customization, which focuses on learning\nspecific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such\nas characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key\nchallenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and\ncontinuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often\ncome with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of\noverfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation\nmodels directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large\nlanguage models use text as context? To address this, we present IP-Prompter, a\nnovel training-free TSI generation method. IP-Prompter introduces visual\nprompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models,\nallowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring\nadditional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic\nVisual Prompting (DVP) mechanism, which iteratively optimizes visual prompts to\nimprove the accuracy and quality of generated images.

However, the hallucination of code generation models is rarely\nconsidered. One critical bottleneck in considering code hallucination is the\nintricate property of code to identify whether generated code has the intended\nfunctionality due to its un-natural form, different to natural languages.\nHandful of unit tests have been considered to address this issue, but\nscaling-up its size is extremely expensive. We address this core bottleneck by\nautomatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, which\nleverages the \\emph{executable nature} of code.

To address these\nlimits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM),\na new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash\nor risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the\nextent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe\nextreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by\ncontext-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road\nusers. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails\nhigher risk of potential collision. Then a context-adaptive risk score and its\nassociated probability can be calculated based on the theory of extreme values.\nAny measurable factors, such as motion kinematics, weather, lighting, can serve\nas part of the context, allowing for diverse coverage of safety-critical\ninteractions. Multiple public driving datasets are used to train GSSMs, which\nare tested with 4,875 real-world crashes and near-crashes reconstructed from\nthe SHRP2 NDS.

Electrocardiography (ECG), a widely\navailable and non-invasive tool, can enable the detection of liver disease by\ncapturing cardiovascular-hepatic interactions.\n  Methods: We trained tree-based machine learning models on ECG features to\ndetect liver diseases using two large datasets: MIMIC-IV-ECG (467,729 patients,\n2008-2019) and ECG-View II (775,535 patients, 1994-2013). The task was framed\nas binary classification, with performance evaluated via the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To improve interpretability,\nwe applied explainability methods to identify key predictive features.\n  Findings: The models showed strong predictive performance with good\ngeneralizability. For example, AUROCs for alcoholic liver disease (K70) were\n0.8025 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8020-0.8035) internally and 0.7644 (95%\nCI, 0.7641-0.7649) externally; for hepatic failure (K72), scores were 0.7404\n(95% CI, 0.7389-0.7415) and 0.7498 (95% CI, 0.7494-0.7509), respectively.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference.

Benchmarking studies on multiple datasets are needed to reveal\nstrengths and limitations of commonly used methods. Existing DSM studies\nusually rely on a single dataset with restricted access, leading to incomplete\nand potentially misleading conclusions. To address these issues, we introduce\nan open-access dataset collection called Precision Liming Soil Datasets\n(LimeSoDa). LimeSoDa consists of 31 field- and farm-scale datasets from various\ncountries. Each dataset has three target soil properties: (1) soil organic\nmatter or soil organic carbon, (2) clay content and (3) pH, alongside a set of\nfeatures. Features are dataset-specific and were obtained by optical\nspectroscopy, proximal- and remote soil sensing. All datasets were aligned to a\ntabular format and are ready-to-use for modeling. We demonstrated the use of\nLimeSoDa for benchmarking by comparing the predictive performance of four\nlearning algorithms across all datasets. This comparison included multiple\nlinear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), categorical boosting\n(CatBoost) and random forest (RF). The results showed that although no single\nalgorithm was universally superior, certain algorithms performed better in\nspecific contexts.

The threat of backdoor attacks on symbol reconstruction in\nsemantic communication (SemCom) systems has received limited attention.\nPrevious research on backdoor attacks targeting SemCom symbol reconstruction\nprimarily focuses on input-level triggers, which are impractical in scenarios\nwith strict input constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel\nchannel-triggered backdoor attack (CT-BA) framework that exploits inherent\nwireless channel characteristics as activation triggers.

To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model\ndesigned to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of\ngenerating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort\nreadability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content\ngeneration. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text\nRepresentation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while\npreserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict\nfuture GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding\ntext.
