### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil, Salomé Andres, Atul Anand, Bruce Guthrie, Huayu Zhang, Abul Hasan, Honghan Wu, Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from elderly patients' discharge summaries is introduced, addressing underrepresented populations and complex annotation challenges. Transformer models perform well on coarse tasks but struggle with fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical NLP resources and tackle challenges like discontinuous and overlapping entities in AE extraction.

Method: A dataset with 14 clinically significant AEs was annotated, and models (e.g., BERT-cased) were evaluated using FlairNLP across three granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation.

Result: Transformer models achieved strong performance on coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943) but dropped for fine-grained tasks (F1 = 0.675), especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite high-level performance, challenges persist in detecting underrepresented AEs and nuanced clinical language. The dataset serves as a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota, Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) improves structured NLP tasks by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases, leveraging complementary errors for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structured NLP tasks rely on implicit constraints during training, leading to low-quality outputs during constrained decoding. BoostCD addresses this by explicitly combining constrained and unconstrained decoding.

Method: BoostCD uses a two-phase approach: Phase 1 generates weak predictions from the base model in constrained and unconstrained modes. Phase 2 employs a boosted model to combine these predictions into a final output.

Result: BoostCD, applied to closed information extraction (BoostIE), outperforms prior methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing common errors.

Conclusion: BoostCD effectively improves structured NLP task performance by leveraging complementary decoding strategies, demonstrating its superiority in closed information extraction.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila, Shuai Zhang, Boran Han, Bonan Min, Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst is a weakly supervised framework for assessing context document credibility in LLMs, improving accuracy and F1 scores without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore varying credibility of context documents, risking unreliable information propagation.

Method: CrEst uses inter-document agreement for automated credibility estimation and integrates it into LLM inference via black-box and white-box strategies.

Result: CrEst outperforms baselines, achieving up to 26.86% accuracy and 3.49% F1 score improvements, even under high noise.

Conclusion: CrEst effectively enhances LLM performance by addressing context credibility, proving robust in noisy conditions.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper, Wenzhao Qiu, Ali Payani, Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench is a new synthetic dataset for evaluating multi-document reasoning in LLMs, created using a novel generation process to address the lack of benchmarks in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multi-document reasoning are scarce due to high annotation costs, despite its relevance for LLMs.

Method: MDBench uses a synthetic generation process with LLM-assisted edits on structured seed knowledge to create document sets and QA examples.

Result: MDBench challenges current LLMs and prompting techniques, even with short documents, and enables targeted analysis.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique is adaptable for future challenges and model improvements.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib, Oishy Fatema Akhand, Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores LLMs for diabetes prediction using PIDD, comparing six LLMs (open-source and proprietary) with traditional ML models. Proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B outperform others, but challenges like prompting variability remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes from structured numerical data, an area not well explored, and compare their performance with traditional ML models.

Method: Empirical analysis using PIDD, evaluating six LLMs (Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-2B, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) and three ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) via zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting. Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Result: Proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma-2-27B) outperform open-source LLMs and traditional ML models in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B excels in F1-score. Performance varies with prompting strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for medical prediction tasks, but require prompt engineering and hybrid approaches for better healthcare predictions.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre, Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate reversible sentence embeddings using a memory token, enabling exact text reconstruction without weight modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capability to reconstruct original text from embeddings without altering model weights.

Method: Introduce a memory token optimized through training on fixed sequences; evaluate across languages, token lengths, and model scales.

Result: Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs sequences up to ~240 tokens in English and Spanish.

Conclusion: This capability has potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker, Swati Rajwal, Sudeshna Das, Snigdha Peddireddy, Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify social isolation and loneliness in suicide narratives, revealing higher risks for men, gay individuals, and divorced people.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured data on social isolation and loneliness in suicide cases, leveraging NLP for better surveillance and prevention.

Method: Topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers to analyze NVDRS narratives.

Result: High-quality classifiers (F1: .86, accuracy: .82) identified 1,198 cases of chronic social isolation, with higher odds for specific demographics.

Conclusion: NLP methods can enhance surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in suicide cases.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li, Yapei Chang, Yuhang Zhou, Xiyang Wu, Zichao Liang, Yoo Yeon Sung, Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT is a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation, outperforming traditional metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore by aligning better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating long-form generation often miss key aspects like coherence and relevance or are biased by pretraining data, creating a gap in reliable evaluation.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on diverse long-form response datasets with Likert-rated quality, providing semantic reward feedback for GRPO training.

Result: PrefBERT shows reliability across varied long passages and aligns well with human preferences, outperforming traditional metrics in evaluations.

Conclusion: PrefBERT effectively addresses the evaluation gap in long-form generation, offering a better reward signal for training policy models aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu, Konstantin Garov, Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding affect the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning specific knowledge in LLMs is crucial for privacy, compliance, and correcting harmful content, but prior work assumes fixed training and models. This study investigates how knowledge encoding impacts unlearning.

Method: Empirical experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of learning-time choices, focusing on paraphrased descriptions and unlearning from text chunks.

Result: Key findings: (1) paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning performance, and (2) unlearning individual knowledge from text chunks is difficult.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding is critical for reliable post-hoc unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Language Models: Advancing Cooperation, Coordination, and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09331)
*Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs possess a theory of mind by investigating their ability to model and reason about others' intentions, using cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance collaboration between AI and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding if LLMs can infer intentions is crucial for effective collaboration, which is essential for human-AI interaction and societal success.

Method: The study uses cooperative MARL with LLM-based agents to simulate and analyze collaboration, mirroring human social reasoning.

Result: The approach aims to improve AI's adaptability and cooperation with both artificial and human partners, advancing hybrid human-AI systems.

Conclusion: The work has broad implications for future human-artificial interaction, fostering seamless collaboration through enhanced theory of mind in LLMs.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

### [11] [PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models through Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15556)
*Shufan Li, Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PredGen reduces latency in LLM-based voice chat by generating candidate responses while the user speaks, cutting delay by ~2x with minimal extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the noticeable latency in LLM-TTS systems for real-time voice chat, especially on consumer hardware.

Method: Proposes Predictive Generation (PredGen), using speculative decoding to generate responses during user speech.

Result: Simulated experiments show ~2x latency reduction with minimal added computation.

Conclusion: PredGen effectively mitigates latency in LLM-TTS systems, enhancing user experience.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

### [12] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan, Peifeng Li, Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve dialogue discourse parsing by resolving ambiguities from linguistic features like omission and idiom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linguistic features in dialogues (e.g., omission, idiom) create ambiguities in discourse relations, challenging parsers.

Method: Proposes DCM for clarification reasoning (type and goal) and CPO to mitigate erroneous clarifications.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines on STAC and Molweni datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively resolves ambiguities and enhances parser performance.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang, Hongshun Ling, Li Zhang, Longqian Zhang, Fang Wang, Yuan Gao, Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CKD-EHR, a framework using knowledge distillation to enhance EHR-based disease prediction, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing insufficient medical knowledge representation and low clinical deployment efficiency in existing models.

Method: Fine-tunes Qwen2.5-7B as a teacher model, uses multi-granularity attention distillation, and transfers knowledge to a lightweight BERT student model.

Result: On MIMIC-III, CKD-EHR boosts diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and achieves 22.2x faster inference.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR improves clinical resource efficiency and diagnostic accuracy, offering a practical solution for healthcare.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [14] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee, Kong-Aik Lee, Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage framework for Open-domain Dialogue (OD) generation, addressing the one-to-many (o2m) property by decomposing it into Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS). It introduces o2mDial, a corpus for MRG and PS, and new evaluation metrics, improving response diversity and quality in smaller LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based dialogue agents ignore the o2m property of OD, which limits response diversity. This work aims to explicitly model o2m to enhance diversity and coherence.

Method: Decompose OD generation into MRG (generating diverse responses) and PS (selecting based on human preference). Introduce o2mDial corpus, in-context learning, instruction-tuning, and novel metrics for MRG and PS.

Result: The framework improves response diversity and quality by up to 90% in smaller LLMs, matching larger models' performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling o2m in OD generation via MRG and PS enhances diversity and coherence, making smaller LLMs competitive with larger ones.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho, Yeonkyoun So, Chanwoo Park, Sangmin Lee, Sungmok Jung, Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok is a Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility by 10% without performance loss, using rule-based pre-tokenization and a branching entropy-based algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient tokenizer for Korean that reduces token fertility (number of tokens) while maintaining model performance.

Method: Uses rule-based pre-tokenization aligned with Korean linguistic structure, a seed vocabulary of linguistic-like tokens, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Reduces fertility by ~10% (improves inference speed by 10%) without performance loss in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for efficient tokenizer design.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

TL;DR: Seewo's system improves ASR and SD-ASR using multi-stage training with curriculum learning, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation, and RLVR, achieving significant WER/CER reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning and self-correction in speech language models for ASR and SD-ASR tasks.

Method: Multi-stage training pipeline with curriculum learning, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).

Result: Achieved WER/CER of 11.57% (Track 1) and tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% (Track 2), outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed components are effective under challenge constraints, demonstrating substantial improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents Seewo's systems for both tracks of the Multilingual
Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge (MLC-SLM), addressing automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization with ASR (SD-ASR). We
introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that explicitly enhances reasoning
and self-correction in speech language models for ASR. Our approach combines
curriculum learning for progressive capability acquisition, Chain-of-Thought
data augmentation to foster intermediate reflection, and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further refine self-correction through
reward-driven optimization. This approach achieves substantial improvements
over the official challenge baselines. On the evaluation set, our best system
attains a WER/CER of 11.57% for Track 1 and a tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% for Track
2. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component under challenge constraints.

### [17] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga, Hilal AlQuabeh, Munachiso S Nwadike, Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates memory mechanisms in state-space language models, revealing U-shaped accuracy profiles in recall tasks due to primacy and recency effects. It identifies three key mechanisms: sparse long-term memory channels, delta-modulated short-term memory, and dynamic memory allocation based on semantic regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models, using behavioral tools like primacy and recency effects.

Method: Structured recall tasks applied to the Mamba architecture, with targeted ablations and input perturbations on models with 1.4B and 7B parameters.

Result: A U-shaped accuracy profile is observed, with strong performance at sequence start and end. Three mechanisms are identified: sparse long-term memory channels, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory, and dynamic modulation by semantic regularity.

Conclusion: The study uncovers distinct mechanisms governing memory in state-space models, highlighting the interplay of long-term and short-term memory, and the role of semantic context in memory allocation.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

*Andrea Cadeddu, Alessandro Chessa, Vincenzo De Leo, Gianni Fenu, Enrico Motta, Francesco Osborne, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Angelo Salatino, Luca Secchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for SDG-related text classification, comparing proprietary and open-source models, and testing task adaptation techniques like Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning. Smaller models with optimized prompts can match larger models like GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking progress toward the UN's SDGs is challenging due to data complexity. Text classification models, especially LLMs, are essential for automating analysis.

Method: Analyzes various LLMs for SDG-focused text classification and evaluates task adaptation techniques (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, Fine-Tuning).

Result: Smaller models with prompt optimization perform as well as larger models like GPT.

Conclusion: Optimized smaller LLMs are viable for SDG text classification, offering efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

*Feng He, Zijun Chen, Xinnian Liang, Tingting Ma, Yunqi Qiu, Shuangzhi Wu, Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning improves LLMs' reasoning by using abstract prototypes, showing gains in logical, planning, general reasoning, and math tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enhance cross-domain generalization in Large Reasoning Models by leveraging shared abstract reasoning prototypes.

Method: Proposes ProtoReasoning, a framework with automated prototype construction, verification, and scalability, using Prolog and PDDL.

Result: Achieves 4.7% (logical), 6.3% (planning), 4.0% (general reasoning), and 1.0% (math) improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Reasoning prototypes enhance generalization, validating their role as foundational for generalizable reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [20] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan, Yating Wang, Guandong Wang, Jie Zhai, Jingping Liu, Qi Ye, Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval is a novel method for evaluating open-ended QA, distinguishing factoid and non-factoid questions and using tailored strategies for each, outperforming traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for open-ended QA lack interpretability and fail to distinguish between factoid and non-factoid questions, leading to inaccurate assessments.

Method: MinosEval classifies questions into factoid and non-factoid, applying adaptive key-point scoring for the former and instance-aware listwise ranking for the latter.

Result: Experiments show MinosEval aligns better with human judgments and provides more interpretable results than traditional metrics.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses limitations of current evaluation methods, offering a more refined and interpretable approach for open-ended QA.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea, Itziar Gonzalez-Dios, Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates language technologies' ability to understand Basque and Spanish varieties, revealing performance drops due to linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well current language technologies handle linguistic variations in Basque and Spanish, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Method: Uses a manually-curated parallel dataset for Basque and Spanish, testing crosslingual and in-context learning with encoder-only and decoder-based LLMs.

Result: Performance declines with linguistic variation, particularly in Basque, due to the variation itself rather than lexical overlap. Encoder-only models struggle most with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Linguistic variation poses challenges for language models, with peripheral dialects like Western Basque being harder to process. Data and code are publicly shared.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain knowledge gaps in large language models for historical text analysis in computational humanities and AIGC technology.

Method: Proposes Graph RAG framework with chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a dataset and improve model alignment with historical knowledge.

Result: The domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieved F1=0.68 in relation extraction. GraphRAG improved F1 by 11% on C-CLUE dataset, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Graph RAG provides a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, benefiting historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness in large-scale QA systems by leveraging clustering and multi-stage prompt aggregation.

Method: Hybrid retrieval (sparse/dense indices), K-Means clustering, cluster-specific prompts for LLM, intermediate answer filtering/reranking, and synthesis.

Result: Ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation improve large-scale RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

*Sungen Hahm, Heejin Kim, Gyuseong Lee, Hyunji Park, Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thunder-DeID, a framework for de-identifying court judgments in South Korea to balance open justice and data protection, addressing current inadequacies with a DNN-based pipeline and legal dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current de-identification processes in South Korea are insufficient for large-scale court judgments and lack clear legal definitions for technical solutions.

Method: Proposes Thunder-DeID, which includes creating a Korean legal dataset, categorizing PII, and developing a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID effectively addresses legal and technical challenges in de-identifying court judgments while complying with laws.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys LLM-based approaches for clinical trial-patient matching, highlighting their potential and current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for improving clinical trial recruitment by leveraging their knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities, but adoption is limited due to proprietary models and weak benchmarks.

Method: The survey analyzes trial-patient matching, existing benchmarks, LLM-based approaches, and evaluation frameworks.

Result: The paper identifies challenges in adopting LLMs for clinical research and suggests future directions.

Conclusion: LLMs hold potential for trial-patient matching, but better benchmarks and open models are needed for broader adoption.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages perform poorly in LID due to class imbalance and bias, often limited to single-domain data like the Bible.

Method: Proposes a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages.

Result: Improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The SCL approach effectively enhances LID models for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeVisE is a framework to evaluate LLMs' clinical reasoning by testing sensitivity to demographic and vital sign changes in ICU notes. It reveals zero-shot models reason better, while fine-tuned ones are stable but less responsive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations lack depth in distinguishing genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns, risking unreliable clinical decision support.

Method: DeVisE uses MIMIC-IV ICU notes, creating real-world and synthetic versions with controlled counterfactuals (demographics, vitals). Tests five LLMs on input-level sensitivity and downstream reasoning (hospital stay prediction).

Result: Zero-shot models show coherent reasoning; fine-tuned ones are stable but less responsive. Demographic factors subtly influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing like DeVisE is crucial for safer, transparent clinical AI, highlighting fairness-aware evaluation needs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

TL;DR: SANSKRITI is a benchmark dataset to evaluate language models' understanding of India's cultural diversity, revealing gaps in their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models lack local socio-cultural context, especially for India's diverse culture, necessitating a specialized evaluation tool.

Method: Created SANSKRITI, a dataset with 21,853 question-answer pairs covering 16 cultural attributes across India's regions.

Result: Leading language models showed significant disparities in handling culturally nuanced queries, often struggling with regional specifics.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI provides a comprehensive standard for improving cultural understanding in language models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

TL;DR: COSMMIC is a novel comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset for nine Indian languages, integrating articles, images, and user comments to enhance summarization. It uses advanced models like LLama3 and GPT-4 to evaluate configurations and improve NLG tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research in Indian languages for comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization, bridging gaps in resources and fostering inclusivity.

Method: Introduces COSMMIC dataset with 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 comments. Evaluates four summarization configurations (text-only, text+comments, text+images, all combined) using LLama3, GPT-4, IndicBERT, and CLIP-based classifiers.

Result: Identifies effective configurations for summarization by integrating reader insights, filtering noise, and extracting image insights, advancing NLP research in Indian languages.

Conclusion: COSMMIC uniquely combines text, images, and user feedback, filling a critical gap in Indian language resources and enhancing multimodal, multilingual summarization.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Kutay Ertürk, Furkan Altınışık, İrem Sarıaltın, Ömer Nezih Gerek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TSLFormer is a lightweight Turkish Sign Language recognition model using 3D joint positions for efficient input, treating signs as sequences and achieving competitive performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to simplify and improve sign language recognition by leveraging 3D joint positions and sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by linguistic properties and transformer success in NLP.

Method: TSLFormer uses 3D joint positions (from Mediapipe) as input, treating sign gestures as sequences. It employs a transformer-based self-attention mechanism to capture temporal patterns.

Result: Evaluated on AUTSL (36k samples, 227 words), TSLFormer performs competitively with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Joint-based input is sufficient for real-time, mobile assistive systems for hearing-impaired individuals.

Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign
Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered,
string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only
works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's
Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This
creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important
semantic gesture information. Our approach revisits sign language recognition
as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign
languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since
TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal
co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion
patterns as words unfold. Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000
samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance
with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is
sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems
for hearing-impaired individuals.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning method to improve lexical alignment in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Swahili, using early-layer embeddings and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in LRLs due to data scarcity. The paper aims to enhance cross-lingual lexical alignment for tasks like translation.

Method: TLI uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to fine-tune embeddings from an optimal early layer (Layer 2) in a Swahili-centric LLM.

Result: TLI improves lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs, increasing cosine similarity by ~28% for both trained and unseen word pairs.

Conclusion: TLI is a parameter-efficient strategy to enhance cross-lingual knowledge in LRL-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

*Xingjian Tao, Yiwei Wang, Yujun Cai, Zhicheng Yang, Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework and metric (PSS) to evaluate and improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI agents, addressing hallucinations and enhancing reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs for GUI agents often suffer from systematic localization errors (hallucinations), reducing reliability. Existing metrics lack nuance in capturing these failures.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained evaluation framework, the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), and Context-Aware Cropping to refine input context without training.

Result: The framework reveals nuanced failure modes, and PSS improves uncertainty quantification. Context-Aware Cropping enhances model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer actionable insights, improving interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentGroupChat-V2 is a novel multi-agent framework addressing challenges in architecture, generalizability, and performance with innovations like parallel task decomposition, adaptive collaboration, and optimization strategies, achieving superior results in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems struggle with architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, especially as task complexity and agent numbers grow.

Method: The framework introduces a divide-and-conquer parallel architecture, adaptive collaboration engine, and agent organization optimization strategies.

Result: Achieves 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K, 30.4% on AIME, and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval, with performance improving with task difficulty.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 offers an efficient, general-purpose solution for LLM multi-agent systems, excelling in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

*Xinnuo Xu, Rachel Lawrence, Kshitij Dubey, Atharva Pandey, Risa Ueno, Fabian Falck, Aditya V. Nori, Rahul Sharma, Amit Sharma, Javier Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE is a framework to assess LLMs' reasoning hierarchy, revealing reliance on statistical recall rather than true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether LLMs' high accuracy stems from true reasoning or memorization, inspired by Pearl's ladder of causation.

Method: Introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework with an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different reasoning levels (associations, interventions, counterfactuals).

Result: Performance drops on problem variations, indicating reliance on statistical recall.

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE highlights LLMs' limitations in reasoning, encouraging further research on hierarchical reasoning skills.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CINGS is a post-training method that improves grounding in LLMs by training them with relevant context prepended to responses, masking the context during loss computation. It enhances performance in textual and visual domains without degrading general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to ground responses in external context when it's simply appended at inference time, leading to hallucinations or ungrounded outputs.

Method: Proposes CINGS, where models are trained with context prepended to responses, but loss is computed only over response tokens, masking the context.

Result: CINGS outperforms other methods in 11 textual datasets and reduces hallucinations in vision-language tasks, maintaining factual consistency.

Conclusion: CINGS effectively shifts model behavior to rely more on external context, improving grounding without harming general performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARE introduces a structured framework for efficient, high-quality automated process annotation in LLMs, improving reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), aligning solution steps to reference solutions with explicit reasoning for evaluation.

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance and efficiency, achieving competitive results with 2.6 times greater efficiency than tree search-based methods.

Conclusion: SPARE is a promising framework for process supervision, with potential for broader applications in LLM training and evaluation.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [37] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng, Sihang Wang, Hao Fei, Zuquan Peng, Fei Li, Jianming Fu, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for detecting hyperbole and metaphor in text, outperforming existing methods by leveraging emotion analysis and bidirectional dynamic interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hyperbole and metaphor detection focus on superficial text features, neglecting emotional associations and implicit meanings, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: EmoBi integrates emotion analysis, domain mapping, and bidirectional dynamic interaction to enhance detection, with a verification mechanism for accuracy.

Result: EmoBi achieves significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 28.1% for hyperbole and 23.1% for metaphor detection compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and potential for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection in NLP tasks.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning to improve grounding in large language models (LLMs), addressing issues like incorrect citations and refusal errors. The GRPO method, combined with stage-wise training and GPT-4 distillation, enhances answer correctness and citation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge is improving the groundedness and trustworthiness of LLM responses, as current methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often fail in straightforward scenarios.

Method: The study employs GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) for training models using verifiable outcome-based rewards. A two-stage training setup is used: first optimizing answer and citation behavior, then refusal. GPT-4 distillation is also revisited.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. Combining GRPO with GPT-4 distillation improves performance on long-form QA tasks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

*Bailin Wang, Chang Lan, Chong Wang, Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION improves local-global attention models by integrating linear attention to capture out-of-window tokens, achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoffs with smaller window sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of local attention ignoring tokens outside the window, aiming to enhance efficiency without performance loss.

Method: Introduces RATTENTION, combining local attention with a linear attention mechanism to handle out-of-window tokens.

Result: RATTENTION with a 512 window size matches full-attention performance, improves long-context handling, and maintains training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION shifts the Pareto frontier, offering superior efficiency and performance in local-global attention models.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gradient-based method to approximate training data from model weights, improving performance on tasks like classification and supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data, creating a need to approximate data from model weights.

Method: A gradient-based approach selects high-matching data from a public corpus, tested on classification and supervised fine-tuning tasks.

Result: The method improves classification performance from 65% to 80% and reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, nearing expert benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively recovers useful training data from model weights, achieving near-expert performance.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI) to evaluate gender fairness in LLMs, covering binary and non-binary genders, and tests 22 models to reveal biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive metrics for evaluating gender inclusivity in LLMs, especially beyond binary distinctions.

Method: Develops GIFI, a multi-level evaluation metric, and applies it to 22 LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities.

Result: Significant variations in gender inclusivity across models, highlighting biases and the need for improvement.

Conclusion: GIFI serves as a critical benchmark for advancing gender fairness in LLMs.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSG, a task for discourse-level text scene graph parsing, and DiscoSG-Refiner, a method to improve parsing efficiency and accuracy over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene graph parsers fail to handle cross-sentence coreference in multi-sentence descriptions, leading to fragmented graphs and poor VLM performance.

Method: Proposes DiscoSG-Refiner: a two-step approach using small PLMs to draft and iteratively refine graphs, reducing computational cost.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by 30% over baselines and is 86x faster than GPT-4, while enhancing downstream VLM tasks.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient, scalable solution for discourse-level scene graph parsing, with open-source code and data.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WikiMixQA is a benchmark of 1,000 MCQs evaluating cross-modal reasoning over tables/charts from Wikipedia. It highlights challenges in long-context, multi-modal reasoning, with GPT-4-o performing best (~50% accuracy) and open-source models lagging (~27%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating complex cross-modal reasoning in document understanding, especially for long-context inputs.

Method: Created WikiMixQA with 1,000 MCQs from 4,000 Wikipedia pages across seven topics, testing 12 vision-language models.

Result: Proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-o) perform better (~70% with direct context, ~50% with retrieval), while open-source models max at 27%.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA is a vital benchmark for advancing document understanding, revealing significant challenges in long-context, multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI to automate MCQ creation for Portuguese reading comprehension, evaluating quality and reliability through expert review and student responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MCQ creation is time-consuming and costly, with limited focus on non-English languages and quality assessment of AI-generated MCQs.

Method: Generative models produce MCQs for Portuguese, evaluated via expert review and psychometric analysis of student responses.

Result: Models generate MCQs comparable to human-authored ones but face issues with semantic clarity, answerability, and distractor quality.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise for MCQ creation in Portuguese, but improvements are needed in distractor design and clarity.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

*Xiangxiang Cui, Shu Yang, Tianjin Huang, Wanyu Lin, Lijie Hu, Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies regret in large language models, proposing methods to identify and analyze regret expressions and neurons, addressing dataset and metric challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding regret mechanisms in LLMs enhances model reliability and reveals neural cognition coding.

Method: Proposes workflow for regret dataset construction, S-CDI metric for optimal regret layer identification, and RDS/GIC metrics for neuron analysis.

Result: Identified optimal regret layer with S-CDI, discovered M-shaped decoupling pattern, and categorized neurons into regret, non-regret, and dual types.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address key challenges in regret analysis, improving understanding of regret mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino, Matthias Hofer, Max Siegel, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation arise from both literal meanings and pragmatic factors like utterance cost, not just semantics or politeness norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether cross-cultural misunderstandings stem from literal word meanings or broader pragmatic factors like politeness and brevity.

Method: Three experiments with British and American English speakers, supported by a computational cognitive model analyzing informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: Differences in intensifier interpretation are due to varying literal meanings and weights on utterance cost, not just semantics or politeness norms.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural interpretation differences result from a complex interplay between literal meanings and pragmatic factors.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [48] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow concept order instructions and compositional generalization. It found biases in LLMs leading to low-diversity outputs and only 75% ordered coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization in generative commonsense reasoning tasks, where concept order adherence is crucial.

Method: Proposed Ordered CommonGen benchmark, measuring ordered coverage of concepts in generated sentences. Evaluated 36 LLMs.

Result: LLMs showed biases in concept order, leading to low-diversity outputs. The best LLM achieved only ~75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in instruction-following and compositional generalization, as current performance is suboptimal.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

*Dana Lupsa, Sanda-Maria Avram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates six ML techniques for Romanian authorship attribution using the ROST corpus, with ANN achieving the best performance, including perfect classification in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address authorship attribution for Romanian texts using lightweight, interpretable methods.

Method: Evaluated SVM, LR, k-NN, DT, RF, and ANN with character n-gram features.

Result: ANN performed best, achieving perfect classification in some runs with 5-gram features.

Conclusion: Simple stylometric features can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, even in resource-constrained or under-studied languages.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

### [50] [CC-LEARN: Cohort-based Consistency Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15662)
*Xiao Ye, Shaswat Shrivastava, Zhaonan Li, Jacob Dineen, Shijie Lu, Avneet Ahuja, Ming Shen, Zhikun Xu, Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CC-Learn improves LLM reasoning consistency using reinforcement learning on cohorts of similar questions, outperforming baselines in accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with consistent and robust reasoning, prompting the need for methods like CC-Learn to enhance reliability.

Method: CC-Learn uses reinforcement learning with a composite objective (cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, rejection penalty) to train on cohorts of similar questions.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, StrategyQA) show improved accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

### [51] [Leaky Thoughts: Large Reasoning Models Are Not Private Thinkers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15674)
*Tommaso Green, Martin Gubri, Haritz Puerto, Sangdoo Yun, Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Privacy leakage in reasoning traces of large models is significant, as they often contain sensitive data, exacerbated by test-time compute approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that reasoning traces are safe and internal, revealing their vulnerability to privacy leaks.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations to assess leakage in reasoning traces, focusing on test-time compute approaches.

Result: Increased reasoning steps amplify privacy leakage, despite making models more cautious in final answers.

Conclusion: Safety efforts must address internal reasoning traces, not just outputs, due to the tension between utility and privacy.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

### [52] [Gender-Neutral Machine Translation Strategies in Practice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15676)
*Hillary Dawkins, Isar Nejadgholi, Chi-kiu Lo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 21 MT systems for their ability to maintain gender neutrality in translations, finding most fail but a few use specific strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving gender ambiguity in translations, especially in grammatical gender languages, to avoid misgendering.

Method: Assessed 21 MT systems across three translation directions, categorizing observed gender-neutral strategies.

Result: Most systems lacked gender-neutral translations, but a few employed specific strategies depending on the target language.

Conclusion: Despite limited success, some MT systems demonstrate potential for gender-inclusive translation, highlighting the need for further development.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

### [53] [GenRecal: Generation after Recalibration from Large to Small Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15681)
*Byung-Kwan Lee, Ryo Hachiuma, Yong Man Ro, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GenRecal is a distillation framework for VLMs that addresses architectural diversity, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from large to smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large VLMs on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to computational demands, necessitating efficient distillation methods.

Method: GenRecal uses a Recalibrator to align feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, facilitating cross-architecture knowledge transfer.

Result: GenRecal outperforms baseline and large-scale VLMs on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal provides a general-purpose solution for efficient VLM deployment, overcoming architectural limitations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

### [54] [PhantomHunter: Detecting Unseen Privately-Tuned LLM-Generated Text via Family-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15683)
*Yuhui Shi, Yehan Yang, Qiang Sheng, Hao Mi, Beizhe Hu, Chaoxi Xu, Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhantomHunter is a detector for LLM-generated text from privately-tuned models, outperforming existing methods with 96% F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of privately-tuned LLMs exacerbates misinformation and academic misconduct, challenging current detection methods.

Method: PhantomHunter uses a family-aware learning framework to detect shared traits across base models and their derivatives.

Result: Achieves over 96% F1 scores on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families, surpassing 7 baselines and 3 industrial services.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter effectively addresses the gap in detecting text from privately-tuned LLMs, offering superior performance.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

### [55] [HiURE: Hierarchical Exemplar Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02225)
*Shuliang Liu, Xuming Hu, Chenwei Zhang, Shu`ang Li, Lijie Wen, Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiURE is a novel contrastive learning framework for unsupervised relation extraction, addressing issues like gradual drift and semantic similarity disruption in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unsupervised relation extraction suffer from gradual drift problems or disrupt semantically similar sentence pairs.

Method: HiURE uses cross-hierarchy attention and exemplar-wise contrastive learning to derive hierarchical signals and optimize relation representations.

Result: HiURE outperforms state-of-the-art models on two public datasets, showing advanced effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: HiURE provides a robust solution for unsupervised relation extraction by leveraging hierarchical contrastive learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised relation extraction aims to extract the relationship between
entities from natural language sentences without prior information on
relational scope or distribution. Existing works either utilize self-supervised
schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive
clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt
instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those
sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we
propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the
capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using
cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of
sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on two
public datasets demonstrate the advanced effectiveness and robustness of HiURE
on unsupervised relation extraction when compared with state-of-the-art models.

*Xuemei Tang, Jun Wang, Qi Su, Chu-ren Huang, Jinghang Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage curriculum learning (TCL) framework is proposed to improve sequence labeling by gradually introducing data from easy to hard, enhancing performance and training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: External knowledge in sequence labeling introduces data heterogeneity and complexity, increasing training costs.

Method: TCL framework with gradual data introduction and difficulty metrics for sequence labeling tasks.

Result: Effective performance improvement on Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging datasets, with faster training.

Conclusion: TCL enhances model performance and training efficiency, addressing slow training in complex models.

Abstract: Sequence labeling models often benefit from incorporating external knowledge.
However, this practice introduces data heterogeneity and complicates the model
with additional modules, leading to increased expenses for training a
high-performing model. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
curriculum learning (TCL) framework specifically designed for sequence labeling
tasks. The TCL framework enhances training by gradually introducing data
instances from easy to hard, aiming to improve both performance and training
speed. Furthermore, we explore different metrics for assessing the difficulty
levels of sequence labeling tasks. Through extensive experimentation on six
Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and Part-of-speech tagging (POS) datasets, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in enhancing the performance of
sequence labeling models. Additionally, our analysis indicates that TCL
accelerates training and alleviates the slow training problem associated with
complex models.

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating synthetic data improves LLMs' ability to translate and understand math problems in Lean 4, addressing data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with math theorem proving in formal languages like Lean due to limited training data.

Method: Proposes an iterative pipeline to generate and filter synthetic data for translating between natural language and Lean 4.

Result: The pipeline yields 57K formal-informal question pairs and improves LLM performance in math problem translation.

Conclusion: The synthetic data pipeline effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances LLM capabilities in formal math tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing tasks, especially in solving mathematical
problems. However, large language models are not good at math theorem proving
using formal languages like Lean. A significant challenge in this area is the
scarcity of training data available in these formal languages. To address this
issue, we propose a novel pipeline that iteratively generates and filters
synthetic data to translate natural language mathematical problems into Lean 4
statements, and vice versa. Our results indicate that the synthetic data
pipeline can provide useful training data and improve the performance of LLMs
in translating and understanding complex mathematical problems and proofs. Our
final dataset contains about 57K formal-informal question pairs along with
searched proof from the math contest forum and 21 new IMO questions. We
open-source our code at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and our data

TL;DR: A framework for systematic monolingual NLP surveys is introduced to address biases and gaps in existing surveys, demonstrated through a case study on Greek NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monolingual NLP surveys lack standardized methodologies, leading to selection bias and fragmented coverage of tasks and resources.

Method: The framework includes a structured search protocol, NLP task taxonomy, and language resource taxonomies to classify and identify benchmarks.

Result: Applied to Greek NLP (2012-2023), the framework provides an in-depth analysis of its state, progress, and resource gaps, with publicly available results.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for Greek NLP and has potential for broader application to other less-resourced languages in NLP.

Abstract: Comprehensive monolingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) surveys are
essential for assessing language-specific challenges, resource availability,
and research gaps. However, existing surveys often lack standardized
methodologies, leading to selection bias and fragmented coverage of NLP tasks
and resources. This study introduces a generalizable framework for systematic
monolingual NLP surveys. Our approach integrates a structured search protocol
to minimize bias, an NLP task taxonomy for classification, and language
resource taxonomies to identify potential benchmarks and highlight
opportunities for improving resource availability. We apply this framework to
Greek NLP (2012-2023), providing an in-depth analysis of its current state,
task-specific progress, and resource gaps. The survey results are publicly
available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15314882) and are regularly updated
to provide an evergreen resource. This systematic survey of Greek NLP serves as
a case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and its
potential for broader application to other not so well-resourced languages as
regards NLP.

*Tianyu Yang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for anonymizing text against LLM-based re-identification, balancing privacy and data utility, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of anonymizing sensitive text while preserving utility, especially against advanced LLM re-identification.

Method: Proposes a framework with three LLM-based components: privacy evaluator, utility evaluator, and optimization module.

Result: Outperforms baselines, reducing re-identification risk while maintaining data utility.

Conclusion: The framework is robust and scalable, with potential for lightweight model distillation.

Abstract: Anonymizing text that contains sensitive information is crucial for a wide
range of applications. Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of the
re-identification ability of large language models (LLMs), which have shown
advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and reasoning over
dispersed pieces of patterns to draw conclusions. When defending against
LLM-based re-identification, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the
resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks. In general, the interaction
between anonymization and data utility requires a deeper understanding within
the context of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework composed of three
key LLM-based components: a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an
optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing
baselines, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while
preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks. We provide detailed
studies on these core modules. To consider large-scale and real-time
applications, we investigate the distillation of the anonymization capabilities
into lightweight models. All of our code and datasets will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2025-rupta.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadioRAG, a real-time retrieval-augmented framework, improves LLM accuracy in radiology by integrating authoritative online sources, outperforming non-RAG models and matching human radiologists in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLM limitations of outdated or inaccurate information by dynamically retrieving real-time domain-specific data.

Method: Developed RadioRAG to retrieve real-time data from Radiopaedia, evaluated diagnostic accuracy of LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama3) with and without RadioRAG on 104 radiology questions.

Result: RadioRAG improved accuracy by up to 54%, matching or exceeding non-RAG models and human radiologists, especially in breast imaging and emergency radiology, though effectiveness varied by model.

Conclusion: RadioRAG enhances LLM accuracy in radiology by integrating real-time domain-specific data, demonstrating potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate outdated or inaccurate
information based on static training datasets. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG
systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have
developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data
from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the
diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions
with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80
questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24
additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs
(GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were
prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG
retrieved context-specific information from Radiopaedia in real-time. Accuracy
was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The
results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved
diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging
up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the
human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties,
particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of
improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1
saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement,
highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when
provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. RadioRAG
shows potential to improve LLM accuracy and factuality in radiology question
answering by integrating real-time domain-specific data.

*Xinyi Zeng, Yuying Shang, Jiawei Chen, Jingyuan Zhang, Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decoder-oriented defense mechanism for LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs by correcting queries step-by-step, enhancing security without sacrificing speed or helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for addressing harmful outputs in LLMs are limited by ineffective prefill-level judgments and single-evaluation rejections, which reduce robustness and model helpfulness.

Method: A novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture is introduced, using speculative decoding to correct harmful queries directly and improve secure decoding speed.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method enhances model security while maintaining reasoning speed and helpfulness.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages LLMs' ability to recognize hazardous information, offering a robust defense without compromising utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various
industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due
to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods
effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging
harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's
decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2)
Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can
significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs'
capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their
proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot
experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level.
Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful
queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative
decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure
decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method
leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its
helpfulness compared to existing methods.

*Valentin Knappich, Simon Razniewski, Anna Hätty, Annemarie Friedrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAP2PAT is a benchmark for patent drafting using 1.8k patent-paper pairs. LLMs struggle with detail but improve with fine-tuning, though hallucination increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent drafting is time-intensive, and LLMs' potential in this area is understudied due to confidentiality of invention reports (IRs).

Method: Chunk-based outline-guided generation using research papers as IRs, evaluated on PAP2PAT and human case studies.

Result: LLMs can leverage paper information but lack detail. Fine-tuning improves patent-style language but increases hallucination.

Conclusion: PAP2PAT provides a realistic benchmark, highlighting LLMs' potential and limitations in patent drafting.

Abstract: Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in
supporting expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within
patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average.
Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent
applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which
are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting.
Often, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to
build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting
of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the
complex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based
outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification.
Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs
can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to
provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style
language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code

### [63] [Math Neurosurgery: Isolating Language Models' Math Reasoning Abilities Using Only Forward Passes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16930)
*Bryan R. Christ, Zack Gottesman, Jonathan Kropko, Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathNeuro is a method to isolate and manipulate math-specific parameters in LLMs, improving math performance without affecting general language abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how math reasoning is encoded in LLMs and enable targeted improvements in math performance without altering non-math behavior.

Method: Uses weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, filtering out those for general language tasks, and prunes or scales math-specific parameters.

Result: Improves math performance by 4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH, with minimal impact on general language abilities.

Conclusion: MathNeuro demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and intervening on math-specific parameters in LLMs, opening avenues for future research.

Abstract: Math reasoning is an active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research
because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence and has implications in
several domains, including math education. However, few works have explored how
math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can
be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to
improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster
understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math
Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate
math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on
existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter
importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those
important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro
identifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly
impacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a
small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by
4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered.
MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when
identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro
highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific
parameters.

### [64] [Interchangeable Token Embeddings for Extendable Vocabulary and Alpha-Equivalence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17161)
*İlker Işık, Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis, Ebru Aydin Gol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of language models in handling interchangeable tokens (e.g., bound variables in logic) and introduces alpha-covariance to evaluate robustness. A dual-part token embedding strategy improves generalization and inductive bias for alpha-equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle with interchangeable tokens, hindering generalization and recognition of alpha-equivalence. This limits their reasoning in formal domains.

Method: A dual-part token embedding strategy is proposed: a shared component for semantic consistency and a randomized component for token distinguishability.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline methods in tasks like logic solving and vocabulary extension, demonstrating better generalization and inductive bias.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for language models to learn interchangeable token representations, advancing systematic reasoning in formal domains.

Abstract: Language models lack the notion of interchangeable tokens: symbols that are
semantically equivalent yet distinct, such as bound variables in formal logic.
This limitation prevents generalization to larger vocabularies and hinders the
model's ability to recognize alpha-equivalence, where renaming bound variables
preserves meaning. We formalize this machine learning problem and introduce
alpha-covariance, a metric for evaluating robustness to such transformations.
To tackle this task, we propose a dual-part token embedding strategy: a shared
component ensures semantic consistency, while a randomized component maintains
token distinguishability. Compared to a baseline that relies on alpha-renaming
for data augmentation, our approach demonstrates improved generalization to
unseen tokens in linear temporal logic solving, propositional logic assignment
prediction, and copying with an extendable vocabulary, while introducing a
favorable inductive bias for alpha-equivalence. Our findings establish a
foundation for designing language models that can learn interchangeable token
representations, a crucial step toward more flexible and systematic reasoning
in formal domains. Our code and project page are available at

*Jan Pfister, Julia Wunderle, Andreas Hotho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two German-only decoder models, LL"aMmlein 120M and 1B, were created from scratch, with training data and models published for the German NLP community. The models performed competitively on benchmarks, showing scalable quality but plateauing in some tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide transparent, German-only decoder models and training data for the German NLP research community.

Method: Extensive data preprocessing, custom German tokenizer creation, model training, and evaluation using benchmarks like SuperGLEBer.

Result: Both models matched or surpassed similar-sized models on benchmarks, with quality scaling by size but plateauing in some tasks.

Conclusion: The models offer valuable insights for future resource allocation in German NLP model development.

Abstract: We create two German-only decoder models, LL\"aMmlein 120M and 1B,
transparently from scratch and publish them, along with the training data, for
the German NLP research community to use. The model training involved several
key steps, including extensive data preprocessing, the creation of a custom
German tokenizer, the training itself, as well as the evaluation of the final
models on various benchmarks. Throughout the training process, multiple
checkpoints were saved and analyzed using the SuperGLEBer benchmark to monitor
the models' learning dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art models on the
SuperGLEBer benchmark, both LL\"aMmlein models performed competitively,
consistently matching or surpassing models with similar parameter sizes. The
results show that the models' quality scales with size as expected, but
performance improvements on some tasks plateaued early, offering valuable
insights into resource allocation for future model development.

### [66] [REVOLVE: Optimizing AI Systems by Tracking Response Evolution in Textual Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03092)
*Peiyan Zhang, Haibo Jin, Leyang Hu, Xinnuo Li, Liying Kang, Man Luo, Yangqiu Song, Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REVOLVE is an adaptive optimization method for LLM systems that tracks response evolution over iterations, outperforming baselines in prompt, solution, and code optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing LLM-based systems for specific tasks is challenging due to reliance on manual interventions and limitations of immediate feedback methods.

Method: REVOLVE tracks how responses evolve across iterations, enabling stable and effective optimization through progressive adjustments.

Result: REVOLVE achieves 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, 20.72% in solution refinement, and 29.17% in code optimization, with faster convergence.

Conclusion: REVOLVE demonstrates the potential of leveraging optimization principles to enhance LLM systems, paving the way for hybrid advancements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through
natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these
LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring
manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based
techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to
using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However,
relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in
response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly,
potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome
these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations
where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper,
we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how "R"esponses
"EVOLVE" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of
responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by
making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results
demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8%
improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a
29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer
iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. Beyond its
practical contributions, REVOLVE highlights a promising direction, where the
rich knowledge from established optimization principles can be leveraged to
enhance LLM systems, which paves the way for further advancements in this
hybrid domain.

*Xuemei Tang, Xufeng Duan, Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to automate literature reviews, introducing a framework to assess reference generation, summarization, and composition. Findings show hallucinated references and varying performance across disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and comprehensiveness of LLMs in automating literature reviews, given their potential but unclear effectiveness.

Method: A framework with multidimensional metrics evaluates hallucination rates, semantic coverage, and factual consistency in LLM outputs compared to human-written reviews.

Result: Advanced LLMs still produce hallucinated references, and performance varies by discipline, indicating reliability issues.

Conclusion: Further research is needed to enhance LLMs' reliability for automating academic literature reviews.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to automate
the complex processes involved in writing literature reviews, such as
literature collection, organization, and summarization. However, it is yet
unclear how good LLMs are at automating comprehensive and reliable literature
reviews. This study introduces a framework to automatically evaluate the
performance of LLMs in three key tasks of literature writing: reference
generation, literature summary, and literature review composition. We introduce
multidimensional evaluation metrics that assess the hallucination rates in
generated references and measure the semantic coverage and factual consistency
of the literature summaries and compositions against human-written
counterparts. The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced
models still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress.
Moreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across
disciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews. These findings
highlight the need for further research and development to improve the
reliability of LLMs in automating academic literature reviews.

*Yidong Gan, Maciej Rybinski, Ben Hachey, Jonathan K. Kummerfeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation methods in automated clinical coding research, proposing eight recommendations and alternative AI-based methods to better align with real-world clinical needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual clinical coding is labor-intensive and error-prone, but current automated coding research lacks alignment with practical clinical contexts, such as oversimplified evaluations focusing on common codes.

Method: Analysis of US English electronic health records and automated coding research, leading to eight recommendations for improved evaluation methods and proposing new AI-based approaches.

Result: Current evaluation methods are misaligned with real clinical coding challenges, and alternative AI methods could better assist coders.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for aligning AI coding research with practical clinical needs and suggests improvements to evaluation methods and workflows.

Abstract: Clinical coding is crucial for healthcare billing and data analysis. Manual
clinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated
research towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based
on US English electronic health records and automated coding research using
these records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with
real clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most
common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in
practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely
with practical challenges of clinical coding. Based on our analysis, we offer
eight specific recommendations, suggesting ways to improve current evaluation
methods. Additionally, we propose new AI-based methods beyond automated coding,
suggesting alternative approaches to assist clinical coders in their workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM-generated questions differ from human-authored ones in quality and characteristics.

Method: Evaluated questions from four state-of-the-art LLMs across six dimensions: type, length, context coverage, answerability, uncommonness, and answer length.

Result: LLM-generated questions require longer answers and show more balanced context focus, unlike human questions with positional bias.

Conclusion: LLM-generated questions have unique traits, offering insights for improving question quality and applications.

Abstract: We evaluate questions generated by large language models (LLMs) from context,
comparing them to human-authored questions across six dimensions: question
type, question length, context coverage, answerability, uncommonness, and
required answer length. Our study spans two open-source and two proprietary
state-of-the-art models. Results reveal that LLM-generated questions tend to
demand longer descriptive answers and exhibit more evenly distributed context
focus, in contrast to the positional bias often seen in QA tasks. These
findings provide insights into the distinctive characteristics of LLM-generated
questions and inform future work on question quality and downstream
applications.

### [70] [Perspective Transition of Large Language Models for Solving Subjective Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09265)
*Xiaolong Wang, Yuanchi Zhang, Ziyue Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Fuwen Luo, Yile Wang, Peng Li, Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning through Perspective Transition (RPT), a method for LLMs to dynamically select perspectives (direct, role, or third-person) to improve performance on subjective tasks, outperforming fixed-perspective methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in objective tasks but struggle with subjective ones, where perspective matters. The paper aims to enhance LLMs' adaptability in perspective selection for nuanced responses.

Method: Proposes RPT, an in-context learning method for dynamic perspective selection (direct, role, third-person) in LLMs.

Result: RPT outperforms fixed-perspective methods (e.g., chain-of-thought, expert prompting) across 12 subjective tasks using models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama-3, and Qwen-2.

Conclusion: Dynamic perspective selection via RPT enables LLMs to provide more nuanced and contextually appropriate responses for subjective tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural
language processing, enabling remarkable progress in various tasks. Different
from objective tasks such as commonsense reasoning and arithmetic
question-answering, the performance of LLMs on subjective tasks is still
limited, where the perspective on the specific problem plays crucial roles for
better interpreting the context and giving proper response. For example, in
certain scenarios, LLMs may perform better when answering from an expert role
perspective, potentially eliciting their relevant domain knowledge. In
contrast, in some scenarios, LLMs may provide more accurate responses when
answering from a third-person standpoint, enabling a more comprehensive
understanding of the problem and potentially mitigating inherent biases. In
this paper, we propose Reasoning through Perspective Transition (RPT), a method
based on in-context learning that enables LLMs to dynamically select among
direct, role, and third-person perspectives for the best way to solve
corresponding subjective problem. Through extensive experiments on totally 12
subjective tasks by using both closed-source and open-source LLMs including
GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama-3, and Qwen-2, our method outperforms widely used single
fixed perspective based methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and expert
prompting, highlights the intricate ways that LLMs can adapt their perspectives
to provide nuanced and contextually appropriate responses for different
problems.

*Zujie Liang, Feng Wei, Wujiang Xu, Lin Chen, Yuxi Qian, Xinhui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS) to improve LLM-based agents' code generation diversity and quality, outperforming existing AutoML agents by 6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents face issues with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation, and current MCTS methods have limitations in thought quality and feedback mechanisms.

Method: The study proposes I-MCTS, which iteratively refines nodes by analyzing parent and sibling solutions, and integrates an LLM-based value model for node evaluation. A hybrid reward mechanism transitions from LLM-estimated to actual performance scores.

Result: Applied to ML tasks, I-MCTS achieves a 6% absolute performance improvement over open-source AutoML agents.

Conclusion: I-MCTS effectively enhances decision-making and performance in agentic AutoML systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable
potential in automating machine learning tasks. However, existing LLM-based
agents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While
recent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these
issues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated,
as well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In
this study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a
novel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective
process that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and
sibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the
search tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process.
Furthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to
facilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting
comprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is
implemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to
actual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed
earlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 6%
absolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML
agents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.

*Chenlong Wang, Zhaoyang Chu, Zhengxiang Cheng, Xuyi Yang, Kaiyue Qiu, Yao Wan, Zhou Zhao, Xuanhua Shi, Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for tracking code updates, and CODESYNCBENCH, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to adapt to evolving code knowledge. It highlights LLMs' struggles with dynamic updates despite advanced methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges adapting to evolving third-party library APIs due to static pre-training datasets, leading to outdated or unsafe code.

Method: Developed CODESYNC for real-time code updates and CODESYNCBENCH, a benchmark with 3,300 test cases and 2,200 training samples, tested on 14 LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with advanced updating methods like DPO, ORPO, and SimPO.

Conclusion: CODESYNCBENCH provides a foundation for developing better real-time code knowledge updating methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance in
software engineering yet face challenges in adapting to continually evolving
code knowledge, particularly regarding the frequent updates of third-party
library APIs. This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets,
often results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety
and efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for
identifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge
updates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop
CODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay
synchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs
from six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three
evaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of
2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of
advanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe
that our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more
effective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future. The

*Xiang Geng, Zhejian Lai, Jiajun Chen, Hao Yang, Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCSQE is a framework to reduce distribution shift in synthetic QE data by improving translation diversity and alignment with human preferences, outperforming SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing distribution shift in synthetic QE data, which arises from discrepancies between pseudo and real translations or misaligned pseudo labels.

Method: Uses constrained beam search and diverse generation models to align pseudo and real translations, and references to guide generation and annotation. Mimics human annotation for phrase-level labels.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines like CometKiwi in supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: DCSQE effectively mitigates distribution shift in synthetic QE data, offering insights for synthetic data generation in other tasks.

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) models evaluate the quality of machine translations
without reference translations, serving as the reward models for the
translation task. Due to the data scarcity, synthetic data generation has
emerged as a promising solution. However, synthetic QE data often suffers from
distribution shift, which can manifest as discrepancies between pseudo and real
translations, or in pseudo labels that do not align with human preferences. To
tackle this issue, we introduce DCSQE, a novel framework for alleviating
distribution shift in synthetic QE data. To reduce the difference between
pseudo and real translations, we employ the constrained beam search algorithm
and enhance translation diversity through the use of distinct generation
models. DCSQE uses references, i.e., translation supervision signals, to guide
both the generation and annotation processes, enhancing the quality of
token-level labels. DCSQE further identifies the shortest phrase covering
consecutive error tokens, mimicking human annotation behavior, to assign the
final phrase-level labels. Specially, we underscore that the translation model
can not annotate translations of itself accurately. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DCSQE outperforms SOTA baselines like CometKiwi in both
supervised and unsupervised settings. Further analysis offers insights into
synthetic data generation that could benefit reward models for other tasks. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsychBench, a benchmarking system to evaluate LLMs in psychiatric settings, revealing their potential but current inadequacy as decision-making tools, with notable benefits for junior psychiatrists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a robust framework to assess LLMs in psychiatric clinical environments, hindering specialized LLM development.

Method: Proposed PsychBench, evaluated 16 LLMs, analyzed prompt design, reasoning, text length, and fine-tuning, and conducted a clinical reader study with 60 psychiatrists.

Result: LLMs show potential but fall short as decision-making tools; they significantly aid junior psychiatrists in efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: PsychBench highlights LLMs' promise and limitations, advocating for further research and public release of the dataset and framework.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solutions to
address problems such as shortage of medical resources and low diagnostic
consistency in psychiatric clinical practice. Despite this potential, a robust
and comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in
authentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the
advancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In
response to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and
clinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the
practical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a
comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and
investigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input
text length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance.
Through detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential
limitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement.
Subsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying
seniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing
LLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the
quantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models
demonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making
tools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates
that, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for
junior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall
clinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset
and evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the
application of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings.

*José Pombal, Nuno M. Guerreiro, Ricardo Rei, André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses metric interference (MINT) in machine learning, where using the same or related metrics for tuning and evaluation leads to overoptimistic performance estimates. It introduces MINTADJUST, a method to improve evaluation reliability under MINT, showing superior results in machine translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of unintentionally gaming metrics during model development due to MINT, which distorts performance estimates and reduces correlation with human judgments.

Method: Analysis of MINT in machine translation tasks (training data filtering and decoding with quality signals) and introduction of MINTADJUST for reliable evaluation.

Result: MINTADJUST outperforms state-of-the-art metrics and AUTORANK in ranking translations and systems, especially for high-quality systems on the WMT24 MT test set.

Conclusion: MINTADJUST provides a more reliable evaluation method under MINT, addressing distortions in metric scores and improving performance estimation.

Abstract: As automatic metrics become increasingly stronger and widely adopted, the
risk of unintentionally "gaming the metric" during model development rises.
This issue is caused by metric interference (MINT), i.e., the use of the same
or related metrics for both model tuning and evaluation. MINT can misguide
practitioners into being overoptimistic about the performance of their systems:
as system outputs become a function of the interfering metric, their estimated
quality loses correlation with human judgments. In this work, we analyze two
common cases of MINT in machine translation-related tasks: filtering of
training data, and decoding with quality signals. Importantly, we find that
MINT strongly distorts instance-level metric scores, even when metrics are not
directly optimized for-questioning the common strategy of leveraging a
different, yet related metric for evaluation that is not used for tuning. To
address this problem, we propose MINTADJUST, a method for more reliable
evaluation under MINT. On the WMT24 MT shared task test set, MINTADJUST ranks
translations and systems more accurately than state-of-the-art metrics across a
majority of language pairs, especially for high-quality systems. Furthermore,
MINTADJUST outperforms AUTORANK, the ensembling method used by the organizers.

*Bhiman Kumar Baghel, Scott M. Jordan, Zheyuan Ryan Shi, Xiang Lorraine Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes iterative and neighbor-assisted model editing to improve LLM knowledge updates, reducing UnderEdit and OverEdit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating LLM knowledge via retraining is costly; model editing is efficient but suffers from UnderEdit and OverEdit.

Method: Introduces iterative model editing (for UnderEdit) and neighbor-assisted editing (for OverEdit).

Result: Reduces UnderEdit by up to 38% and OverEdit by up to 6%, applicable to any locate-and-edit method.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance editing performance across LLMs and benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in downstream tasks, but
keeping their knowledge up-to-date via retraining or fine-tuning is often
computationally expensive. Model editing provides a more efficient alternative
by updating a targeted subset of parameters, which often follows the
locate-and-edit paradigm. Despite this efficiency, existing methods are
limited: edits may fail to inject knowledge (UnderEdit) or unintentionally
disrupt unrelated neighboring knowledge (OverEdit). To address these
challenges, we propose two complementary methods: iterative model editing,
which applies successive edits to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted
model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to
reduce OverEdit. Our extensive experiments show that these techniques improve
editing performance across multiple LLMs, algorithms, and benchmarks, reducing
UnderEdit by up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit by up to 6, while
remaining broadly applicable to any locate-and-edit method.

tasks. Nevertheless, when general models are applied to some specific domains,
e.g., Classical Chinese texts, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory, and
fine-tuning open-source foundational models similarly struggles to adequately
incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, this study
developed a large language model, AI Taiyan, specifically designed for
understanding and generating Classical Chinese. Experiments show that with a
reasonable model design, data processing, foundational training, and
fine-tuning, satisfactory results can be achieved with only 1.8 billion
parameters. In key tasks related to language processing of Classical Chinese
such as punctuation, identification of allusions, explanation of word meanings,
and translation between ancient and modern Chinese, this model exhibits a clear
advantage over both general-purpose large models and domain-specific
traditional models, achieving levels close to or surpassing human baselines.
This research provides a reference for the efficient construction of
specialized domain-specific large language models. Furthermore, the paper
discusses the application of this model in fields such as the collation of
ancient texts, dictionary editing, and language research, combined with case
studies.

### [79] [J4R: Learning to Judge with Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13346)
*Austin Xu, Yilun Zhou, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes training LLM-as-judge models with reinforcement learning to improve their performance in reasoning-intensive domains, introducing a new algorithm, benchmark, and a trained judge model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-as-judge models struggle in reasoning-intensive domains, prompting the need for improved evaluation methods.

Method: The authors introduce the EIS-GRPO algorithm to train judges, create ReasoningJudgeBench for evaluation, and develop J4R, a 7B judge model.

Result: J4R outperforms GPT-4o and other small judges by 6.7% and 9%, matching or exceeding larger models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can effectively enhance LLM-as-judge models for complex reasoning tasks, as demonstrated by J4R's performance.

Abstract: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM)
development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming
human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with
assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class
of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains,
like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model
responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing
judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning
(RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial
State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us
to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex
evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that
evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3)
We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that
outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or
exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and
ReasoningJudgeBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GreekBarBench evaluates LLMs on Greek Bar exam legal questions using a three-dimensional scoring system and LLM-as-a-judge approach, showing top models outperform average experts but not the top 5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' performance on legal questions requiring citations and case facts, addressing free-text evaluation challenges.

Method: A three-dimensional scoring system with LLM-as-a-judge, plus a meta-evaluation benchmark to align LLM and human expert evaluations.

Result: Best models outperform average expert scores but don't reach the 95th percentile of experts.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in legal evaluations but still lag behind top human experts.

Abstract: We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal
questions across five different legal areas from the Greek Bar exams, requiring
citations to statutory articles and case facts. To tackle the challenges of
free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined
with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to
assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations,
revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our
systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even
though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the
95th percentile of experts.

### [81] [Efficient Long CoT Reasoning in Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18440)
*Zhaoyang Wang, Jinqi Jiang, Tian Qiu, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to prune redundant steps in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for small language models (SLMs) improves distillation efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly training SLMs for long CoT reasoning is challenging due to redundant content and limited capacity.

Method: Proposes pruning unnecessary CoT steps and using an on-policy method to curate training data for SLMs.

Result: SLMs achieve competitive performance with reduced redundant reasoning steps.

Conclusion: The method effectively distills long CoT reasoning into SLMs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex
problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to
emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs
for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of
redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn
considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this
issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in
long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate
valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively
learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the
same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling
long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive
performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

*Hao Chen, Haoze Li, Zhiqing Xiao, Lirong Gao, Qi Zhang, Xiaomeng Hu, Ningtao Wang, Xing Fu, Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALPS is a method to efficiently align LLMs by localizing and pruning task-sensitive attention heads, reducing training costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and data dependency in aligning LLMs to downstream tasks, aiming for better generalization and reusability.

Method: Proposes ALPS, which localizes and prunes task-sensitive attention heads, restricting updates to these heads.

Result: Activates only 10% of attention parameters, achieving 2% performance improvement; task-specific heads are transferable and reduce knowledge forgetting.

Conclusion: ALPS offers a novel, efficient approach to LLM alignment, with practical benefits and transferability.

Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks
often incurs significant training adjustment costs. Prior research has explored
various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data
training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However,
these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders
generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model
alignment efficiency, we propose the Attention Localization and Pruning
Strategy (ALPS), an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive
attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these
heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method activates only 10% of attention parameters during fine-tuning while
achieving a 2% performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover,
the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and
mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel
perspective on efficient LLM alignment. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Avengers, a method combining smaller open-source models to outperform proprietary giants like GPT-4 variants across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that smaller, open-source models can compete with larger proprietary models by leveraging collective intelligence.

Method: The Avengers uses four steps: embedding, clustering, scoring, and voting to combine the strengths of smaller models.

Result: With 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers outperforms GPT-4 variants on 15 diverse datasets, notably in mathematics and coding tasks.

Conclusion: The Avengers proves smaller models can be competitive through strategic collaboration, offering robust and generalized performance.

Abstract: Proprietary giants are increasingly dominating the race for ever-larger
language models. Can open-source, smaller models remain competitive across a
broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers -- a simple recipe
that leverages the collective intelligence of these smaller models. The
Avengers builds upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries
using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their
semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each
cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At
inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The
top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the
response with repeated sampling. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B
parameters each), the Avengers surpasses GPT-4o, 4.1, and 4.5 in average
performance across 15 diverse datasets spanning mathematics, coding, logical
reasoning, general knowledge, and affective tasks. In particular, it surpasses
GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore,
the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains
robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble
strategies, and values of its sole parameter -- the number of clusters.

*Valentin Knappich, Annemarie Friedrich, Anna Hätty, Simon Razniewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEDANTIC, a dataset of 14k US patent claims annotated for indefiniteness, using an automated pipeline with LLMs for extraction and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of annotated datasets for patent definiteness examination, aiming to improve efficiency in patent drafting and examination.

Method: Constructs PEDANTIC using an automated pipeline that retrieves office action documents and employs LLMs for annotation, validated by human study.

Result: LLMs like Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B underperform logistic regression in definiteness prediction but correctly identify reasons.

Conclusion: PEDANTIC is a valuable resource for patent AI research, with plans for public release of the dataset and code.

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are
ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is
referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most
frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic
methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent
drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been
published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination
Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications
relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for
indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that
retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study
confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To
gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge
evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason
with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B
and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness
prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons.
PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the
development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the
dataset and code.

*John X. Morris, Chawin Sitawarin, Chuan Guo, Narine Kokhlikyan, G. Edward Suh, Alexander M. Rush, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to measure model capacity by distinguishing memorization from generalization, estimating GPT-style models at 3.6 bits per parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle memorization from generalization in language models and quantify model capacity.

Method: Formally separates memorization into unintended memorization and generalization, measures capacity by eliminating generalization, and trains models of varying sizes.

Result: Estimates GPT-style models' capacity at 3.6 bits per parameter; memorization decreases as models generalize ('grokking').

Conclusion: Provides scaling laws for model capacity and data size, showing memorization fills capacity before generalization begins.

Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model knows about a
datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior
studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle
memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two
components: unintended memorization, the information a model contains about a
specific dataset, and generalization, the information a model contains about
the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate generalization,
we can compute the total memorization, which provides an estimate of model
capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models have a capacity of
approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language models on datasets of
increasing size and observe that models memorize until their capacity fills, at
which point "grokking" begins, and unintended memorization decreases as models
begin to generalize. We train hundreds of transformer language models ranging
from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and produce a series of scaling laws relating
model capacity and data size to membership inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HC-Bench reveals VLMs fail at detecting hidden content in images, achieving near-zero accuracy. SemVink, a simple scaling method, boosts accuracy to >99%, exposing VLMs' architectural flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address VLMs' inability to detect hidden content in images, a core human capability, and propose improvements.

Method: Introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden content, and SemVink, a method scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels).

Result: VLMs achieve 0-5.36% accuracy on HC-Bench, while SemVink achieves >99%.

Conclusion: VLMs' overreliance on high-level semantics limits their robustness. Hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing are needed.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core
human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated
images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a
benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing
that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit
prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to
an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink
(Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128
pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise.
This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning
over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work
urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging
the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in
medical imaging, security, and beyond.

*Ho Yin 'Sam' Ng, Ting-Yao Hsu, Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan, Branislav Kveton, Nedim Lipka, Franck Dernoncourt, Dongwon Lee, Tong Yu, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A. Rossi, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap introduces a multimodal dataset for personalized figure caption generation, improving caption quality by leveraging contextual figure profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caption generation models lack personalization and multimodal context, requiring authors to revise generic outputs.

Method: LaMP-Cap provides multimodal figure profiles (images, captions, and paragraphs) alongside target figures to train LLMs for personalized caption generation.

Result: Experiments show that using profile information, especially images, improves caption alignment with author-written ones.

Conclusion: Multimodal profiles outperform text-only ones, enhancing personalized caption generation.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

*Jesse Woo, Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori, Ana Marasović, Kenneth Marino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIEFME, a dataset for evaluating language models in legal brief tasks like summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval, showing strengths in summarization but weaknesses in realistic argument completion and case retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored area of legal brief writing in Legal NLP by evaluating language models' ability to assist with legal tasks.

Method: Created BRIEFME dataset with three tasks: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval, then analyzed performance of current models.

Result: LLMs excel in summarization and guided completion but struggle with realistic argument completion and case retrieval.

Conclusion: BRIEFME aims to spur further Legal NLP development to better assist legal professionals.

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

TL;DR: BIS Reasoning 1.0 is a Japanese dataset for evaluating belief-inconsistent reasoning in LLMs, revealing biases in models like GPT-4o (79.54% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover reasoning biases in LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting syllogisms, especially for high-stakes domains.

Method: Benchmarking state-of-the-art models (GPT, Claude, Japanese LLMs) on belief-inconsistent syllogisms.

Result: GPT-4o achieved 79.54% accuracy, but LLMs struggle with belief-conflicting inputs.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in handling belief-inconsistent reasoning for reliable use in critical domains.

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

TL;DR: NoWait, a method disabling explicit self-reflection tokens like 'Wait' and 'Hmm', reduces reasoning trajectory length by 27%-51% without losing utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overthinking and redundancy in large reasoning models by questioning the necessity of explicit self-reflection.

Method: Propose NoWait, which suppresses self-reflection tokens during inference.

Result: Reduces reasoning trajectory length significantly (27%-51%) across ten benchmarks without compromising utility.

Conclusion: NoWait provides an efficient, plug-and-play solution for multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: Router-R1 is an RL-based framework for multi-LLM routing, dynamically invoking models and balancing performance-cost trade-offs, outperforming baselines on QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routers lack the ability to handle complex tasks requiring multiple models' complementary strengths, prompting the need for a dynamic, sequential decision-making approach.

Method: Router-R1 uses reinforcement learning, interleaving 'think' and 'route' actions, and integrates responses into evolving context. It employs rule-based rewards for format, outcome, and cost optimization.

Result: Router-R1 outperforms baselines on seven QA benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance, generalization, and cost management.

Conclusion: Router-R1 effectively addresses the limitations of single-round routing, offering a scalable solution for multi-LLM tasks with robust performance-cost trade-offs.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight
rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel
cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a
pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also
conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and
example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Unified RoPE, a method to integrate Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) by unifying their positional encoding mechanisms, resulting in the TransXSSM hybrid model with improved speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of integrating Transformers and SSMs due to incompatible positional encoding mechanisms (explicit RoPE in Transformers vs. implicit convolutions in SSMs) leads to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduces Unified RoPE, a consistent positional encoding framework, and TransXSSM, a hybrid architecture combining Transformer and SSM layers under this unified scheme.

Result: TransXSSM is 42.3% faster in training and 29.5% faster in inference at sequence length 4K, with over 4% higher accuracy on language modeling benchmarks. It also scales better, with a 7.22% accuracy gain for the 1.3B model over the 320M version.

Conclusion: Unified positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient and high-performance long-context modeling.

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongr inuity their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance.To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (Unified RoPE)
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this Unified RoPE, we
introduce TransXSSM, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4 sequenceK length, TransXSSM exhibits training and inference speeds that are
42.3% and 29.5% faster, respectively, relative to standard Transformer models.
It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable settings, it surpasses a
Transformer baseline by over 4% on language modeling benchmarks.TransXSSM
furthermore scales more effectively: TransXSSM-1.3B gains 7.22% in average
accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6% gains for equivalent
Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified positional encoding
resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient,
high-performance long-context modeling.

TL;DR: DMAO is a framework for architecture optimization that uses a grow-and-drop strategy to reallocate parameters efficiently during training, improving performance with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for architecture design are either expertise-heavy (handcrafted rules) or computationally expensive (automated methods like neural architecture search). DMAO aims to address these limitations.

Method: DMAO employs a grow-and-drop strategy to dynamically reallocate parameters from underutilized areas to more beneficial parts of the model during training.

Result: Experiments on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2, and Switchboard datasets show DMAO improves WER by up to 6% with the same training resources.

Conclusion: DMAO offers an efficient and effective solution for architecture optimization, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Architecture design is inherently complex. Existing approaches rely on either
handcrafted rules, which demand extensive empirical expertise, or automated
methods like neural architecture search, which are computationally intensive.
In this paper, we introduce DMAO, an architecture optimization framework that
employs a grow-and-drop strategy to automatically reallocate parameters during
training. This reallocation shifts resources from less-utilized areas to those
parts of the model where they are most beneficial. Notably, DMAO only
introduces negligible training overhead at a given model complexity. We
evaluate DMAO through experiments with CTC on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2 and
Switchboard datasets. The results show that, using the same amount of training
resources, our proposed DMAO consistently improves WER by up to 6% relatively
across various architectures, model sizes, and datasets. Furthermore, we
analyze the pattern of parameter redistribution and uncover insightful
findings.

Motivation: Previous research focused on optimizing goal-oriented paths but ignored inconsistencies between responses and dialogue contexts.

Method: A model-agnostic CRC framework with two stages: reflection (identifying inconsistencies) and correction (generating consistent responses).

Result: Experiments on various models (BART, T5, GPT-2, etc.) show CRC significantly improves response consistency across three datasets.

Conclusion: The CRC framework effectively enhances the alignment of generated responses with dialogue contexts.

Abstract: Goal-oriented proactive dialogue systems are designed to guide user
conversations seamlessly towards specific objectives by planning a
goal-oriented path. However, previous research has focused predominantly on
optimizing these paths while neglecting the inconsistencies that may arise
between generated responses and dialogue contexts, including user profiles,
dialogue history, domain knowledge, and subgoals. To address this issue, we
introduce a model-agnostic two-stage Consistency Reflection and Correction
(CRC) framework. Specifically, in the consistency reflection stage, the model
is prompted to reflect on the discrepancies between generated responses and
dialogue contexts, identifying inconsistencies and suggesting possible
corrections. In the consistency correction stage, the model generates responses
that are more consistent with the dialogue context based on these reflection
results. We conducted experiments on various model architectures with different
parameter sizes, including encoder-decoder models (BART, T5) and decoder-only
models (GPT-2, DialoGPT, Phi3, Mistral and LLaMA3), and the experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our CRC framework significantly
improves the consistency between generated responses and dialogue contexts.

### [95] [GRAM: A Generative Foundation Reward Model for Reward Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14175)
*Chenglong Wang, Yang Gan, Yifu Huo, Yongyu Mu, Qiaozhi He, Murun Yang, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, Chunliang Zhang, Tongran Liu, Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative reward model for LLMs, trained with unsupervised and supervised learning, linking generative and discriminative models. It generalizes well across tasks like ranking, RLHF, and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models for LLMs rely solely on labeled human preference data. The paper explores using both unlabeled and labeled data to improve reward model training.

Method: Develops a generative reward model trained via unsupervised learning and fine-tuned with supervised learning, using label smoothing for regularization.

Result: The model generalizes well across tasks (ranking, RLHF, adaptation), outperforming baselines with little or no fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The generative reward model bridges generative and discriminative approaches, offering a versatile foundation for diverse tasks.

Abstract: In aligning large language models (LLMs), reward models have played an
important role, but are standardly trained as discriminative models and rely
only on labeled human preference data. In this paper, we explore methods that
train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the
generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first
trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via
supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact
optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides
a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and
discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome
of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive
experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks,
including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and
task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance
improvements over several strong baseline models.

*Yeonkyoung So, Gyuseong Lee, Sungmok Jung, Joonhak Lee, JiA Kang, Sangho Kim, Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-NUBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' understanding of sentence-level negation, focusing on diverse negation types beyond surface cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately address negation, treating it as a side case, leading to gaps in evaluating LLMs' deep semantic understanding of negation.

Method: The benchmark includes manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset to assess models' negation comprehension.

Result: Thunder-NUBench provides a specialized tool for evaluating LLMs' performance on diverse negation types, such as local negation and contradiction.

Conclusion: The benchmark fills a gap in negation-focused evaluation, enabling deeper insights into LLMs' semantic understanding of negation.

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that poses persistent
challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring
deep semantic understanding. Existing benchmarks often treat negation as a side
case within broader tasks like natural language inference, resulting in a lack
of benchmarks that exclusively target negation understanding. In this work, we
introduce Thunder-NUBench, a novel benchmark explicitly designed to assess
sentence-level negation understanding in LLMs. Thunder-NUBench goes beyond
surface-level cue detection by contrasting standard negation with structurally
diverse alternatives such as local negation, contradiction, and paraphrase. The
benchmark consists of manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a
multiple-choice dataset that enables in-depth evaluation of models' negation
understanding.

*Chenchen Yuan, Zheyu Zhang, Shuo Yang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collective consensus, improving alignment and consistency in moral reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies in LLMs' moral reasoning when faced with complex dilemmas.

Method: Aggregates moral acceptability scores into a collective probability, weights contributions by model reliability, and fine-tunes misaligned models via embedding optimization.

Result: Improves consensus robustness and individual model fidelity on social moral dilemmas.

Conclusion: Data-driven moral alignment across multiple models enhances AI safety and consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive moral reasoning abilities.
Yet they often diverge when confronted with complex, multi-factor moral
dilemmas. To address these discrepancies, we propose a framework that
synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collectively formulated moral
judgment, realigning models that deviate significantly from this consensus. Our
aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond
binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model
reliability. For misaligned models, a targeted embedding-optimization procedure
fine-tunes token embeddings for moral philosophical theories, minimizing JS
divergence to the consensus while preserving semantic integrity. Experiments on
a large-scale social moral dilemma dataset show our approach builds robust
consensus and improves individual model fidelity. These findings highlight the
value of data-driven moral alignment across multiple models and its potential
for safer, more consistent AI systems.

*Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Bernd Weiß, Jessica Daikeler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of LLMs for coding open-ended survey responses in German, comparing performance across models and prompting approaches, and highlights trade-offs in automated classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can efficiently replace manual coding or supervised models for open-ended survey responses, especially in non-English contexts and complex topics.

Method: Comparison of several state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting approaches using German survey data, evaluated against human expert codings.

Result: Performance varies greatly between LLMs; only fine-tuned models achieve satisfactory accuracy. Prompting effectiveness depends on the LLM, and unequal classification affects categorical distributions.

Conclusion: LLMs offer potential but require careful consideration of trade-offs for accurate and reliable use in survey research, particularly for non-English or complex data.

Abstract: The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred
discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including
classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it
is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual
coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most
existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses
relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its
findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to
established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different
LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using
German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare
several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate
the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance
differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory
levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting
approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal
classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey
participation results in different categorical distributions when not using
fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for
methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their
substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively
analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need
to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response
classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the
growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be
efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ring-lite is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model optimized via RL, matching SOTA small-scale reasoning models' performance while using fewer parameters. It introduces C3PO for stable RL training, entropy-based checkpoint selection, and a two-stage training paradigm for multi-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve efficient and robust reasoning capabilities in large language models while minimizing computational costs.

Method: Joint training pipeline integrating distillation with RL, introducing C3PO for stability, entropy-based checkpoint selection, and a two-stage training paradigm.

Result: Matches SOTA performance on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench) with one-third the parameters of comparable models.

Conclusion: Ring-lite demonstrates efficient reasoning with reduced computational overhead, addressing challenges in MoE RL training and multi-domain data integration.

Abstract: We present Ring-lite, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language model
optimized via reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and robust
reasoning capabilities. Built upon the publicly available Ling-lite model, a
16.8 billion parameter model with 2.75 billion activated parameters, our
approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-scale
reasoning models on challenging benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench,
GPQA-Diamond) while activating only one-third of the parameters required by
comparable models. To accomplish this, we introduce a joint training pipeline
integrating distillation with RL, revealing undocumented challenges in MoE RL
training. First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and
we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a
novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational
throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology. Second, we empirically
demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for
RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior
performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training. Finally, we
develop a two-stage training paradigm to harmonize multi-domain data
integration, addressing domain conflicts that arise in training with mixed
dataset. We will release the model, dataset, and code.

dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of

challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers

TL;DR: ViLLa is a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable animal monitoring, combining visual detection, language parsing, and symbolic reasoning to answer natural language queries about animal presence, count, and location.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent and modular system for monitoring animal populations by interpreting visual data and human language queries, addressing the limitations of black-box models.

Method: Integrates three components: visual detection for animal identification, a language parser for query understanding, and a symbolic reasoning layer for logic-based inference.

Result: Demonstrates the ability to accurately answer queries about animal presence, count, and location, bridging visual content with structured queries.

Conclusion: ViLLa offers a modular and interpretable alternative to black-box models for animal monitoring, successfully combining perception, understanding, and reasoning.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D semantic occupancy prediction by addressing issues of unified feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities in existing 3DGS methods.

Method: Proposes Dual Gaussians Graph Attention (geometric and semantic graphs) and Multi-scale Graph Attention for feature aggregation and boundary optimization.

Result: Achieves 24.10% mIoU on SurroundOcc dataset with 1.97% improvement and 13.7% memory reduction (6.1 GB).

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc effectively enhances semantic and geometric feature aggregation, improving performance and efficiency in 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to

TL;DR: MSNeRV, a multi-scale feature fusion framework, improves neural video representation by enhancing temporal consistency and leveraging multi-scale features, outperforming VTM-23.7 in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based methods fail to represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content due to underutilized network features and lack of video-specific design.

Method: Proposes MSNeRV with temporal windows for consistency, GoP-level grids for background, a multi-scale spatial decoder, and a feature block for hidden features.

Result: Outperforms VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in compression efficiency for dynamic scenarios, demonstrating superior representation capability.

Conclusion: MSNeRV addresses limitations of INR-based methods, offering improved video representation and compression for dynamic content.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

TL;DR: DAVID-X introduces a dataset with detailed annotations for AI-generated videos, and DAVID-XR1 is a model providing interpretable reasoning for detection, improving transparency and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated videos necessitates reliable detection methods with clear evidence, beyond binary classification, to convince users and auditors.

Method: DAVID-X pairs AI-generated videos with defect-level annotations and rationales. DAVID-XR1, a video-language model, uses these for interpretable reasoning (defect categorization, localization, and explanations).

Result: The model, fine-tuned on DAVID-X and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, generalizes well across various generators and modes.

Conclusion: Explainable detection methods, as demonstrated by DAVID-XR1, are promising for trustworthy identification of AI-generated videos.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ME analysis methods treat spotting and recognition separately, which is suboptimal for real-world scenarios. The emergence of multimodal models (MLLMs/LVLMs) offers new opportunities for enhanced ME understanding.

Method: The paper proposes two tasks: ME-STR (unified spotting and recognition pipeline) and ME-VQA (visual question answering using MLLMs/LVLMs).

Result: The MEGC 2025 challenge introduces these tasks, requiring algorithms to perform on a test set and submit results for evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper aims to advance ME analysis by integrating multimodal models and unified pipelines, addressing limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a
leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2, with 7B parameters, sets a new standard for video captioning, combining efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-VLDoc improves VrDU tasks by enhancing vision-language interactions through bidirectional supervision and hybrid-attention, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document pre-trained models lack effective vision-language interaction modeling, limiting generalization and accuracy.

Method: Proposes Bi-VLDoc with bidirectional vision-language supervision and hybrid-attention for richer cross-modal representations.

Result: Significant performance gains on benchmarks: Form Understanding (85.14% to 93.44%), Receipt Extraction (96.01% to 97.84%), Document Classification (96.08% to 97.12%), and Document Visual QA.

Conclusion: Bi-VLDoc advances VrDU by better leveraging vision-language interactions, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal document pre-trained models have proven to be very effective in a
variety of visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) tasks. Though existing
document pre-trained models have achieved excellent performance on standard
benchmarks for VrDU, the way they model and exploit the interactions between
vision and language on documents has hindered them from better generalization
ability and higher accuracy. In this work, we investigate the problem of
vision-language joint representation learning for VrDU mainly from the
perspective of supervisory signals. Specifically, a pre-training paradigm
called Bi-VLDoc is proposed, in which a bidirectional vision-language
supervision strategy and a vision-language hybrid-attention mechanism are
devised to fully explore and utilize the interactions between these two
modalities, to learn stronger cross-modal document representations with richer
semantics. Benefiting from the learned informative cross-modal document
representations, Bi-VLDoc significantly advances the state-of-the-art
performance on three widely-used document understanding benchmarks, including
Form Understanding (from 85.14% to 93.44%), Receipt Information Extraction
(from 96.01% to 97.84%), and Document Classification (from 96.08% to 97.12%).
On Document Visual QA, Bi-VLDoc achieves the state-of-the-art performance
compared to previous single model methods.

*Weizhi Zhong, Jichang Li, Yinqi Cai, Ming Li, Feng Gao, Liang Lin, Guanbin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an audio-aware style reference scheme for precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles using a Transformer-based model and conditional latent diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of personalized speaking styles in audio-driven lip sync, where earlier methods fail to preserve unique styles accurately.

Method: Uses a Transformer-based model for lip motion prediction with style aggregation via cross-attention, and a conditional latent diffusion model for realistic video rendering.

Result: Achieves precise lip sync, preserves speaking styles, and generates high-fidelity talking face videos.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses style preservation and realism in audio-driven lip sync.

Abstract: Audio-driven lip sync has recently drawn significant attention due to its
widespread application in the multimedia domain. Individuals exhibit distinct
lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking
styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync.
Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized
speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general
styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary
audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not
preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation.
This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that
effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio
from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip
sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept
at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the
style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style
reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic
talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating
lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial
images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving
speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD introduces a novel DETR-based framework for monocular 3D detection, featuring Mask Separated Self-Attention, Variational Query Denoising, and self-distillation, achieving top performance on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of DETR-like architectures in monocular 3D detection, particularly in stability, denoising efficiency, and query refinement.

Method: Proposes three key techniques: Mask Separated Self-Attention for stable optimization, Variational Query Denoising to mitigate gradient vanishing, and self-distillation for iterative query refinement.

Result: Superior performance on the KITTI benchmark and significant gains in multi-view 3D detection on nuScenes, demonstrating robust generalization.

Conclusion: MonoVQD advances monocular 3D detection with its innovative components, showing broad applicability and strong performance across datasets.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: SurgSora is a framework for generating high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos from a single frame and user-specified motion cues, outperforming existing methods in realism and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical video generation methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism, limiting their utility in medical education and research.

Method: SurgSora uses three modules: Dual Semantic Injector (RGB-D features and segmentation), Decoupled Flow Mapper (optical flow fusion), and Trajectory Controller (user-guided motion). It integrates these with Stable Video Diffusion for precise synthesis.

Result: SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability, validated by quantitative, qualitative, and expert human evaluations.

Conclusion: SurgSora demonstrates high realism and potential for surgical training, advancing the field of surgical video synthesis.

Abstract: Surgical video generation can enhance medical education and research, but
existing methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism. We introduce
SurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable
surgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues.
Unlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on
ground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object
features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for
precise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual
Semantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and
segmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow
Mapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for
realistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates
sparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning
these enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves
state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical
video synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative
comparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further
demonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the
potential of our method for surgical training and education. Our project is

*Chengzhi Xu, Yuyang Wang, Lai Wei, Lichao Sun, Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartIR, an iterative refinement method for improving chart-to-code generation in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by using structured instructions and a two-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with chart-to-code generation due to the need for precise visual understanding and accurate code translation, leading to suboptimal results when directly prompted.

Method: ChartIR splits the task into visual understanding (using description and difference instructions) and code translation, followed by a two-stage pipeline of initial code generation and iterative refinement.

Result: The method outperforms others on models like Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: ChartIR effectively enhances chart-to-code generation in MLLMs by leveraging structured instructions and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets reflecting blind individuals' needs for visual assistance and evaluate MLLMs' capabilities in this context.

Method: Collects 1,392 egocentric videos and 5,311 questions from blind users, evaluates 16 MLLMs, and analyzes their performance.

Result: MLLMs perform poorly (best accuracy ~60%) compared to humans (87.4%). Major limitations in egocentric visual assistance are identified.

Conclusion: EgoBlind provides a foundation for improving AI assistants for the blind, highlighting current MLLM shortcomings and suggesting future directions.

Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from
blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,392 videos that
record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It
also features 5,311 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind
individuals to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance under
various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference
answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively
evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best
performers achieving accuracy near 60\%, far behind human performance of
87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major
limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and
explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope
EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI
assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives. Data

*Lukas Schiesser, Cornelius Wolff, Sophie Haas, Simon Pukrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictSure is an ICL framework for few-shot image classification, focusing on embedding models to improve out-of-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the overlooked role of image embeddings in ICL-based FSIC pipelines to enhance generalization in data-scarce domains.

Method: Systematically analyzes visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies for embedding models.

Result: Outperforms existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks while maintaining in-domain performance.

Conclusion: Embedding model pretraining is critical for FSIC success, and PictSure demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size selection in CNNs, improving accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size selection in CNNs is often overlooked but impacts model performance. The paper aims to optimize this parameter systematically.

Method: Proposes BKSEF, integrating information theory, signal processing, and learning theory for layer-wise kernel size determination.

Result: BKSEF achieves up to 3.1% accuracy improvement and 42.8% FLOPs reduction on various datasets. Case studies confirm practical benefits.

Conclusion: BKSEF transforms kernel size into an optimizable parameter, offering theoretical and practical support for efficient CNN designs.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

*Varun Mannam, Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method automates key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos, reducing manual effort and costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual video annotation in retail is time-consuming and costly, requiring automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational expenses.

Method: Uses deep neural networks for discriminative feature learning and object detection tailored to retail environments.

Result: Achieves human-level accuracy with 2x cost savings, requiring human verification for less than 5% of frames.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces annotation costs and effort, benefiting retail applications like shopper analysis and security monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang, Feng Xu, Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UPNet, a lightweight neural network for active view selection (AVS) in 3D reconstruction, predicting uncertainty maps to select the most informative viewpoints efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying minimal yet informative viewpoints for accurate 3D reconstruction, avoiding redundant computations and improving efficiency.

Method: UPNet predicts uncertainty maps from a single input image, using heuristics to guide viewpoint selection. Aggregated uncertainty maps suppress redundant views, and selected viewpoints train 3D neural rendering models.

Result: Achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy with half the viewpoints, 400x speedup, and 50%+ reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage. Generalizes to novel object categories without retraining.

Conclusion: UPNet offers a scalable, efficient, and generalizable solution for AVS in 3D reconstruction, outperforming baseline methods in speed and resource usage.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Motivation: To improve alignment in T2I models, ensuring they capture user intent while addressing safety and fairness concerns.

Method: Proposes DPO-Kernels with Hybrid Loss, Kernelized Representations, and Divergence Selection. Introduces DETONATE benchmark and AQI metric.

Result: DPO-Kernels enhance alignment, with empirical validation via HT-SR. DETONATE provides a large-scale benchmark for social bias.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels effectively improve T2I alignment, and DETONATE serves as a valuable resource for evaluating fairness and safety.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are

Method: Introduces PeRL with permutation of image sequences and a rollout filtering mechanism to enhance exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Result: PeRL outperforms baselines on multi-image benchmarks and matches performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: PeRL effectively addresses the challenge of multi-image positional reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

### [124] [Frequency-Calibrated Membership Inference Attacks on Medical Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14919)
*Xinkai Zhao, Yuta Tokuoka, Junichiro Iwasawa, Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on medical image diffusion models, outperforming existing methods by focusing on mid-frequency reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in medical imaging due to diffusion models, with existing MIA methods failing to address challenges like inherent image difficulty and high-frequency detail reconstruction.

Method: FCRE focuses on mid-frequency reconstruction errors, excluding high and low frequencies, and uses structural similarity index scores for membership determination.

Result: FCRE outperforms existing MIA methods on medical image datasets.

Conclusion: The FCRE method effectively mitigates privacy risks in medical image diffusion models by improving MIA accuracy.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

*Md Abrar Jahin, Shahriar Soudeep, Arian Rahman Aditta, M. F. Mridha, Nafiz Fahad, Md. Jakir Hossen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Vision Transformer (ViT) and hybrid ViT-CNN models for quark-gluon jet classification, showing they outperform CNNs in accuracy and other metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving jet tagging is crucial for new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. ViTs' potential for this task is underexplored.

Method: The study uses simulated 2012 CMS Open Data to construct multi-channel jet-view images from energy deposits and tracks, evaluating ViT and hybrid models.

Result: ViT-based models, especially hybrids like ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt, outperform CNNs in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The work provides a systematic framework and benchmarks for using ViTs in jet classification, with a dataset for future research.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

*Ziteng Li, Malte Kuhlmann, Ilana Nisky, Nicolás Navarro-Guerrero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LRCN and Transformer models using GelSight tactile images for accurate compliance prediction, outperforming baselines and highlighting challenges with harder objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection lacks portability and scalability; existing neural methods have low accuracy.

Method: Uses LRCN and Transformer models with GelSight RGB tactile images to predict compliance.

Result: Models show significant improvement over baselines; harder objects are more challenging to estimate.

Conclusion: Proposed models enhance compliance prediction accuracy, though harder objects remain a challenge.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

### [127] [Hyper-Local Deformable Transformers for Text Spotting on Historical Maps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15010)
*Yijun Lin, Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALETTE is an end-to-end text spotter for historical maps, addressing challenges in text extraction with a hyper-local sampling module and synthetic training data (SynthMap+). It outperforms state-of-the-art methods and has been applied to label over 100 million texts in a large map collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps contain valuable georeferenced text, but extraction is difficult due to lack of methods and training data. Existing approaches are limited to specific map styles, and machine learning-based methods struggle with precise feature extraction for complex map text.

Method: PALETTE introduces a hyper-local sampling module to learn localized image features for boundary points and characters, along with hyper-local positional embeddings for spatial interactions. SynthMap+ generates synthetic map images for training.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on benchmark datasets, especially for long and angled text. It processed 60,000 maps, generating 100M+ labels for the David Rumsey collection.

Conclusion: PALETTE effectively addresses historical map text extraction challenges, demonstrating superior performance and scalability for large collections.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer is a unified framework for style transfer, addressing traditional issues and enabling artist-level results. It uses semantic-based style injection, data augmentation with human feedback, and a training-free triple diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional style transfer methods and unify frameworks for diverse tasks, enabling high-quality, artist-level style transfer and text-driven stylization.

Method: 1. Semantic-based style injection using BLIP and CLIP. 2. Data augmentation with human feedback. 3. Training-free triple diffusion process for style injection and content preservation.

Result: High-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, with artist-level results and preserved content. First-time achievement of image color editing during style transfer.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer revolutionizes style transfer by unifying frameworks, improving quality, and enabling new capabilities like color editing.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

*Deepank Singh, Vedhus Hoskere, Pietro Milillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based framework combining satellite imagery and building-specific metadata improves multiclass post-earthquake damage assessment, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual damage assessments are slow and risky; existing automated methods lack accuracy and practicality.

Method: Uses high-resolution satellite imagery and metadata (seismic intensity, soil properties, SAR maps) in a transformer-based model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass damage identification for the Turkey-Syria earthquake, with improved accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: The framework enables faster, more precise building-level damage assessments, enhancing disaster response and recovery.

Abstract: Timely and accurate assessments of building damage are crucial for effective
response and recovery in the aftermath of earthquakes. Conventional preliminary
damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which
are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely
expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of
satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches.
These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at
the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of
such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we
introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines
high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific
metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage
identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6,
2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic
intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only
enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage
classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions.
Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance
to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building
damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely
contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite
imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate
damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can
improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected
communities.

*Xianghong Fang, Litao Guo, Hengchao Chen, Yuxuan Zhang, XiaofanXia, Dingjie Song, Yexin Liu, Hao Wang, Harry Yang, Yuan Yuan, Qiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions in vector quantization, addressing training instability and codebook collapse, achieving near 100% codebook utilization and reduced quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods suffer from training instability and codebook collapse due to mismatched distributions of features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and information loss.

Method: The authors employ Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors, ensuring better representation and utilization.

Result: The approach achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduces quantization error, validated empirically and theoretically.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates training instability and codebook collapse, improving the performance of autoregressive models.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Yufei Liu, Haoke Xiao, Jiaxing Chai, Yongcun Zhang, Rong Wang, Zijie Meng, Zhiming Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPo improves few-shot medical image segmentation by enhancing negative prompts in LVMs like SAM, using a Confidence Map Synergy Module and K-means clustering for point selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods based on LVMs underutilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images.

Method: SynPo combines DINOv2 and SAM to create a reliable confidence map, selects top-k positive and Gaussian-distributed negative points, and applies K-means clustering for high-quality prompts.

Result: SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: SynPo effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by improving negative prompt quality, offering a robust training-free solution.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

*Jiaqi Shi, Jin Xiao, Xiaoguang Hu, Boyang Song, Hao Jiang, Tianyou Chen, Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) to improve point cloud analysis by addressing irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gaps, enhancing computational efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aggregating local structures in point clouds suffer from irrelevant point interference, feature hierarchy gaps, high computational overhead, and noise sensitivity.

Method: PDSA corrects feature distribution using high-dimensional correlations, employs a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and introduces a key point mechanism to optimize computation.

Result: Experiments on semantic segmentation and classification tasks show significant performance improvements with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: PDSA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering better efficiency and robustness in point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Echo-DND, a dual-noise diffusion model, improves LV segmentation in noisy echocardiograms using Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, multi-scale fusion, and spatial coherence, outperforming SOTA models with high Dice scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LV segmentation in noisy, low-contrast echocardiograms is critical for diagnostics but challenging due to ambiguous boundaries.

Method: Echo-DND combines Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, uses multi-scale fusion conditioning, and spatial coherence calibration.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.962 (CAMUS) and 0.939 (EchoNet-Dynamic), outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: Echo-DND sets a new standard for echocardiogram segmentation and shows potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

*Ziling Huang, Yidan Zhang, Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSeDis unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding, addressing both image relevance and object localization in visual search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on retrieval or grounding, but not both, limiting their effectiveness in large-scale visual search.

Method: Introduces the ReSeDis task, combining retrieval and grounding, and provides a benchmark with unique object-description mappings.

Result: A zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model shows potential but leaves room for improvement.

Conclusion: ReSeDis offers a realistic testbed for advancing multimodal search systems by integrating retrieval and localization.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized models are limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and resources, while generalist models offer broader utility.

Method: Uses VICL to train models for generalization across tasks based on few examples at inference time, with a tailored evaluation protocol for OCT.

Result: Evaluates a state-of-the-art VICL approach on multiple OCT datasets, establishing a baseline for in-context learning in OCT.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential and limitations of VICL for OCT, releasing code to encourage further research and adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

*Xuelin Shen, Jiayin Xu, Kangsheng Yin, Wenhan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC) to protect images from exploitation by vision-language models while maintaining compression functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard user privacy against advanced vision-language models that exploit publicly posted images.

Method: Introduces PSIC with a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module and Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization, enabling flexible decoding options.

Result: Effective protection against VLP models while preserving image quality and compression functionality, validated across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: PSIC is a plug-and-play solution for privacy protection in image compression, adaptable to existing models.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

*Dan He, Weisheng Li, Guofen Wang, Yuping Huang, Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) for multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF), addressing limitations in existing methods by enhancing feature interaction and detail capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods struggle with detailed feature capture and cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality.

Method: A two-stage approach: Stage I uses a diffusion process with UNet for image reconstruction, while Stage II inputs noisy images into a fusion network with adaptive modules. A hybrid loss function optimizes brightness, color, contrast, and detail.

Result: The method outperforms others in objective metrics, producing fused images with balanced brightness, rich textures, and clear edges.

Conclusion: DM-FNet effectively improves MMIF quality by leveraging diffusion models and adaptive fusion modules, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR ship detection faces challenges like scale variations, small vessel noise, and complex backgrounds, necessitating improved feature representation and fusion.

Method: C-AFBiFPN introduces a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module and integrates BiFormer attention into BiFPN fusion, creating AFBiFPN for better global modeling and adaptive feature focus.

Result: Experiments on SSDD show enhanced detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and improved multi-scale feature adaptability.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN effectively addresses SAR ship detection challenges, offering superior performance in feature enhancement and fusion.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

*Qingsong Yan, Qiang Wang, Kaiyong Zhao, Jie Chen, Bo Li, Xiaowen Chu, Fei Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RA-NeRF improves camera pose estimation for 3D reconstruction by combining NeRF with flow-driven pose regulation and an implicit pose filter, outperforming existing methods on complex trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction and SLAM rely on accurate camera pose priors but struggle with complex trajectories, limiting their performance.

Method: RA-NeRF integrates photometric consistency in NeRF, flow-driven pose regulation for robustness, and an implicit pose filter to refine camera movement patterns.

Result: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in pose estimation and visual quality on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF effectively addresses the challenge of complex camera trajectories, enhancing scene reconstruction accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

*Chenxi Zhang, Jiayun Wu, Qing Zhang, Yazhe Zhai, Youwei Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetroMem introduces a recall-augmented COD architecture with dynamic memory and multi-scale adapters to improve camouflage detection by leveraging historical context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack mechanisms for historical context, limiting adaptability in complex camouflage scenes.

Method: Two-stage training: learning stage with dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) and recall stage with dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and inference pattern reconstruction (IPR).

Result: RetroMem outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating historical knowledge dynamically enhances COD performance, proving RetroMem's effectiveness.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The approaches are validated on real-world Electron Microscope images, showing effectiveness in advancing DA for semiconductor applications.

Conclusion: DBACS proves useful for DA in semiconductors, reducing resource costs and enabling focus on high-value tasks.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

TL;DR: BCRNet improves landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery using Bezier curve refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of anatomical structures in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging; AR systems with precise landmark detection can enhance surgical navigation.

Method: BCRNet uses Multi-modal Feature Extraction, Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization, and Hierarchical Curve Refinement for precise Bezier curve detection.

Result: BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on L3D and P2ILF datasets.

Conclusion: BCRNet offers a robust solution for landmark detection in laparoscopic surgery, improving surgical navigation.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

TL;DR: ViMAT is an AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks without rigid setups or markers, validated on LEGO and hydraulic press tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for visual monitoring require rigid setups or markers, limiting flexibility. ViMAT aims to overcome these constraints.

Method: ViMAT combines a perception module (extracts visual data from multi-view videos) and a reasoning module (infers actions based on observations and task knowledge).

Result: Validated on LEGO and hydraulic press tasks, ViMAT shows effectiveness in challenging real-world scenarios with partial/uncertain observations.

Conclusion: ViMAT offers a flexible, marker-free solution for real-time assembly task monitoring, demonstrated in practical applications.

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing
equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although
commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or
the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT,
a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that
operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that
extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning
module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed
assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly
tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of
hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and
qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by
partial and uncertain visual observations. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-definition (HD) maps and semantic maps in bird's-eye view (BEV) are crucial for autonomous driving tasks like localization and planning, but generating them accurately online is challenging.

Result: The approach enhances feature representation and prediction quality, leading to higher accuracy and improved vectorized HD maps.

Conclusion: MapFM demonstrates the effectiveness of combining foundation models and multi-task learning for superior online HD map generation in autonomous driving.

### [145] [OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15318)
*Lanfeng Zhong, Xin Liao, Shichuan Zhang, Shaoting Zhang, Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenPath is a novel open-set active learning method for pathology image classification, leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model to efficiently select informative in-distribution samples while avoiding out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning methods assume a closed-set scenario and waste labeling costs on out-of-distribution data, which is common in real-world clinical settings.

Method: OpenPath uses task-specific prompts in the first query and Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) in subsequent queries to ensure sample purity and informativeness.

Result: Experiments show OpenPath outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods, enhancing model performance with high sample purity.

Conclusion: OpenPath effectively addresses the challenges of open-set active learning in pathology image classification, reducing labeling effort and improving efficiency.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountVid, a model for open-world object counting in videos, addressing challenges like occlusions and double counting. It uses an image-based counting model and video segmentation for accurate counts, validated on the new VideoCount dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of counting unique object instances in videos, especially in crowded scenes with occlusions, is challenging and lacks dedicated solutions. The paper aims to automate this process for open-world scenarios.

Method: CountVid combines an image-based counting model with a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to count objects across video frames.

Result: CountVid outperforms baselines on the VideoCount dataset, demonstrating accurate object counting in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper presents a robust solution for open-world object counting in videos, validated by a new dataset and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

TL;DR: A geometry-aware texture mapping method improves animal re-identification by unwarping deformable fur patterns into a canonical UV space, enhancing feature matching robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with geometric distortions in animal fur or skin patterns due to movement and posture changes.

Method: Proposes a geometry-aware texture mapping approach using surface normal estimation to unwarp pelage patterns into UV space, preserving geometric consistency.

Result: Achieves up to 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy for Saimaa ringed seals and leopards.

Conclusion: The method enhances re-identification accuracy without requiring ground truth UV annotations, using self-supervised training.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDIS introduces a diffusion-assisted method for data-free image synthesis, leveraging a text-to-image diffusion model to improve synthetic image quality and alignment with training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFIS methods produce samples deviating from the training data distribution due to lack of natural image priors.

Method: DDIS uses a diffusion model as an image prior, introduces Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG), and optimizes a Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding.

Result: DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods, generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution (SOTA on PACS and ImageNet).

Conclusion: DDIS advances data-free image synthesis by effectively leveraging diffusion models and alignment techniques.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NERO, a novel OOD scoring mechanism for medical imaging, leveraging neuron-level relevance and clustering to improve OOD detection, validated on gastrointestinal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability in deep learning for medical imaging is critical, especially for detecting OOD samples that could indicate anomalies. Existing methods may not fully capture OOD diversity.

Method: NERO clusters neuron-level relevance for ID classes to form centroids and uses a relevance distance metric for OOD detection. It also incorporates scaled relevance and feature norms.

Result: NERO outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks (Kvasir and GastroVision).

Conclusion: NERO enhances OOD separability and explainability, proving effective for medical imaging reliability.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

*Farheen Ramzan, Yusuf Kiberu, Nikesh Jathanna, Shahnaz Jamil-Copley, Richard H. Clayton, Chen, Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLAIM is a framework for generating realistic and diverse myocardial scar images using clinical guidance, improving segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability and variability of high-quality labeled LGE images hinder robust scar segmentation model development.

Method: CLAIM uses the SMILE module (clinical knowledge-guided scar mask generation) and a diffusion-based generator for anatomically consistent scar synthesis. It employs joint training of the generator and segmentation network.

Result: CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scars and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions than baselines.

Conclusion: CLAIM enables controllable, realistic scar synthesis and enhances downstream medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

### [155] [RaCalNet: Radar Calibration Network for Sparse-Supervised Metric Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15560)
*Xingrui Qin, Wentao Zhao, Chuan Cao, Yihe Niu, Houcheng Jiang, Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet eliminates dense LiDAR supervision for radar-based depth estimation, using sparse LiDAR to achieve comparable or better results with only 1% supervision density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense LiDAR supervision for radar-based depth estimation is costly and data-intensive. RaCalNet aims to reduce this dependency while maintaining accuracy.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates sparse radar points to create depth priors, guiding monocular depth prediction without dense supervision.

Result: RaCalNet outperforms dense-supervised methods, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89% on datasets, with clearer object contours and textures.

Conclusion: RaCalNet demonstrates that sparse supervision can achieve superior depth estimation, reducing costs and data requirements.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

*Bonan Li, Yinhan Hu, Songhua Liu, Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WinWinLay introduces a training-free method for Layout-to-Image generation, addressing imprecise localization and artifacts with Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using pre-trained Text-to-Image models struggle with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts.

Method: Proposes two strategies: Non-local Attention Energy Function to redistribute attention scores for better alignment, and Adaptive Update using Langevin dynamics to avoid out-of-distribution artifacts.

Result: WinWinLay outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precise control and photorealistic fidelity.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances control precision and realism in Layout-to-Image generation.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised framework for ultra-high-resolution land cover classification, using SAM2 knowledge and a FreqWeaver Adapter, achieves better results with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in fine-grained land cover analysis due to high annotation costs, scale variation, and limited adaptability of large-scale models.

Method: Proposes a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m resolution imagery, using SAM2 and a FreqWeaver Adapter.

Result: Achieves 1.78% improvement over parameter-efficient tuning and 3.44% gain over state-of-the-art high-resolution methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages unlabeled data and maintains low parameter overhead for robust segmentation.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

*Di Wang, Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel graph-based framework for end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction improves large-scale AGB estimation, reducing reliance on high-quality TLS data and pre-processing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QSM methods for AGB estimation are limited by their focus on individual trees, dependence on TLS data, and extensive pre-processing, hindering scalability.

Method: The study introduces a unified graph-based pipeline integrating tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations.

Result: The framework performs well in leaf-on (~20% error) and low-density ULS (~30% error) scenarios, proving robust and scalable.

Conclusion: The method advances QSM-based AGB estimation, enabling operational-scale applications and reducing dependency on TLS, with potential for broader forest and climate research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### [160] [One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15591)
*Yujing Sun, Lingchen Sun, Shuaizheng Liu, Rongyuan Wu, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm for Real-VSR, combining Cross-Frame Retrieval and Consistency/Detail-LoRA modules to enhance spatial details while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often sacrifice spatial details for temporal consistency, leading to suboptimal visual quality. The goal is to extract degradation-robust temporal priors and enhance details without losing coherence.

Method: DLoRAL uses a Cross-Frame Retrieval module and two LoRA branches (Consistency-LoRA and Detail-LoRA) trained iteratively. The former learns temporal consistency from degraded inputs, while the latter enhances details while aligning with the temporal space.

Result: DLoRAL achieves strong performance in accuracy and speed, delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs in a single diffusion step.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances spatial detail enhancement and temporal consistency, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2M-Reg improves multi-modal deformable image registration by using mono-modal similarity and introduces GradCyCon for diffeomorphism, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DIR methods struggle with highly heterogeneous modalities due to unreliable similarity metrics.

Method: Proposes M2M-Reg, a framework using mono-modal similarity, and GradCyCon for regularization. Extends to semi-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration on ADNI dataset.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg effectively handles heterogeneous multi-modal DIR and integrates seamlessly into existing models.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction-free online framework for open-vocabulary 3D object detection, leveraging pre-trained models and multi-view fusion for real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational overhead and memory constraints in existing dense point cloud reconstruction methods for real-time deployment.

Method: Uses Cubify Anything and CLIP for single-view detection, with association and optimization modules for multi-view fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets, enabling real-time perception in large environments.

Conclusion: The reconstruction-free paradigm offers efficient, real-time 3D detection with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi is a text-driven diffusion framework for realistic human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis, optimizing noise space for both realism and physical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI generation is challenging due to strict contact accuracy and diverse motion requirements. Current methods compromise between realism and correctness.

Method: HOIDiNi uses Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) in two phases: object-centric (contact choices) and human-centric (motion refinement).

Result: Outperforms prior works in contact accuracy, physical validity, and quality on the GRAB dataset.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi generates complex, controllable HOIs from text prompts, balancing realism and physical correctness.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator to evaluate memory-based capabilities in robotics, addressing limitations of current VLMs in handling long-term experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with long-term memory in embodied contexts, limiting their deployment in robotics for tasks requiring sustained engagement and fine-grained reasoning.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark with 60 tasks in the Habitat simulator, designed to assess memory and reasoning. They integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with navigation policies to establish baselines.

Result: The benchmark enables scalable evaluation of memory-intensive tasks, highlighting areas where VLMs need improvement in recalling and acting on historical information.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for advancing VLMs in embodied settings by focusing on memory integration and long-horizon control, with potential for procedural extension to more complex tasks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

*Shuo Xing, Lanqing Guo, Hongyuan Hua, Seoyoung Lee, Peiran Li, Yufei Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs perform better with degraded images, not high-fidelity ones. VQ-TTT adapts images to model preferences, boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how visual quality affects MLLM performance, given their benchmark success but unclear visual input preferences.

Method: Systematic study with controlled image degradations and stylistic shifts, introducing VQ-TTT for adaptive image adjustment.

Result: Visual-quality paradox: degraded images improve performance. VQ-TTT enhances accuracy across MLLMs and datasets.

Conclusion: MLLMs prefer adaptive, not universally clean, images. VQ-TTT offers a lightweight solution for aligning inputs with model preferences.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Motivation: Existing inference-time search methods for VLMs are computationally expensive and prone to low-confidence generations, leading to persistent hallucinations. ViMaR aims to address these issues.

Method: ViMaR uses a temporal-difference value model and margin-aware reward adjustment. It first identifies the highest-value caption and then selectively refines weak segments, applying a margin-based penalty to discourage low-confidence outputs.

Result: ViMaR generates more reliable, accurate, and detailed captions with a 4× speedup. It also generalizes to unseen models and improves caption quality when adapted to stronger models.

Conclusion: ViMaR is a scalable, transferable, and self-improving inference-time decoding strategy, enhancing VLM performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

*Kai He, Ruofan Liang, Jacob Munkberg, Jon Hasselgren, Nandita Vijaykumar, Alexander Keller, Sanja Fidler, Igor Gilitschenski, Zan Gojcic, Zian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel joint approach for image/video relighting using video diffusion models, improving realism and generalization without paired multi-illumination data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing relighting methods—either data scarcity in end-to-end models or error accumulation in two-stage pipelines—by integrating albedo estimation and relighting synthesis.

Method: Jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in one pass using video diffusion models, trained on synthetic and real-world video data.

Result: Achieves superior visual fidelity and temporal consistency, generalizing well across diverse scenes and materials.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances relighting by combining generative capabilities with joint optimization, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sekai, a high-quality first-person video dataset for world exploration, addressing limitations in existing datasets. It includes 5,000+ hours of annotated videos from 100+ countries and trains an interactive model, YUME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack diversity, duration, and annotations for world exploration, limiting their utility.

Method: Developed a toolbox to collect, pre-process, and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, and more. Used a subset to train the YUME model.

Result: Sekai dataset is high-quality and diverse, and YUME demonstrates its potential for interactive world exploration.

Conclusion: Sekai advances video generation and world exploration, enabling valuable applications.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

*Anirud Aggarwal, Abhinav Shrivastava, Matthew Gwilliam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECAD introduces a genetic algorithm for optimizing caching schedules in diffusion models, improving speed and quality without modifying the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are slow and computationally expensive; existing caching methods are rigid and lack generalization.

Method: ECAD uses a genetic algorithm to learn efficient, per-model caching schedules, requiring no model modifications.

Result: ECAD achieves significant speedups (e.g., 2.58x on PixArt-alpha) and better quality (4.47 FID improvement) over prior methods.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable, generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion models, validated across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

*Yinsong Xu, Aidong Men, Yang Liu, Xiahai Zhuang, Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of pre-training on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), revealing its role in target error and proposing TriDA, a framework to address these issues by incorporating pre-training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training's impact on UDA is understudied, and the paper aims to understand its role in domain adaptation errors and improve performance.

Method: Analyzes pre-training's effect, identifies two error sources, and introduces TriDA, a framework integrating pre-training data into UDA. Includes data selection and synthetic image solutions.

Result: TriDA improves UDA performance, even with minimal pre-training data, and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study highlights pre-training's significance in UDA and offers a practical solution (TriDA) for better adaptation performance.

Abstract: In deep learning, initializing models with pre-trained weights has become the
de facto practice for various downstream tasks. Many unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods typically adopt a backbone pre-trained on ImageNet,
and focus on reducing the source-target domain discrepancy. However, the impact
of pre-training on adaptation received little attention. In this study, we
delve into UDA from the novel perspective of pre-training. We first demonstrate
the impact of pre-training by analyzing the dynamic distribution discrepancies
between pre-training data domain and the source/ target domain during
adaptation. Then, we reveal that the target error also stems from the
pre-training in the following two factors: 1) empirically, target error arises
from the gradually degenerative pre-trained knowledge during adaptation; 2)
theoretically, the error bound depends on difference between the gradient of
loss function, \ie, on the target domain and pre-training data domain. To
address these two issues, we redefine UDA as a three-domain problem, \ie,
source domain, target domain, and pre-training data domain; then we propose a
novel framework, named TriDA. We maintain the pre-trained knowledge and improve
the error bound by incorporating pre-training data into adaptation for both
vanilla UDA and source-free UDA scenarios. For efficiency, we introduce a
selection strategy for pre-training data, and offer a solution with synthesized
images when pre-training data is unavailable during adaptation. Notably, TriDA
is effective even with a small amount of pre-training or synthesized images,
and seamlessly complements the two scenario UDA methods, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We hope our work
provides new insights for better understanding and application of domain
adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanopticNeRF-360 combines coarse 3D annotations and noisy 2D semantic cues to generate high-quality panoptic labels and images from any viewpoint, improving generalization for perception models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of 2D annotations for self-driving car perception systems is labor-intensive, and existing datasets lack labels for rare viewpoints, limiting model generalization.

Method: Leverages coarse 3D bounding primitives and noisy 2D predictions to guide geometry optimization, while a learned semantic field filters noise. Uses MLP and hash grids for hybrid scene features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 dataset, enabling high-fidelity omnidirectional rendering of appearance, semantic, and instance labels.

Conclusion: PanopticNeRF-360 effectively enhances geometry and semantics, offering a scalable solution for generating diverse training data for perception systems.

Abstract: Training perception systems for self-driving cars requires substantial 2D
annotations that are labor-intensive to manual label. While existing datasets
provide rich annotations on pre-recorded sequences, they fall short in labeling
rarely encountered viewpoints, potentially hampering the generalization ability
for perception models. In this paper, we present PanopticNeRF-360, a novel
approach that combines coarse 3D annotations with noisy 2D semantic cues to
generate high-quality panoptic labels and images from any viewpoint. Our key
insight lies in exploiting the complementarity of 3D and 2D priors to mutually
enhance geometry and semantics. Specifically, we propose to leverage coarse 3D
bounding primitives and noisy 2D semantic and instance predictions to guide
geometry optimization, by encouraging predicted labels to match panoptic pseudo
ground truth. Simultaneously, the improved geometry assists in filtering 3D&2D
annotation noise by fusing semantics in 3D space via a learned semantic field.
To further enhance appearance, we combine MLP and hash grids to yield hybrid
scene features, striking a balance between high-frequency appearance and
contiguous semantics. Our experiments demonstrate PanopticNeRF-360's
state-of-the-art performance over label transfer methods on the challenging
urban scenes of the KITTI-360 dataset. Moreover, PanopticNeRF-360 enables
omnidirectional rendering of high-fidelity, multi-view and spatiotemporally
consistent appearance, semantic and instance labels. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/fuxiao0719/PanopticNeRF

*Jingyuan Yang, Jiawei Feng, Weibin Luo, Dani Lischinski, Daniel Cohen-Or, Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoEdit enhances Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) by incorporating content modifications and introducing an Emotion adapter, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIM methods focus on color and style adjustments, often failing to evoke precise emotions. EmoEdit addresses this by integrating psychological insights and content changes.

Method: Constructs EmoEditSet dataset (40,120 pairs), designs an Emotion adapter for generative models, and introduces an instruction loss for semantic variations.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show superior performance. The Emotion adapter also enhances other diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: EmoEdit advances AIM by combining content modifications and emotion-aware adapters, offering broader applicability.

Abstract: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) seeks to modify user-provided images to
evoke specific emotional responses. This task is inherently complex due to its
twofold objective: significantly evoking the intended emotion, while preserving
the original image composition. Existing AIM methods primarily adjust color and
style, often failing to elicit precise and profound emotional shifts. Drawing
on psychological insights, we introduce EmoEdit, which extends AIM by
incorporating content modifications to enhance emotional impact. Specifically,
we first construct EmoEditSet, a large-scale AIM dataset comprising 40,120
paired data through emotion attribution and data construction. To make existing
generative models emotion-aware, we design the Emotion adapter and train it
using EmoEditSet. We further propose an instruction loss to capture the
semantic variations in data pairs. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively
and quantitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we showcase the portability of our
Emotion adapter to other diffusion-based models, enhancing their emotion
knowledge with diverse semantics.

*Vaibhav Vavilala, Florian Kluger, Seemandhar Jain, Bodo Rosenhahn, Anand Bhattad, David Forsyth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for scene description using geometric primitives, including negative primitives, and evaluates its performance on depth representation and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in accurately describing scenes with varying numbers of interacting primitives, and existing methods lack the ability to incorporate negative primitives effectively.

Method: The approach involves a learned regression to predict primitives, followed by refinement. It introduces negative primitives and uses ensembling to determine their numbers.

Result: The method improves depth representation and segmentation on the NYUv2 dataset, with negative primitives significantly boosting accuracy. It also performs well on LAION images.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances scene abstraction by incorporating negative primitives and demonstrates robust performance across datasets.

Abstract: Describing a scene in terms of primitives -- geometrically simple shapes that
offer a parsimonious but accurate abstraction of structure -- is an established
and difficult fitting problem. Different scenes require different numbers of
primitives, and these primitives interact strongly. Existing methods are
evaluated by predicting depth, normals and segmentation from the primitives,
then evaluating the accuracy of those predictions. The state of the art method
involves a learned regression procedure to predict a start point consisting of
a fixed number of primitives, followed by a descent method to refine the
geometry and remove redundant primitives.
  CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) representations are significantly enhanced
by a set-differencing operation. Our representation incorporates negative
primitives, which are differenced from the positive primitives. These notably
enrich the geometry that the model can encode, while complicating the fitting
problem. This paper demonstrates a method that can (a) incorporate these
negative primitives and (b) choose the overall number of positive and negative
primitives by ensembling. Extensive experiments on the standard NYUv2 dataset
confirm that (a) this approach results in substantial improvements in depth
representation and segmentation over SOTA and (b) negative primitives make a
notable contribution to accuracy. Our method is robustly applicable across
datasets: in a first, we evaluate primitive prediction for LAION images.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalized OOD detection framework (v2) to unify related fields like anomaly detection, novelty detection, and others, especially in the context of Vision Language Models (VLMs). It reviews methodology, benchmarks, and emerging trends in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs).

Motivation: To address the confusion caused by VLMs blurring the boundaries between OOD detection and related fields, and to provide a unified framework for researchers.

Method: The paper surveys and categorizes existing literature, updates the generalized OOD detection framework (v2), and reviews methodologies and benchmarks.

Result: The framework highlights OOD detection and anomaly detection as key challenges, with updated definitions and problem settings. It also explores advancements in LVLMs like GPT-4V.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with open challenges and future directions, providing a resource for further research in the field.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for ensuring the
safety of machine learning systems and has shaped the field of OOD detection.
Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection,
including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition
(OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD
detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five
problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have
significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these
fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a
generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of these fields in
the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and
integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. Then,
we highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and
benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD
detection and related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection.
Finally, we explore the advancements in the emerging Large Vision Language
Model (LVLM) era, such as GPT-4V. We conclude with open challenges and future
directions. The resource is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BFSSL, a motion blur-resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) method, and DRL-BFSSL, a resource allocation scheme, to address privacy, motion blur, and energy efficiency in IoV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance privacy and efficiency in IoV by eliminating data labeling, reducing privacy risks, and mitigating motion blur effects in FSSL.

Method: Uses SimCo (dual temperature) for privacy-preserving FSSL, extends it to BFSSL for motion blur resistance, and employs DRL for resource allocation (DRL-BFSSL).

Result: Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of BFSSL and DRL-BFSSL in improving privacy, reducing motion blur impact, and optimizing energy and latency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for IoV applications.

Abstract: In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Federated Learning (FL) provides a
privacy-preserving solution by aggregating local models without sharing data.
Traditional supervised learning requires image data with labels, but data
labeling involves significant manual effort. Federated Self-Supervised Learning
(FSSL) utilizes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for local training in FL,
eliminating the need for labels while protecting privacy. Compared to other SSL
methods, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) reduces the demand for computing resources
and storage space by creating a dictionary. However, using MoCo in FSSL
requires uploading the local dictionary from vehicles to Base Station (BS),
which poses a risk of privacy leakage. Simplified Contrast (SimCo) addresses
the privacy leakage issue in MoCo-based FSSL by using dual temperature instead
of a dictionary to control sample distribution. Additionally, considering the
negative impact of motion blur on model aggregation, and based on SimCo, we
propose a motion blur-resistant FSSL method, referred to as BFSSL. Furthermore,
we address energy consumption and delay in the BFSSL process by proposing a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme, called
DRL-BFSSL. In this scheme, BS allocates the Central Processing Unit (CPU)
frequency and transmission power of vehicles to minimize energy consumption and
latency, while aggregating received models based on the motion blur level.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed aggregation and
resource allocation methods.

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning framework for V2X cooperative perception eliminates the need for costly 3D annotations by leveraging unlabeled data and a novel proxy task for LiDAR point cloud reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X methods require expensive and time-consuming 3D annotations, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: The framework aggregates multi-agent sensing data, formulates a proxy task for LiDAR point cloud reconstruction, and uses a BEV-guided masking strategy to focus on 3D features.

Result: Achieves a 4% mAP improvement on V2X-Real and outperforms baselines with only 50% training data, demonstrating data efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, data-efficient, and compatible with existing cooperative perception backbones, with strong cross-domain transferability.

Abstract: Existing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception methods rely on
accurate multi-agent 3D annotations. Nevertheless, it is time-consuming and
expensive to collect and annotate real-world data, especially for V2X systems.
In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning framwork for V2X
cooperative perception, which utilizes the vast amount of unlabeled 3D V2X data
to enhance the perception performance. Specifically, multi-agent sensing
information is aggregated to form a holistic view and a novel proxy task is
formulated to reconstruct the LiDAR point clouds across multiple connected
agents to better reason multi-agent spatial correlations. Besides, we develop a
V2X bird-eye-view (BEV) guided masking strategy which effectively allows the
model to pay attention to 3D features across heterogeneous V2X agents (i.e.,
vehicles and infrastructure) in the BEV space. Noticeably, such a masking
strategy effectively pretrains the 3D encoder with a multi-agent LiDAR point
cloud reconstruction objective and is compatible with mainstream cooperative
perception backbones. Our approach, validated through extensive experiments on
representative datasets (i.e., V2X-Real, V2V4Real, and OPV2V) and multiple
state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods (i.e., AttFuse, F-Cooper, and
V2X-ViT), leads to a performance boost across all V2X settings. Notably, CooPre
achieves a 4% mAP improvement on V2X-Real dataset and surpasses baseline
performance using only 50% of the training data, highlighting its data
efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's powerful performance
in cross-domain transferability and robustness under challenging scenarios. The

*Sihyun Yu, Sangkyung Kwak, Huiwon Jang, Jongheon Jeong, Jonathan Huang, Jinwoo Shin, Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces REPA, a regularization method aligning noisy input representations in diffusion models with clean image representations from pretrained encoders, improving training efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quality of representations in diffusion models lags behind self-supervised methods, and training efficiency is a bottleneck. External visual representations can aid learning.

Method: REPA aligns noisy input hidden states with clean image representations from pretrained encoders, applied to diffusion and flow-based transformers like DiTs and SiTs.

Result: REPA speeds up SiT training by 17.5×, achieves FID=1.42 with classifier-free guidance, and matches performance in fewer steps.

Conclusion: REPA significantly enhances training efficiency and generation quality in diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative)
diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside
the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those
learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main
bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in
effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made
easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather
than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We
study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called
REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input
hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained
from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple
strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based
transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT
training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without
classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than
400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the
guidance interval.

*Yu Wang, Xiaofei Zhou, Yichen Wang, Geyuan Zhang, Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel jailbreak attack framework, Multi-Modal Linkage (MML), is proposed to exploit vulnerabilities in advanced VLMs like GPT-4o by using an encryption-decryption process and 'evil alignment' to bypass ethical safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing jailbreak methods against state-of-the-art VLMs, which fail due to over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealth.

Method: MML employs an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities and uses 'evil alignment' to covertly align outputs with malicious intent, framed as a video game scenario.

Result: MML achieves high success rates: 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench, and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset.

Conclusion: MML is an effective jailbreak attack framework for advanced VLMs, demonstrating high success rates and stealth.

Abstract: With the significant advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
concerns about their potential misuse and abuse have grown rapidly. Previous
studies have highlighted VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where
carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates
ethical and legal standards. However, existing methods struggle against
state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o, due to the over-exposure of harmful content
and lack of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we propose a novel
jailbreak attack framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing
inspiration from cryptography, MML utilizes an encryption-decryption process
across text and image modalities to mitigate over-exposure of malicious
information. To align the model's output with malicious intent covertly, MML
employs a technique called "evil alignment", framing the attack within a video
game production scenario. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MML's
effectiveness. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of
97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wangyu-ovo/MML.

### [180] [Click-Calib: A Robust Extrinsic Calibration Method for Surround-View Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01557)
*Lihao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click-Calib is a pattern-free, user-friendly method for offline SVS extrinsic calibration, achieving high accuracy at both short and long distances by optimizing camera poses through keypoint reprojection errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional offline extrinsic calibration methods for SVS are cumbersome, rely on physical patterns, and perform poorly in distant zones.

Method: Click-Calib requires users to click keypoints on the ground in natural scenes, optimizing camera poses by minimizing reprojection errors. It supports single-frame and multiple-frame modes.

Result: Evaluations show Click-Calib outperforms baseline methods in accuracy and robustness on in-house and public datasets.

Conclusion: Click-Calib offers a simpler, more accurate, and robust solution for SVS extrinsic calibration, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Surround-View System (SVS) is an essential component in Advanced Driver
Assistance System (ADAS) and requires precise calibrations. However,
conventional offline extrinsic calibration methods are cumbersome and
time-consuming as they rely heavily on physical patterns. Additionally, these
methods primarily focus on short-range areas surrounding the vehicle, resulting
in lower calibration quality in more distant zones. To address these
limitations, we propose Click-Calib, a pattern-free approach for offline SVS
extrinsic calibration. Without requiring any special setup, the user only needs
to click a few keypoints on the ground in natural scenes. Unlike other offline
calibration approaches, Click-Calib optimizes camera poses over a wide range by
minimizing reprojection distance errors of keypoints, thereby achieving
accurate calibrations at both short and long distances. Furthermore,
Click-Calib supports both single-frame and multiple-frame modes, with the
latter offering even better results. Evaluations on our in-house dataset and
the public WoodScape dataset demonstrate its superior accuracy and robustness
compared to baseline methods. Code is available at

*Robyn Larracy, Angkoon Phinyomark, Ala Salehi, Eve MacDonald, Saeed Kazemi, Shikder Shafiul Bashar, Aaron Tabor, Erik Scheme*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, a large-scale plantar pressure dataset for gait analysis, addressing the lack of publicly available data in this field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional gait analysis relies on video and motion capture, but plantar pressure sensing offers deeper insights. Lack of large datasets limits research in this area.

Method: The dataset includes high-resolution plantar pressure data from 150 individuals, collected using a pressure-sensing walkway, with varied walking speeds and footwear conditions.

Result: The dataset contains over 200,000 footsteps, enabling advancements in biometric gait recognition and biomechanics research.

Conclusion: UNB StepUP-P150 sets a new benchmark for plantar pressure-based gait analysis, opening new research opportunities.

Abstract: Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which
are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioral traits.
Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports,
and rehabilitation. While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture,
advances in plantar pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights into
gait. However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due to
the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets. To address this, we introduce
the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset: a footStep database for gait analysis and
recognition using Underfoot Pressure, including data from 150 individuals. This
dataset comprises high-resolution plantar pressure data (4 sensors per
cm-squared) collected using a 1.2m by 3.6m pressure-sensing walkway. It
contains over 200,000 footsteps from participants walking with various speeds
(preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and slow) and footwear conditions (barefoot,
standard shoes, and two personal shoes), supporting advancements in biometric
gait recognition and presenting new research opportunities in biomechanics and
deep learning. UNB StepUP-P150 establishes a new benchmark for plantar
pressure-based gait analysis and recognition.

*Yixuan Li, Changli Tang, Jimin Zhuang, Yudong Yang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F-16 is a multimodal LLM for high-frame-rate video understanding, outperforming SOTA models by capturing dynamic visual features at 16 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video understanding rely on low-frame-rate static features, causing visual information loss.

Method: F-16 increases frame rate to 16 FPS, compresses visual tokens per 1-second clip, and introduces efficient decoding for low-frame-rate inference.

Result: F-16 achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks like Video-MME and TemporalBench, excelling in spatiotemporal tasks.

Conclusion: Higher frame rates enhance video understanding, offering an alternative to scaling model size or data. F-16's code and models will be released.

Abstract: Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with
multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on
static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of
frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information
loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for
high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and
compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures
dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental
results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video
understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving
video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both
general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and
TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks,
including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football,
gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like
GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method
for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without
requiring model retraining. We will release the source code, model checkpoints,

TL;DR: The paper introduces Source-Free Document Layout Analysis (SFDLA) to adapt pre-trained models to unlabeled target domains without source data, addressing privacy and resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLA methods require large-scale source data and target labels, limiting real-world applicability in sensitive domains.

Method: Proposes DLAdapter, a framework for source-free adaptation, and establishes the first SFDLA benchmark.

Result: DLAdapter improves performance by +4.21% over source-only baseline and +2.26% over existing methods.

Conclusion: This work advances source-free document understanding and provides resources for future research.

Abstract: Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is a fundamental task in document
understanding. However, existing DLA and adaptation methods often require
access to large-scale source data and target labels. This requirements severely
limiting their real-world applicability, particularly in privacy-sensitive and
resource-constrained domains, such as financial statements, medical records,
and proprietary business documents. According to our observation, directly
transferring source-domain fine-tuned models on target domains often results in
a significant performance drop (Avg. -32.64%). In this work, we introduce
Source-Free Document Layout Analysis (SFDLA), aiming for adapting a pre-trained
source DLA models to an unlabeled target domain, without access to any source
data. To address this challenge, we establish the first SFDLA benchmark,
covering three major DLA datasets for geometric- and content-aware adaptation.
Furthermore, we propose Document Layout Analysis Adapter (DLAdapter), a novel
framework that is designed to improve source-free adaptation across document
domains. Our method achieves a +4.21% improvement over the source-only baseline
and a +2.26% gain over existing source-free methods from PubLayNet to
DocLayNet. We believe this work will inspire the DLA community to further
investigate source-free document understanding. To support future research of
the community, the benchmark, models, and code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: RefChartQA integrates Chart Question Answering with visual grounding to improve model accuracy and reliability by identifying visual elements in charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart understanding methods lack explicit identification of visual elements supporting predictions, limiting detailed understanding and reliability.

Method: Introduces RefChartQA benchmark, instruction-tunes 5 VLMs, and evaluates spatial awareness via grounding. TinyChart's token-merging module enhances feature fusion.

Result: Incorporating spatial awareness improves response accuracy by over 15%, reduces hallucinations, and enhances reliability.

Conclusion: RefChartQA bridges the gap in chart understanding, offering a benchmark and open-source tools for community advancement.

Abstract: Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have increasingly emphasized document
visual grounding to achieve better human-computer interaction, accessibility,
and detailed understanding. However, its application to visualizations such as
charts remains under-explored due to the inherent complexity of interleaved
visual-numerical relationships in chart images. Existing chart understanding
methods primarily focus on answering questions without explicitly identifying
the visual elements that support their predictions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce RefChartQA, a novel benchmark that integrates Chart Question
Answering (ChartQA) with visual grounding, enabling models to refer elements at
multiple granularities within chart images. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation by instruction-tuning 5 state-of-the-art VLMs across
different categories. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating spatial
awareness via grounding improves response accuracy by over 15%, reducing
hallucinations, and improving model reliability. Additionally, we identify key
factors influencing text-spatial alignment, such as architectural improvements
in TinyChart, which leverages a token-merging module for enhanced feature
fusion. Our dataset is open-sourced for community development and further
advancements. All models and code will be publicly available at

*Zuying Xie, Changtao Miao, Ajian Liu, Jiabao Guo, Feng Li, Dan Guo, Yunfeng Diao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUEDE proposes a unified framework for detecting both physical and digital face attacks by combining shared and routed experts, leveraging CLIP for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face recognition systems struggle with detecting diverse attack types (physical and digital) due to their inherent differences, lacking a unified solution.

Method: SUEDE uses a shared expert for common features and routed experts for specific attack types, integrating CLIP for prior visual knowledge.

Result: SUEDE outperforms state-of-the-art unified detection methods in detecting face attacks.

Conclusion: SUEDE effectively bridges the gap between physical and digital attack detection, offering a robust and unified solution.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to physical attacks (e.g., printed
photos) and digital threats (e.g., DeepFake), which are currently being studied
as independent visual tasks, such as Face Anti-Spoofing and Forgery Detection.
The inherent differences among various attack types present significant
challenges in identifying a common feature space, making it difficult to
develop a unified framework for detecting data from both attack modalities
simultaneously. Inspired by the efficacy of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in
learning across diverse domains, we explore utilizing multiple experts to learn
the distinct features of various attack types. However, the feature
distributions of physical and digital attacks overlap and differ. This suggests
that relying solely on distinct experts to learn the unique features of each
attack type may overlook shared knowledge between them. To address these
issues, we propose SUEDE, the Shared Unified Experts for Physical-Digital Face
Attack Detection Enhancement. SUEDE combines a shared expert (always activated)
to capture common features for both attack types and multiple routed experts
(selectively activated) for specific attack types. Further, we integrate CLIP
as the base network to ensure the shared expert benefits from prior visual
knowledge and align visual-text representations in a unified space. Extensive
results demonstrate SUEDE achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art unified detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAM is a large, diverse dataset for studying typographic attacks on multimodal models, revealing performance degradation and influencing factors like training data and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for typographic attacks are limited, hindering research on vulnerabilities in multimodal models.

Method: Introduces SCAM, a dataset of 1,162 real-world typographic attack images, and benchmarks Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on it.

Result: Typographic attacks degrade VLM performance; susceptibility depends on training data, architecture, and vision encoder choice. Larger LLM backbones help mitigate vulnerability.

Conclusion: SCAM provides resources and insights for robust multimodal AI research, with synthetic attacks resembling real-world ones. Dataset and code are publicly released.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in
multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text
is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and
diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we
introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic
attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object
categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly
degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture
influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that
typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language
Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we
demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten)
attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive
resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and
trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced
in this paper along with the code for evaluations at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance anomaly detection and localization in SAR imagery by replacing the unbounded Mahalanobis distance with the bounded cosine similarity metric.

Method: Introduces ACE detection statistic within the PaDiM framework, evaluating performance via AUROC at image and pixel levels.

Result: Improved anomaly detection and localization across multiple SAR datasets.

Conclusion: ACE offers bounded anomaly scores, enhancing SAR imagery analysis; code is publicly available.

Abstract: This work presents a new approach to anomaly detection and localization in
synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR), expanding upon the existing patch
distribution modeling framework (PaDiM). We introduce the adaptive cosine
estimator (ACE) detection statistic. PaDiM uses the Mahalanobis distance at
inference, an unbounded metric. ACE instead uses the cosine similarity metric,
providing bounded anomaly detection scores. The proposed method is evaluated
across multiple SAR datasets, with performance metrics including the area under
the receiver operating curve (AUROC) at the image and pixel level, aiming for
increased performance in anomaly detection and localization of SAR imagery. The

TL;DR: A novel data augmentation technique combines style augmentation and random erasing by replacing image subregions with style-transferred patches, improving robustness and reducing overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance data augmentation by integrating style transfer and random erasing for better training robustness and performance.

Method: Apply random style transfer to images, then replace selected areas with style-transferred patches, compatible with various style transfer algorithms.

Result: Achieves superior performance and faster convergence compared to previous style augmentation methods.

Conclusion: The technique effectively improves training robustness and reduces overfitting, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that combines
the advantages of style augmentation and random erasing by selectively
replacing image subregions with style-transferred patches. Our approach first
applies a random style transfer to training images, then randomly substitutes
selected areas of these images with patches derived from the style-transferred
versions. This method is able to seamlessly accommodate a wide range of
existing style transfer algorithms and can be readily integrated into diverse
data augmentation pipelines. By incorporating our strategy, the training
process becomes more robust and less prone to overfitting. Comparative
experiments demonstrate that, relative to previous style augmentation methods,
our technique achieves superior performance and faster convergence.

*Xiao Zhang, Lu Zou, Tao Lu, Yuan Yao, Zhangjin Huang, Guoping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INKL-Pose is a novel framework for category-level object pose estimation, using instance-adaptive keypoint learning and local-to-global geometric aggregation to handle complex geometries and shape deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with intra-class variations, especially for objects with complex geometries or non-canonical shapes.

Method: Predicts keypoints with an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detector, refines them using local and global feature aggregators (including bidirectional Mamba), and employs surface and separation losses for keypoint optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D datasets with 16.7M parameters and 36 FPS.

Conclusion: INKL-Pose effectively addresses generalization challenges in category-level pose estimation, offering high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and size of
previously unseen instances from predefined categories, requiring strong
generalization across diverse object instances. Although many previous methods
attempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances
exhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes.
To address this issue, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object pose
estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with
local-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our method first predicts
semantically consistent and geometrically informative keypoints using an
Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detector, then refines them: (1) a Local Keypoint
Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global Keypoint
Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural consistency. To
enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a simple yet effective
Feature Sequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while
constructing backward feature sequence. Additionally, we design a surface loss
and a separation loss to encourage uniform coverage and spatial diversity in
keypoint distribution. The resulting keypoints are mapped to a canonical space
for 6D pose and size regression. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25, REAL275,
and HouseCat6D show that INKL-Pose achieves state-of-the-art performance with
16.7M parameters and runs at 36 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPU.

TL;DR: VideoHallu is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities in synthetic videos, showing gaps in commonsense and physics reasoning. Post-training with GRPO improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic video generation often violates commonsense and physics, necessitating robust abnormality detectors for MLLMs.

Method: VideoHallu benchmark with 3,000+ QA pairs from synthetic videos, testing MLLMs on alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. Evaluated SOTA models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Result: SOTA MLLMs struggle with basic physics and commonsense in synthetic videos despite strong performance on real-world benchmarks. GRPO post-training improves detection.

Conclusion: Targeted training (e.g., GRPO) enhances MLLMs' understanding of commonsense and physics in synthetic videos, addressing hallucination issues.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation has gained significant attention for its realism
and broad applications, but remains prone to violations of common sense and
physical laws. This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that
understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this,
we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from
synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with
expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities
of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are
perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors.
VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples
across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA
MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and
VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world
benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic
physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show
that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using
curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive
commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves
MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of
targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical
laws. Our code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel keypoint detector/descriptor using deformable transformers to improve feature detection under challenging conditions like viewpoint changes. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods and introduces new benchmarks for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust feature detection under challenging scenarios (e.g., viewpoint changes) remains unresolved in structure-from-motion and SLAM. Existing methods fail to capture long-range visual cues.

Method: RDD leverages deformable transformers to capture global context and geometric invariance via deformable self-attention mechanisms. It reduces search space complexity and focuses on key locations.

Result: RDD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sparse matching and enables semi-dense matching. It is evaluated on new benchmarks for large viewpoint/scale variations and Air-to-Ground scenarios.

Conclusion: RDD addresses limitations in feature detection by modeling global context and geometric invariance, demonstrating superior performance and introducing new evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection
and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint
changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have
identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric
transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in
long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel
and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer,
which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable
self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention
focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and
modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground
dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our
proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description
methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To
ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one
emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an
Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining
popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance gap between SNN-based and ANN-based transformer architectures, particularly in feature extraction from different image scales, motivates the development of MSVIT.

Method: Proposes MSVIT with multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enhance spiking attention blocks in SNN-based transformers.

Result: MSVIT outperforms existing SNN-based models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SNN-transformer architectures.

Conclusion: MSVIT successfully bridges the performance gap in SNN-based transformers, offering an energy-efficient and high-performance solution.

Abstract: The combination of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Vision Transformer
architectures has garnered significant attention due to their potential for
energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, a
substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based
transformer architectures. While existing methods propose spiking
self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall
architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively
extracting features from different image scales. In this paper, we address this
issue and propose MSVIT. This novel spike-driven Transformer architecture
firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enhance the capabilities
of spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main
datasets. The experimental results show that MSVIT outperforms existing
SNN-based models, positioning itself as a state-of-the-art solution among
SNN-transformer architectures. The codes are available at

*Shufan Li, Konstantinos Kallidromitis, Hritik Bansal, Akash Gokul, Yusuke Kato, Kazuki Kozuka, Jason Kuen, Zhe Lin, Kai-Wei Chang, Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaViDa introduces a family of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based on discrete diffusion models (DMs), offering faster inference and controllable generation, outperforming autoregressive VLMs like LLaVA in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive VLMs lack fast inference and controllable generation, while DMs show promise but are underexplored for multimodal tasks.

Method: LaViDa integrates DMs with a vision encoder, using techniques like complementary masking, prefix KV cache, and timestep shifting for training and inference.

Result: LaViDa outperforms AR VLMs in benchmarks (e.g., +4.1 CIDEr on COCO captioning, 1.92x speedup) and excels in bidirectional tasks (+59% on Constrained Poem Completion).

Conclusion: LaViDa is a competitive alternative to AR VLMs, combining the advantages of DMs for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks
requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for
VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining
outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR)
VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs)
offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference
and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling.
While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks
is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build
LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the
combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges
encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking
for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep
shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves
competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such
as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible
speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO
captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x
speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained
Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR
VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

*Hong-Hanh Nguyen-Le, Van-Tuan Tran, Dinh-Thuc Nguyen, Nhien-An Le-Khac*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes T²A, a test-time adaptation method for Deepfake detectors to handle postprocessing and distribution shifts, improving resilience and generalization without needing source data or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors degrade in performance due to postprocessing and distribution shifts in real-world scenarios.

Method: T²A uses Uncertainty-aware Negative Learning, Uncertain Sample Prioritization, and Gradients Masking to adapt models during inference.

Result: T²A outperforms existing TTA methods, enhancing detector resilience and generalization.

Conclusion: T²A is a novel, effective approach for improving Deepfake detector adaptability in challenging environments.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in
real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated
from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution
shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure
generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance
degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think
Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation
method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without
requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable
the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative
Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as
commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce
an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to
improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning
objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation
capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared
to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances
the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference. Code is

*Jérémy Scanvic, Quentin Barthélemy, Julián Tachella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for understanding equivariance of normalization layers in CNNs to shifts and translations, validated empirically with ResNet-18 and ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on normalization layers in designing translation-equivariant CNNs, which can improve physical accuracy in scientific computing.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze equivariance of normalization layers, tested empirically using ResNet-18 and ImageNet feature maps.

Result: Theoretical predictions on equivariance conditions were consistent with empirical findings.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into normalization layer equivariance, aiding the design of more accurate translation-equivariant CNNs.

Abstract: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant
to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to
benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more
physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling
layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is
dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical
framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to
discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of
the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and
ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are
consistent with our predictions.

*Nick Jiang, Amil Dravid, Alexei Efros, Yossi Gandelsman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores high-norm tokens in Vision Transformers, identifies neurons causing noisy attention, and proposes a training-free fix using untrained tokens to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the issue of high-norm tokens causing noisy attention maps in Vision Transformers without retraining models.

Method: Shifts high-norm activations from identified neurons to an untrained token, mimicking register tokens' effects without retraining.

Result: Cleaner attention/feature maps, improved downstream task performance, and comparable results to register-trained models.

Conclusion: Test-time registers offer a training-free solution for pre-trained models, enhancing interpretability and performance.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

TL;DR: A novel dual-branch adversarial neural network eliminates calibration needs for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition by disentangling features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming inter-subject variability in EMG signals without time-consuming calibration for practical deployment.

Method: End-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network for feature disentanglement into pattern-specific and subject-specific components.

Result: Outperforms baselines in cross-subject scenarios, enabling robust recognition for unseen users.

Conclusion: Proposes a calibration-free approach with potential for broader applications like biometric systems.

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant
challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode
placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on
subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach
that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world
deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration
requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject
generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network
that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification
by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific
components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern
recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific
components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric
identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various
baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new
perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration
and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as
task-independent biometric systems.

Conclusion: The open-sourced pipeline and tools provide scalable solutions for AV training challenges.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI
systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is
especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role
in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we

TL;DR: Vireo is a novel single-stage framework for Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS), unifying OVSS and DGSS. It leverages frozen Visual Foundation Models and Depth VFMs, introducing GeoText Prompts, CMPE, and DOV-VEH for robust performance across unseen domains and categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OV-DGSS addresses the need for pixel-level segmentation of unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving in adverse conditions.

Method: Vireo integrates frozen Visual Foundation Models and Depth VFMs, with three key components: GeoText Prompts for modality alignment, CMPE for faster convergence, and DOV-VEH for feature fusion.

Result: Vireo achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition.

Conclusion: Vireo offers a unified, scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse environments, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in
semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS
aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining
robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world
scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo,
a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS
and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation
Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract
domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and
textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1)
GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and
progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior
Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and
stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding
Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust
prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the
effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art
performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain
generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable
solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoCA is a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, improving generalizability and adaptation without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying E2E autonomous driving across domains, where existing methods like LLMs lack guaranteed performance and incur high retraining costs.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution over tokens encoding vehicle information, using Gaussian processes to learn basis tokens and trajectories for diverse scenarios.

Result: RoCA enhances the base E2E model's generalizability and outperforms direct finetuning in domain adaptation, validated across various scenarios.

Conclusion: RoCA achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation, offering a practical solution for cross-domain E2E autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAC is a new framework for generating adversarial CAPTCHAs using text prompts and LLMs, improving diversity and attack flexibility. BP-UAC, a variant, excels in black-box scenarios with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to DNN attacks, and existing adversarial methods often distort images or lack flexibility without initial inputs.

Method: UAC uses text prompts and LLMs for CAPTCHA generation. Targeted attacks employ EDICT for quality, while BP-UAC uses multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for untargeted attacks.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates, producing CAPTCHAs that fool both humans and DNNs.

Conclusion: UAC and BP-UAC offer robust solutions for adversarial CAPTCHA generation, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are dynamic in space and time, posing challenges for world modeling. The paper aims to capture these dynamics for better agent behavior.

Method: The authors create STRIDE, a dataset with interconnected observation, state, and action nodes. They use TARDIS, a transformer-based model, to integrate spatial and temporal dynamics.

Result: The model performs well in tasks like photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, and georeferencing, showcasing enhanced embodied reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach advances generalist agents by improving their understanding and manipulation of spatio-temporal environments. Resources are publicly available.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

TL;DR: SwiftWRF introduces Gaussian splatting to wireless radiance field modeling, enabling fast and accurate reconstruction for tasks like localization and sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for wireless radiance field modeling are either inaccurate or computationally expensive, limiting real-time deployment.

Method: SwiftWRF uses deformable 2D Gaussian splatting and CUDA-accelerated rasterization for efficient WRF reconstruction, with a lightweight MLP for mobility-induced variations.

Result: SwiftWRF achieves 500x faster reconstruction than state-of-the-art methods while improving signal quality, validated on real-world and synthetic scenes.

Conclusion: SwiftWRF offers a scalable and efficient solution for wireless radiance field modeling, with applications in AoA and RSSI prediction.

Abstract: Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern
communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and
channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or
physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong
scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve
reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their
reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries
hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in
modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF
reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian
splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under
single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated
rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP
to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing
mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the
efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor
scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster
than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its
signal quality. The project page is https://evan-sudo.github.io/swiftwrf/.

TL;DR: Pro-AD improves unsupervised anomaly detection by expanding prototypes and using a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder to enhance normal information aggregation and reconstruction, while preventing anomaly reconstruction via a Prototype-based Constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods aggregate insufficient normal information, and increasing prototypes risks reconstructing anomalies (Soft Identity Mapping problem).

Method: Introduces expanded prototypes and a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder for comprehensive normal information aggregation and reconstruction. Adds a Prototype-based Constraint to prevent anomaly reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pro-AD effectively addresses prototype limitations and outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection
utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates
insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction.
However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well
reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft
Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these
issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly
detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable
prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we
employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the
normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via
prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more
comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image
features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its
contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive
prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well
reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention
mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within
the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further
improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness
for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss method for patent image retrieval, leveraging the Locarno International Classification system to improve relevance and efficiency, especially for low-parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent images are complex and current retrieval systems ignore hierarchical relationships like those in the LIC system, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that assigns multiple positive pairs with varying similarity scores based on LIC taxonomy.

Result: Experimental results on the DeepPatent2 dataset show improved retrieval performance, particularly for low-parameter models.

Conclusion: The method enhances patent image retrieval by incorporating hierarchical relationships and is efficient for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections
and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information
retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their
technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient
fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents'
hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International
Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing")
into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent
designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive
loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the
retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the
retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,
which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments
with limited hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with long videos due to fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling, while existing RAG methods are inefficient or lose information.

Method: AdaVideoRAG uses a lightweight intent classifier to adapt retrieval granularity and an Omni-Knowledge Indexing module to build hierarchical databases from multimodal data.

Result: Experiments show improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video understanding, with seamless integration into MLLMs.

Conclusion: AdaVideoRAG introduces a new adaptive retrieval paradigm for video analysis, with open-sourced code available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to
fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling. Existing
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval
strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss
for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework
that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a
lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing
module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual
features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across
tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video
understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG
establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis. Codes will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of masked-based autoregressive models for video generation is under-explored, and existing methods face challenges like high computational costs and long sequence modeling.

Method: Proposes VideoMAR with temporal causality, spatial bi-directionality, next-frame diffusion loss, curriculum learning, progressive resolution training, and 3D rotary embeddings.

Result: Outperforms Cosmos I2V on VBench-I2V with fewer parameters (9.3%), training data (0.5%), and GPU resources (0.2%).

Conclusion: VideoMAR is a concise, efficient, and innovative approach to video generation, replicating language model capabilities while reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image
generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video
generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR},
a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with
continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked
generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality
as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion
loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost
and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial
issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning
and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature
strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore,
VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video
generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous
temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the
capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the
VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos
I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data
($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

Method: Based on YOLOv11, the framework introduces six fusion modes, a P3 mid-fusion strategy, and MCF for fine-tuning, optimizing feature fusion and reducing redundancy.

Result: The framework outperforms on datasets like LLVIP and FLIR, with MCF boosting YOLOv11's mAP by 3.41%-5.65%, reaching 47.61% on FLIR.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-RGBT effectively addresses multispectral fusion challenges, enhancing adaptability and robustness, validated by superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection, which integrates information from multiple
bands, can enhance detection accuracy and environmental adaptability, holding
great application potential across various fields. Although existing methods
have made progress in cross-modal interaction, low-light conditions, and model
lightweight, there are still challenges like the lack of a unified single-stage
framework, difficulty in balancing performance and fusion strategy, and
unreasonable modality weight allocation. To address these, based on the YOLOv11
framework, we present YOLOv11-RGBT, a new comprehensive multimodal object
detection framework. We designed six multispectral fusion modes and
successfully applied them to models from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12 and RT-DETR. After
reevaluating the importance of the two modalities, we proposed a P3 mid-fusion
strategy and multispectral controllable fine-tuning (MCF) strategy for
multispectral models. These improvements optimize feature fusion, reduce
redundancy and mismatches, and boost overall model performance. Experiments
show our framework excels on three major open-source multispectral object
detection datasets, like LLVIP and FLIR. Particularly, the multispectral
controllable fine-tuning strategy significantly enhanced model adaptability and
robustness. On the FLIR dataset, it consistently improved YOLOv11 models' mAP
by 3.41%-5.65%, reaching a maximum of 47.61%, verifying the framework and
strategies' effectiveness. The code is available at:

### [210] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15207)
*Mohamad A. Hady, Siyi Hu, Mahardhika Pratama, Jimmy Cao, Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) for autonomous Earth Observation (EO) mission planning in multi-satellite systems, addressing challenges like resource constraints and decentralized coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LEO satellites has improved EO missions, but autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a challenge, requiring advanced solutions beyond traditional optimization.

Method: The study models single-satellite operations and extends to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks (PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, HAPPO), evaluating performance in a near-realistic simulation.

Result: MARL effectively balances imaging and resource management, handling non-stationarity and reward interdependency in decentralized coordination.

Conclusion: The findings support autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for policy learning in decentralized EO missions.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

*Maxwell J. Jacobson, Corey J. Maley, Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM integrates symbolic reasoning with neural generation for context-sensitive decisions in multi-modal data, outperforming classical logic and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic logic systems lack nuance and grounding in multi-modal environments, while neural networks lack interpretable reasoning structures. CALM bridges this gap.

Method: CALM uses domain trees for predicates, refining analog truth values via neural networks and symbolic reasoning to ensure constraint satisfaction.

Result: CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy in object placement tasks, surpassing classical logic (86.3%) and LLMs (59.4%), and aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: CALM combines logic precision with neural multi-modal processing, paving the way for robust, interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

*Yao Zhang, Chenyang Lin, Shijie Tang, Haokun Chen, Shijie Zhou, Yunpu Ma, Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmAgentic is a fully automated framework for generating and optimizing agentic systems, outperforming baselines by 261.8% on the TravelPlanner benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack full autonomy, limiting adaptability and scalability. SwarmAgentic addresses this by enabling from-scratch agent generation and self-optimization.

Method: SwarmAgentic uses language-driven exploration and evolves candidate systems via feedback-guided updates, inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving a +261.8% improvement on the TravelPlanner benchmark, demonstrating effectiveness in unconstrained tasks.

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic advances scalable and autonomous agentic system design, combining swarm intelligence with automated multi-agent generation.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is

*Tristan Tomilin, Luka van den Boogaard, Samuel Garcin, Bram Grooten, Meng Fang, Mykola Pechenizkiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEAL is a new benchmark for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by enabling GPU acceleration for longer task sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for continual learning (CL) in multi-agent settings are limited by CPU-based computation, restricting task sequence length and scalability.

Method: MEAL uses JAX for GPU acceleration, allowing continual learning across 100 tasks on a standard desktop PC. It evaluates the performance of combined CL and MARL methods.

Result: Naive combinations of CL and MARL methods perform well in simple environments but fail in complex settings requiring coordination and adaptation.

Conclusion: MEAL identifies key architectural and algorithmic features necessary for effective CMARL, providing a scalable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T-PPO, a novel extension of PPO, improves training efficiency for reasoning LLMs by optimizing policy updates and response generation, achieving up to 2.5x faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's inefficiency due to on-policy nature and long response times in LLMs motivates the need for a more efficient method like T-PPO.

Method: T-PPO introduces Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) and a mechanism for independent optimization of policy and value models, reducing redundant computations.

Result: T-PPO achieves up to 2.5x training efficiency improvement and outperforms competitors on AIME 2024 with a 32B model.

Conclusion: T-PPO effectively addresses PPO's inefficiencies, enhancing LLM training for reasoning tasks without compromising convergence.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

### [215] [HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial Optimization Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15196)
*Xianliang Yang, Ling Zhang, Haolong Qian, Lei Song, Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeurAgenix is a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework using LLMs to evolve and select heuristics for combinatorial optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic designs rely on manual expertise and lack generalization across diverse problem instances.

Method: HeurAgenix evolves heuristics using LLMs and dynamically selects the best heuristic for each problem state, with options for a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model. A dual-reward mechanism fine-tunes the selector.

Result: HeurAgenix outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or exceeds specialized solvers on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust performance and flexibility, with potential for broader applications in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

*Jiahao You, Ziye Jia, Chao Dong, Qihui Wu, Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cooperative MEC framework using UAVs and vessels to address computational offloading and resource allocation challenges in MIoT, leveraging Lyapunov optimization and a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of MIoT demands efficient computation offloading and resource allocation, complicated by uncertain maritime tasks.

Method: A cooperative MEC framework is introduced, combining Lyapunov optimization for task unpredictability and a Markov game approach with a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic for solving small-scale optimization problems.

Result: Simulations confirm the framework's effectiveness in minimizing execution time for computational offloading and resource allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenges of uncertain MIoT tasks through UAV-vessel cooperation and advanced optimization techniques.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

*Ruoyu Wang, Xinshu Li, Chen Wang, Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), a method that improves visual navigation by modeling causal relationships in sequential data, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods process historical observations without considering internal causal structures, limiting performance. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes CAN with a Causal Understanding Module to enhance environmental understanding by leveraging causality in sequential data.

Result: CAN consistently outperforms baselines in various tasks and environments, with gains attributed to the Causal Understanding Module.

Conclusion: CAN's causal approach generalizes well in Reinforcement and Supervised Learning, offering performance improvements without added computational cost.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-based Planning Agent (LPA) to automate and streamline Failure Analysis (FA) tasks by integrating AI models into cohesive workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FA is complex and knowledge-intensive; integrating AI can automate tasks like anomaly detection, case retrieval, and report generation, but orchestrating multiple AI models is challenging.

Method: The LPA combines LLMs with advanced planning and external tools to autonomously process queries, retrieve data, and generate responses.

Result: The LPA is effective and reliable in supporting FA tasks, as demonstrated by evaluation results.

Conclusion: The LPA successfully addresses the challenge of integrating AI models into FA workflows, enhancing efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Embodied Web Agents, a novel AI paradigm integrating physical embodiment and web-scale reasoning, addressing tasks requiring both. It presents a simulation platform and benchmark for assessing such cross-domain intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are siloed, limiting their ability to solve tasks requiring integrated physical and digital intelligence, like cooking or navigation with dynamic data.

Method: Developed the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a simulation platform integrating 3D environments with web interfaces, and created a benchmark for diverse tasks.

Result: Revealed performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and humans, highlighting challenges and opportunities in cross-domain intelligence.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for AI agents that bridge embodiment and web reasoning, with public datasets and tools for further research.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

### [220] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear, Rachel Guo, Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for constructing natural language state representations for LLM agents in repeated games, highlighting dependencies of agent behavior on state representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the ad hoc and inconsistent approaches to encoding game history in LLM agents, which obscure the impact of state representation and limit study comparability.

Method: Characterizes state representation along three axes: action informativeness, reward informativeness, and prompting style (natural language compression). Applied to a dynamic selfish routing game.

Result: Summarized history, regret information, and limited action details lead to behavior closer to equilibrium predictions and stable play. Other representations cause deviations or instability.

Conclusion: State representation significantly impacts LLM agent behavior, with specific representations aligning better with game theory predictions and stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

*James Weichert, Daniel Dunlap, Mohammed Farghally, Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI Policy Module for CS curricula to address gaps in preparing students for AI ethics and policy challenges, showing positive results in student attitudes and confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CS curricula lack preparation for AI practitioners to integrate ethical principles and policy into AI design, necessitating educational interventions.

Method: Developed and piloted an AI Policy Module (2.0) with pre- and post-module surveys to evaluate student attitudes and confidence.

Result: Students reported increased concern about AI ethics and greater confidence in discussing AI regulation post-module.

Conclusion: The AI Policy Module and its AI Regulation Assignment effectively bridge the gap between technical AI education and ethical/policy awareness.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical meta-representation called the Structural Temporal Graph (STG) for analyzing music at multiple granularities. It proposes a method to derive structural summaries of music corpora using combinatorial optimization and simulated annealing, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To holistically analyze music compositions at multiple structural levels, from fine-grained melody to high-level form, a unified hierarchical representation is needed.

Method: The STG represents hierarchical musical features and temporal relationships. The method involves simulated annealing for structural distance measurement and SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing to derive corpus centroids.

Result: Experiments confirm that structural distance differentiates music pieces and derived centroids accurately represent their corpora.

Conclusion: The STG and proposed method effectively capture and summarize hierarchical musical structures, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of
structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze
music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a
unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the
structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data
structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical
features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable
a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music
corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first
applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between
two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the
formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over
structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid
STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our
approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately
differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately
structurally characterize their corpora.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiency in large reasoning models (LRMs) due to overthinking and proposes two methods to enhance efficiency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often generate verbose and redundant content, increasing inference costs and reducing efficiency. The study aims to uncover and exploit their inherent potential for concise reasoning.

Method: Two methods are proposed: Efficiency Steering (a training-free activation technique) and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL (a reinforcement learning framework rewarding concise correct solutions).

Result: Experiments on seven LRM backbones show significant reduction in reasoning length while maintaining or improving task performance.

Conclusion: Efficiency in reasoning can be improved by leveraging existing model capabilities, guided by lightweight methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

*Jin Liu, Xingchen Xu, Xi Nan, Yongjun Li, Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based AI like ChatGPT reshapes labor markets by displacing jobs and intensifying competition, especially in programming tasks, due to skill-transition effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how general-purpose AI impacts labor markets, focusing on displacement and skill transitions.

Method: Analysis of data from an online labor platform to observe demand, supply, and freelancer competition in LLM-aligned submarkets.

Result: Pronounced displacement and supply contraction in LLM-aligned submarkets, with heightened competition, especially in programming tasks. High-skilled freelancers drive skill transitions.

Conclusion: General-purpose AI displaces jobs and induces skill transitions, with implications for policymakers, platforms, and workers.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT,
demonstrate zero-shot learning capabilities across a wide range of downstream
tasks. Owing to their general-purpose nature and potential to augment or even
automate job functions, these systems are poised to reshape labor market
dynamics. However, predicting their precise impact \textit{a priori} is
challenging, given AI's simultaneous effects on both demand and supply, as well
as the strategic responses of market participants. Leveraging an extensive
dataset from a leading online labor platform, we document a pronounced
displacement effect and an overall contraction in submarkets where required
skills closely align with core LLM functionalities. Although demand and supply
both decline, the reduction in supply is comparatively smaller, thereby
intensifying competition among freelancers. Notably, further analysis shows
that this heightened competition is especially pronounced in
programming-intensive submarkets. This pattern is attributed to
skill-transition effects: by lowering the human-capital barrier to programming,
ChatGPT enables incumbent freelancers to enter programming tasks. Moreover,
these transitions are not homogeneous, with high-skilled freelancers
contributing disproportionately to the shift. Our findings illuminate the
multifaceted impacts of general-purpose AI on labor markets, highlighting not
only the displacement of certain occupations but also the inducement of skill
transitions within the labor supply. These insights offer practical
implications for policymakers, platform operators, and workers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite SSL's success in computer vision, its application to HTR is scattered, leaving key methodologies like Spatial Context-based SSL unexplored.

Method: The work adapts and optimizes Spatial Context-based SSL for HTR, leveraging unique features of handwritten text.

Result: Experiments show advancements in SSL for HTR across benchmark cases.

Conclusion: The proposed workflows enhance SSL's effectiveness for HTR, addressing its inherent variability and contextual needs.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a relevant problem in computer vision,
and implies unique challenges owing to its inherent variability and the rich
contextualization required for its interpretation. Despite the success of
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in computer vision, its application to HTR has
been rather scattered, leaving key SSL methodologies unexplored. This work
focuses on one of them, namely Spatial Context-based SSL. We investigate how
this family of approaches can be adapted and optimized for HTR and propose new
workflows that leverage the unique features of handwritten text. Our
experiments demonstrate that the methods considered lead to advancements in the
state-of-the-art of SSL for HTR in a number of benchmark cases.

*Mustafa F Abdelwahed, Joan Espasa, Alice Toniolo, Ian P. Gent*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to diverse planning using an n-dimensional grid for expressive diversity modeling, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diverse planning methods limit diversity measures and lack explainability, prompting a need for more expressive and customizable models.

Method: Proposes a grid-based representation for diversity and a toolkit called Behaviour Planning, implemented via planning-as-satisfiability.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the new method outperforms current diverse planning in generating diverse plans and supports broader planning categories.

Conclusion: The approach advances diverse planning by enabling customizable diversity models and expanding applicability beyond classical planning.

Abstract: Diverse planning approaches are utilised in real-world applications like risk
management, automated streamed data analysis, and malware detection. The
current diverse planning formulations encode the diversity model as a distance
function, which is computational inexpensive when comparing two plans. However,
such modelling approach limits what can be encoded as measure of diversity, as
well as the ability to explain why two plans are different. This paper
introduces a novel approach to the diverse planning problem, allowing for more
expressive modelling of diversity using a n-dimensional grid representation,
where each dimension corresponds to a user-defined feature. Furthermore, we
present a novel toolkit that generates diverse plans based on such customisable
diversity models, called \emph{Behaviour Planning}. We provide an
implementation for behaviour planning using planning-as-satisfiability. An
empirical evaluation of our implementation shows that behaviour planning
significantly outperforms the current diverse planning method in generating
diverse plans measured on our new customisable diversity models. Our
implementation is the first diverse planning approach to support planning
categories beyond classical planning, such as over-subscription and numerical
planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new ontology versioning (OV) approach using ontology matching (OM) techniques, introducing a unified OM4OV pipeline and a cross-reference mechanism to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic nature of the Semantic Web and the growing size of ontologies necessitate efficient OV methods, as current approaches are overwhelmed by manual errors.

Method: The paper introduces the OM4OV pipeline, reformulates OV tasks from an OM perspective, and proposes the cross-reference mechanism to optimize performance.

Result: The OM4OV pipeline and cross-reference mechanism are validated using OAEI datasets, showing improved OV performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of OM techniques for OV tasks, noting that some false mappings detected by OV systems may not be incorrect.

Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary
to capture time-varying information, particularly for widely used ontologies.
Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial
component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and
accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In
this paper, we propose yet another approach to performing OV using existing
ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV
pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation and
measurement for OV tasks. Building upon the prior alignment(s) from OM, we
propose a pipeline optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR)
mechanism to enhance overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the
OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in the OV tested originating
from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also
discuss insights into OM used for OV tasks, where some false mappings detected
by OV systems are not actually untrue.

### [228] [Optimal Transport for Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13061)
*Adrian Ciotinga, YooJung Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits (PCs) is introduced, enabling tractable computation of a Wasserstein-type distance between PC-represented distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack the ability to compute Wasserstein distances between distributions represented by PCs, despite tractable divergence computations for certain PC classes.

Method: Proposes a Wasserstein-type distance with coupling measures restricted to PCs, solved via small linear programs, and derives tractability conditions. Also retrieves optimal transport plans and minimizes empirical Wasserstein distance through iterative parameter estimation.

Result: Develops an algorithm for tractable Wasserstein distance computation and optimal transport plan retrieval, with empirical validation.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently computes Wasserstein distances for PCs, enabling practical applications in probabilistic modeling.

Abstract: We introduce a novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits
(PCs). While it has been shown recently that divergences between distributions
represented as certain classes of PCs can be computed tractably, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no existing approach to compute the Wasserstein
distance between probability distributions given by PCs. We propose a
Wasserstein-type distance that restricts the coupling measure of the associated
optimal transport problem to be a probabilistic circuit. We then develop an
algorithm for computing this distance by solving a series of small linear
programs and derive the circuit conditions under which this is tractable.
Furthermore, we show that we can easily retrieve the optimal transport plan
between the PCs from the solutions to these linear programs. Lastly, we study
the empirical Wasserstein distance between a PC and a dataset, and show that we
can estimate the PC parameters to minimize this distance through an efficient
iterative algorithm.

### [229] [Learning Strategic Language Agents in the Werewolf Game with Iterative Latent Space Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04686)
*Zelai Xu, Wanjun Gu, Chao Yu, Yi Wu, Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LSPO combines game-theoretic methods with LLM fine-tuning to improve strategic language agents for games like Werewolf.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with strategic language games due to intrinsic bias and limited exploration of text action space.

Method: LSPO maps utterances to a latent strategy space, applies CFR for policy optimization, and fine-tunes LLMs with DPO.

Result: LSPO agents outperform existing ones in Werewolf, showing improved strategic reasoning and language communication.

Conclusion: LSPO effectively enhances LLM agents for strategic language games by iteratively refining strategy and language alignment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various domains like open-ended conversation and multi-step
decision-making. However, it remains challenging for these agents to solve
strategic language games, such as Werewolf, which demand both strategic
decision-making and free-form language interactions. Existing LLM agents often
suffer from intrinsic bias in their action distributions and limited
exploration of the unbounded text action space, resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Space Policy
Optimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that combines game-theoretic
methods with LLM fine-tuning to build strategic language agents. LSPO leverages
the observation that while the language space is combinatorially large, the
underlying strategy space is relatively compact. We first map free-form
utterances into a finite latent strategy space, yielding an abstracted
extensive-form game. Then we apply game-theoretic methods like Counterfactual
Regret Minimization (CFR) to optimize the policy in the latent space. Finally,
we fine-tune the LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with the
learned policy. By iteratively alternating between these steps, our LSPO agents
progressively enhance both strategic reasoning and language communication.
Experiment on the Werewolf game shows that our agents iteratively expand the
strategy space with improving performance and outperform existing Werewolf
agents, underscoring their effectiveness in free-form language games with
strategic interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KOCO-SMC is an integrated exact solver for Satisfiability Modulo Counting (SMC) that improves efficiency by tracking probabilistic bounds early, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMC solvers are slow due to back-and-forth invocations of SAT and probabilistic inference solvers.

Method: KOCO-SMC integrates exact solving with early probabilistic inference estimation using partial variable assignments.

Result: KOCO-SMC finds exact solutions faster than existing approximate and exact SMC solvers.

Conclusion: KOCO-SMC offers a more efficient solution for exact SMC problems, enhancing performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Counting (SMC) is a recently proposed general language
to reason about problems integrating statistical and symbolic Artificial
Intelligence. An SMC problem is an extended SAT problem in which the truth
values of a few Boolean variables are determined by probabilistic inference.
Approximate solvers may return solutions that violate constraints. Directly
integrating available SAT solvers and probabilistic inference solvers gives
exact solutions but results in slow performance because of many back-and-forth
invocations of both solvers. We propose KOCO-SMC, an integrated exact SMC
solver that efficiently tracks lower and upper bounds in the probabilistic
inference process. It enhances computational efficiency by enabling early
estimation of probabilistic inference using only partial variable assignments,
whereas existing methods require full variable assignments. In the experiment,
we compare KOCO-SMC with currently available approximate and exact SMC solvers
on large-scale datasets and real-world applications. The proposed KOCO-SMC
finds exact solutions with much less time.

*Jinghan Zhang, Xiting Wang, Fengran Mo, Yeyang Zhou, Wanfu Gao, Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Entro-duction dynamically adjusts exploration depth in multi-step reasoning using entropy metrics, balancing accuracy and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for depth adjustment in reasoning tasks are costly and inflexible.

Method: Uses output entropy and variance entropy to monitor uncertainty, dynamically adjusting depth (deepen, expand, or stop).

Result: Effective across four benchmark datasets, improving reasoning accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Conclusion: Entro-duction offers a flexible, cost-effective solution for optimizing multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-step processes via large language models (LLMs) have proven effective
for solving complex reasoning tasks. However, the depth of exploration of the
reasoning procedure can significantly affect the task performance. Existing
methods to automatically decide the depth often lead to high cost and a lack of
flexibility. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration
Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the
exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output
entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two features to capture the
model's uncertainty of the current step and the fluctuation of uncertainty
across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed entropy changes, the
LLM selects whether to deepen, expand, or stop exploration according to the
probability, which facilitates the trade-off between the reasoning accuracy and
exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of Entro-duction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToxiMol is introduced as the first benchmark task for MLLMs focused on molecular toxicity repair, with a standardized dataset and automated evaluation framework (ToxiEval). Current MLLMs show potential but face challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity is a major cause of drug development failure, yet molecular toxicity repair lacks systematic definition or benchmarking.

Method: ToxiMol includes a dataset of 560 toxic molecules, a prompt annotation pipeline, and ToxiEval for automated evaluation. Nearly 30 MLLMs are assessed.

Result: Current MLLMs show promise in toxicity understanding and molecule editing but still face significant challenges.

Conclusion: ToxiMol provides a foundation for advancing MLLMs in toxicity repair, highlighting both potential and areas for improvement.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: The paper critiques data-driven modeling in AI-driven patient care, advocating for a purpose-driven approach grounded in clinical theory and sociotechnical realities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential shortcomings of repurposing real-world patient datasets for machine learning, which may lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care.

Method: Reflects on the history of data analysis, proposes integrating systems thinking and clinical domain theory, and suggests a purpose-driven ML paradigm.

Result: Highlights the need to consider both data generation (upstream) and automation objectives (downstream) for better AI system development.

Conclusion: A purpose-driven approach offers new methodological opportunities and promises improved AI automation in patient care.

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining
ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing
of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always
represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to
undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data
analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we
envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could
complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric
outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is
grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world
operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing
patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data
generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This
purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological
opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

TL;DR: NordDRG-AI-Benchmark is the first open benchmark for evaluating LLMs in hospital funding via DRG logic, featuring multilingual diagnosis and procedure tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for LLMs in clinical coding and decision support at the hospital funding layer, focusing on DRG reimbursement logic.

Method: The benchmark includes definition tables, expert manuals, and a prompt pack with 14 CaseMix tasks to evaluate LLMs on code lookup, cross-table inference, and multilingual terminology.

Result: Five LLMs were tested; OpenAI's model scored 9/9, GPT-4o and o4-mini-high scored 7/9, while Gemini models scored lower (5/9 and 3/9).

Conclusion: NordDRG-AI-Benchmark reveals domain-specific LLM strengths/weaknesses, providing a reproducible baseline for trustworthy automation in hospital funding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are already being piloted for clinical coding
and decision support. However, until now, no open benchmark has targeted the
hospital funding layer where Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) determine
reimbursement across many countries. We release NordDRG-AI-Benchmark, the first
public test-bed that captures a complete DRG rule set and evaluates an LLM's
ability to reason over multilingual diagnosis, procedure, and tariff logic.
  The benchmark bundles three classes of artefacts: (i) definition tables with
20 interlinked tables covering DRG logic, ICD and NCSP codes, age/sex splits,
and country flags; (ii) expert manuals and changelog templates describing real
governance workflows; and (iii) a prompt pack of 14 CaseMix tasks that span
code lookup, cross-table inference, multilingual terminology, and
quality-assurance audits.
  All artefacts are available at:
https://github.com/longshoreforrest/norddrg-ai-benchmark
  A baseline demonstration shows that five state-of-the-art LLMs perform very
differently on the nine automatically verifiable tasks: o3 (OpenAI) scores 9
out of 9, GPT-4o and o4-mini-high score 7 out of 9, while Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash solve only 5 out of 9 and 3 out of 9, respectively. These
results confirm that NordDRG-AI-Benchmark highlights domain-specific strengths
and weaknesses that remain hidden in generic LLM benchmarks, offering a
reproducible baseline for research on trustworthy automation in hospital
funding.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Passive acoustic monitoring uses ARUs to record wildlife sounds, requiring automated processing for large datasets. pycnet-audio provides a workflow using PNW-Cnet to detect vocalizations of 80+ species and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient processing of large acoustic datasets due to impractical manual review.

Method: Deploy ARUs for extended periods, then process data using pycnet-audio and PNW-Cnet for automated detection.

Result: PNW-Cnet detects vocalizations of ~80 species and various noise types, aiding wildlife research.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio offers a practical solution for automated acoustic data processing in wildlife monitoring.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

TL;DR: This study benchmarks Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net for speech enhancement, highlighting their strengths in noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker feature retention, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in comparative performance evaluation of deep learning models for speech enhancement, balancing noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation.

Method: Benchmarking three models (Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, U-Net) on diverse datasets (SpEAR, VPQAD, Clarkson) to evaluate their performance in noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker feature retention.

Result: U-Net excels in noise suppression, CMGAN in perceptual quality, and Wave-U-Net in speaker feature retention, demonstrating trade-offs between these attributes.

Conclusion: Advanced methods can optimize trade-offs in speech enhancement, benefiting applications like voice biometrics, forensic audio, and telecommunication in noisy environments.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face limitations with Braille and audio recordings, needing a more accessible solution.

Method: Implemented an OCR-based system using LabVIEW for accurate and cost-effective speech synthesis.

Result: The system provides a reliable and user-friendly way to convert text to speech.

Conclusion: The OCR-based speech synthesis system effectively addresses accessibility challenges for the visually impaired.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,
reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition
(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SonicVerse is a multi-task music captioning model that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection, improving caption quality and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich music databases and advance music AI research by generating detailed captions that reflect both low-level acoustic and high-level musical attributes.

Method: Uses a projection-based architecture to transform audio into language tokens while detecting music features via auxiliary heads, enhancing captioning input.

Result: Incorporating music features improves caption quality and detail, enabling rich descriptions for both short and long music pieces.

Conclusion: SonicVerse effectively combines multi-task learning with music feature detection to produce high-quality, detailed music captions.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of music source separation on automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) using Whisper, achieving state-of-the-art results without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALT is challenging due to musical interference, and the effect of source separation on ALT performance is unexplored.

Method: Evaluates Whisper on original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems, proposing concatenation for short-form and a vocal activity detection algorithm for long-form tasks.

Result: Achieves reduced Word Error Rate (WER) and state-of-the-art performance on Jam-ALT benchmark. Introduces MUSDB-ALT dataset.

Conclusion: Source separation improves ALT performance, and the proposed methods enhance Whisper's accuracy for both short and long-form tasks.

Abstract: Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) remains a challenging task in the field
of music information retrieval, despite great advances in automatic speech
recognition (ASR) brought about by transformer-based architectures in recent
years. One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering
audio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent
advances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of
high-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.
However, the effect of source separation has not been systematically
investigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work
examines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a
state-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on
original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and
long-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation
method that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For
long-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity
detector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction
in WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT
benchmark, without any training or fine-tuning. We also publish MUSDB-ALT, the
first dataset of long-form lyric transcripts following the Jam-ALT guidelines
for which vocal stems are publicly available.

*Teysir Baoueb, Xiaoyu Bie, Xi Wang, Gaël Richard*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for instrument editing in text-to-music diffusion models without additional training or speed compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling text-to-music generation for specific outcomes is challenging due to sensitivity to text prompts.

Method: Leverages a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model, using an intermediate timestep identified by an instrument classifier to balance content preservation and timbre change.

Result: The method successfully edits instruments in audio tracks while preserving underlying content.

Conclusion: The approach enables precise instrument editing without model retraining or speed trade-offs.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

*Junyan Jiang, Daniel Chin, Liwei Lin, Xuanjie Liu, Gus Xia*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm using pretrained LMs and lightweight adapters for tasks like chord recognition and melody generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many music AI models rely on human-defined labels, but annotations like chords can be expressed within music itself, enabling unified understanding and generation tasks.

Method: Utilize pretrained LMs for reference and target sequences, linking them via lightweight adapters for parameter efficiency.

Result: Superior performance in tasks like chord recognition, melody generation, and drum track generation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively unifies diverse music tasks with high performance, and resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Many music AI models learn a map between music content and human-defined
labels. However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed
within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This
observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and
conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be
unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we
propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music
tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model
(LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two
LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody
generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are
publicly available.

### [242] [TTSOps: A Closed-Loop Corpus Optimization Framework for Training Multi-Speaker TTS Models from Dark Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15614)
*Kentaro Seki, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Takaaki Saeki, Hiroshi Saruwatari*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: TTSOps is an automated framework for building multi-speaker TTS systems from noisy web-scale data, outperforming traditional methods in naturalness and speaker diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional TTS systems require high-quality curated data, limiting scalability and diversity. TTSOps addresses this by leveraging noisy 'dark data' and modern TTS robustness.

Method: TTSOps integrates automated data collection, dynamic data cleansing, and evaluation-in-the-loop selection using predicted MOS, optimizing both data and model in a closed-loop.

Result: Experiments on Japanese YouTube data show TTSOps surpasses traditional methods in speech naturalness and speaker diversity.

Conclusion: TTSOps effectively leverages noisy data for scalable, diverse TTS systems, demonstrating superior performance over conventional approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents TTSOps, a fully automated closed-loop framework for
constructing multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems from noisy, uncurated
web-scale speech data, often referred to as ``dark data,'' such as online
videos. Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with
high acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits
scalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent
studies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they
often overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS
models to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality
yet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a
data-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)
automated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic
selection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)
evaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean
opinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.
Furthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a
closed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data
cleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive
experiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms
conventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and
speaker diversity of synthesized speech.

*Pedro Lima Louro, Hugo Redinho, Ricardo Santos, Ricardo Malheiro, Renato Panda, Rui Pedro Paiva*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MERGE, three new datasets for Music Emotion Recognition (MER), addressing the lack of quality bimodal (audio-lyrics) databases. It validates their viability with experiments, achieving an 81.74% F1-score for bimodal classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of public, sizable, and quality-controlled bimodal databases for MER has hindered progress in bimodal audio-lyrics systems.

Method: The authors created MERGE datasets using a semi-automatic approach and conducted experiments using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. Fixed train-validation-test splits were also proposed.

Result: The datasets were validated, with the best result being an 81.74% F1-score for bimodal classification.

Conclusion: The proposed MERGE datasets are viable and provide a benchmark for future research in bimodal MER systems.

Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in
recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning,
and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to
bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a lack of public,
sizable and quality-controlled bimodal databases has hampered the development
and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three
new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively referred to
as MERGE, which were created using a semi-automatic approach. To
comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for
benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature
engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. Additionally,
we propose and validate fixed train-validation-test splits. The obtained
results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best
overall result of 81.74\% F1-score for bimodal classification.

*Alba Márquez-Rodríguez, Miguel Ángel Mohedano-Munoz, Manuel J. Marín-Jiménez, Eduardo Santamaría-García, Giulia Bastianelli, Pedro Jordano, Irene Mendoza*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A multi-stage pipeline combining a Bird Song Detector and local classification models improves bird species identification in Doñana National Park, outperforming general-purpose tools like BirdNET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Passive Acoustic Monitoring generates large audio volumes, but general tools like BirdNET have biases and limitations at local scales. Accurate bird species identification is crucial for conservation in threatened ecosystems.

Method: Deployed AudioMoth recorders in three habitats, manually annotated audio, and developed a pipeline: Bird Song Detector to isolate vocalizations, followed by local-scale classification models.

Result: The pipeline improved species identification, with fine-tuned BirdNET outperforming the baseline. Detecting bird vocalizations before classification enhanced model performance.

Conclusion: Adapting general tools to local ecological challenges is effective. Automated bird detection aids conservation by monitoring ecosystem health and supporting biodiversity efforts.

Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring is a key tool for biodiversity conservation, but
the large volumes of unsupervised audio it generates present major challenges
for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning offers promising
solutions. BirdNET, a widely used bird identification model, has shown success
in many study systems but is limited at local scale due to biases in its
training data, which focus on specific locations and target sounds rather than
entire soundscapes. A key challenge in bird species identification is that many
recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations,
complicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed
a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in
Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We
deployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and
manually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments
spanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird
vocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were
classified using custom models trained at the local scale. Applying the Bird
Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all
models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were
detected. Specifically, the combination of detector and fine-tuned BirdNET
outperformed the baseline without detection. This approach demonstrates the
effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with local classification
models. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools to
specific ecological challenges. Automatically detecting bird species helps
track the health of this threatened ecosystem, given birds sensitivity to
environmental change, and supports conservation planning to reduce biodiversity
loss.

*Haven Kim, Zachary Novack, Weihan Xu, Julian McAuley, Hao-Wen Dong*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset for film music generation, and a video adapter to enhance music models, improving performance in film production contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current music generation systems lack integration of filmmaking nuances like visual content and emotional tone, due to missing comprehensive datasets.

Method: Introduces OSSL, a dataset of movie clips with soundtracks and mood annotations, and a video adapter for a transformer-based music model.

Result: The approach improves MusicGen-Medium in distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre.

Conclusion: OSSL and the video adapter effectively address the gap in film music generation, enhancing model performance for film production.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in
film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of
real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as
visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music
for a scene. This limitation primarily stems from the absence of comprehensive
datasets that integrate these elements. To address this gap, we introduce Open
Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public
domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality
soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models
on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances
an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based
conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach
effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of
distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and
genre. The dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, enhances clinical decision-making by enabling interactive dialogues between physicians and LLMs, improving diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making is complex and prone to biases; current LLM usage lacks dynamic interaction, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes MedSyn, a framework for multi-step, interactive dialogues between physicians and LLMs, allowing dynamic exchanges and refinement of decisions.

Result: Open-source LLMs show promise as physician assistants in simulated interactions, suggesting real-world potential.

Conclusion: Future work will validate MedSyn's effectiveness in real physician interactions, focusing on diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

### [247] [Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14781)
*Corentin Delacour, M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb, Joao P. Hespanha, Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 2D parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) to improve sampling in constrained Ising problems, eliminating the need to tune penalty strengths and achieving faster mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical implementations of Ising models for optimization are hindered by soft constraints, which either slow down mixing or fail to enforce feasibility.

Method: A two-dimensional extension of parallel tempering (PT) is proposed, adding a second dimension of replicas to interpolate penalty strengths, ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Result: 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing (KL divergence decays as O(1/t)) and provides orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT in tests like graph sparsification.

Conclusion: 2D-PT is broadly applicable to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

*Yao Zhang, Hewei Gao, Haokun Chen, Weiguo Li, Yunpu Ma, Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNano is a federated learning framework for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that centralizes the LLM on the server and uses lightweight client modules (NanoEdge) to reduce storage and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed data and privacy constraints, while existing FL methods are impractical for large-scale MLLMs.

Method: FedNano centralizes the LLM on the server and introduces NanoEdge, a lightweight module with modality-specific encoders and low-rank adapters, reducing client-side storage and communication overhead.

Result: FedNano reduces client-side storage by 95% and communication overhead to 0.01% of model parameters, outperforming prior FL baselines.

Conclusion: FedNano bridges the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares two AI approaches: DeepSeek-V3, a large-scale LLM, and NetraAI, a framework for stability and interpretability in small clinical datasets. NetraAI combines dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient subgroups, achieving high accuracy with minimal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and stable AI in clinical settings, especially with small datasets, by leveraging dynamical systems and evolutionary learning.

Method: NetraAI uses contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to embed features in a metric space and identify stable subgroups. An LLM Strategist acts as a meta-evolutionary layer for guidance.

Result: NetraAI transformed weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers (AUC ~0.50-0.68 to high accuracy) in case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer) using few features.

Conclusion: NetraAI bridges dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, offering explainable and adaptive AI for clinical discovery, aligning with modern reasoning paradigms like JEPA.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ETS, a framework combining EEG and eye-tracking for open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG-based methods struggle with noise and variability in open-vocabulary scenarios, limiting their practical use.

Method: ETS integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data for text generation and sentiment classification.

Result: Superior performance in BLEU/Rouge scores for text generation and 10% F1 improvement in sentiment classification.

Conclusion: ETS shows promise for high-performance open-vocabulary EEG-to-text systems across diverse subjects and data sources.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MARL methods fail against coordinated adversarial attacks in cooperative scenarios.

Method: Introduces Wolfpack attack (targets initial and assisting agents) and WALL framework (trains robust policies).

Result: Wolfpack attack is highly disruptive; WALL significantly improves robustness.

Conclusion: WALL effectively counters Wolfpack attacks, enhancing MARL robustness.

Abstract: Traditional robust methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) often
struggle against coordinated adversarial attacks in cooperative scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose the Wolfpack Adversarial Attack framework,
inspired by wolf hunting strategies, which targets an initial agent and its
assisting agents to disrupt cooperation. Additionally, we introduce the
Wolfpack-Adversarial Learning for MARL (WALL) framework, which trains robust
MARL policies to defend against the proposed Wolfpack attack by fostering
systemwide collaboration. Experimental results underscore the devastating
impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements
achieved by WALL. Our code is available at

*Emre Yilmaz, Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transfer learning method using convolutional neural networks (ConvNet) is proposed to predict onflow parameters (angle of attack and speed) from surface pressure data, addressing challenges like sensor faults and data distribution changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional direct measurements of onflow parameters face challenges like sensor faults. Data-driven models need real-time adaptability for practical applications like wind tunnel monitoring.

Method: Offline training of a ConvNet model, freezing most weights, and retraining selected layers for transfer learning. Demonstrated with CFD data for domain and task adaptation.

Result: Successful adaptation to changing data distributions, domain extension, and task updates, but limited effectiveness with noisy data.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for real-time parameter prediction but requires refinement for noisy data scenarios.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

*Haobo Li, Eunseo Jung, Zixin Chen, Zhaowei Wang, Yueya Wang, Huamin Qu, Alexis Kai Hon Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIPE is a lightweight method embedding physical info into VLMs for multimodal time series forecasting, improving alignment and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect visual data in time series, missing key physical info like geospatial context in satellite imagery.

Method: PIPE uses physics-informed positional indexing and variant-frequency encoding to embed physical and sequential info.

Result: PIPE achieves SOTA performance, e.g., 12% better typhoon intensity forecasting.

Conclusion: PIPE effectively integrates physical info into VLMs, enhancing multimodal forecasting.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

*Funing Li, Yuan Tian, Ruben Noortwyck, Jifeng Zhou, Liming Kuang, Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning framework using GNN and Transformer is proposed to optimize retrieval in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous items, minimizing tardiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient, high-density storage systems in logistics is unmet by conventional homogeneous lane storage due to flexibility issues.

Method: A graph-based state representation and a neural network combining GNN (for local topology) and Transformer (for global priorities) are introduced.

Result: The framework outperforms heuristic methods in minimizing retrieval tardiness and adapts to diverse warehouse layouts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses retrieval challenges in multi-deep storage systems, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AZT1D is a high-quality dataset for T1D management, offering detailed patient data (CGM, insulin, carbs, device modes) to advance AI/ML applications in personalized care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited public datasets with comprehensive T1D patient data hinder progress in AI-driven diabetes management.

Method: Collected data from 25 T1D patients on AID systems over 6-8 weeks, including CGM, insulin delivery, carbs, and device modes.

Result: AZT1D provides granular details (e.g., bolus insulin specifics) rarely found in existing datasets.

Conclusion: AZT1D enables AI/ML applications to improve clinical decision-making and individualized T1D care.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [256] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan, Ming Jin, Yuanpeng He, Yuxuan Liang, Yong Deng, Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP) to address recurring concept drift in time series by retaining and utilizing past knowledge, improving prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift causes forgetting of past patterns, reducing prediction accuracy. Existing methods update parameters but may lose knowledge and lack retention mechanisms.

Method: CEP stores forecasters for different concepts, selects the nearest forecaster for test samples, and learns from neighbors. New concepts trigger model evolution, while outdated knowledge is cleared.

Result: CEP effectively retains knowledge of different concepts and significantly improves prediction results in online forecasting with recurring concepts.

Conclusion: CEP is a robust solution for handling recurring concept drift, enhancing prediction accuracy by retaining and utilizing past knowledge.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

*Aditya Ravuri, Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Injecting dropout at inference time in PLMs like ESM2 improves zero-shot performance on ProteinGym without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance zero-shot prediction of protein properties using PLMs without additional training.

Method: Add a dropout layer (0.1 rate) between the featurizer and transformer during inference, averaging outputs like Monte-Carlo dropout.

Result: Improved zero-shot performance on ProteinGym dataset, even without prior dropout training.

Conclusion: Dropout at inference boosts PLM performance without retraining, suggesting broader applicability.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

### [258] [Assembly of Experts: Linear-time construction of the Chimera LLM variants with emergent and adaptable behaviors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14794)
*Henrik Klagges, Robert Dahlke, Fabian Klemm, Benjamin Merkel, Daniel Klingmann, David A. Reiss, Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Assembly-of-Experts' (AoE), a method to efficiently create child models from Mixture-of-Experts parents by interpolating weights, reducing computational costs while maintaining functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost (10^13-10^15 FLOPs) of pretraining LLMs motivates the development of AoE to leverage existing models more efficiently.

Method: AoE interpolates individual weight tensors from parent models, enabling gradual or sharp trait changes in child models without fine-tuning.

Result: The DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera' model, created using AoE, achieves parent-level intelligence with 40% fewer output tokens and faster speed.

Conclusion: AoE enables efficient, functional child model creation, demonstrating compact reasoning and reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the tradeoff between structured and selective representations in intelligent systems, deriving universal limits on generalization and identification, validated across models from simple ReLU networks to complex vision-language systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental limits of how intelligent systems balance structured (generalizable) and selective (identity-preserving) representations.

Method: Theoretical derivation of closed-form expressions for generalization and identification probabilities, extended to noisy and heterogeneous spaces, and empirical validation using minimal ReLU networks, CNNs, and vision-language models.

Result: Reveals a universal Pareto front for the tradeoff, predicts a sharp 1/n collapse in multi-input capacity, and shows non-monotonic optimal generalization. Empirical results align with theory.

Conclusion: Finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental constraint, shaping representational capacity in both deep networks and biological systems.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve time series forecasting by integrating semantic priors and dynamic temporal encoding while reducing computational complexity.

Method: Uses Mamba selective state space model, semantic index embeddings from pretrained language models, and spline-based KAN for temporal encoding.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba is a versatile and efficient alternative to Transformer-based models for time series forecasting.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

*Bochen Lyu, Xiaojing Zhang, Fangyi Zheng, He Wang, Zheng Wang, Zhanxing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a continuous-time approximation for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, explicitly accounting for discretization error, and applies it to study implicit regularization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete optimization methods and their continuous-time approximations, focusing on the Heavy-Ball momentum method and its discretization error.

Method: Designs a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation with counter terms to explicitly control discretization error.

Result: Provides a continuous-time model for the Heavy-Ball method with arbitrary step-size error control and explores implicit regularization in deep learning.

Conclusion: The work offers new theoretical tools for analyzing optimization methods, supported by numerical experiments, with implications for deep learning.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARC is a framework to analyze prompt sensitivity in Vision Language Models (VLMs), revealing their instability to prompt variations and identifying robust models like InternVL2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs integrate visual and language modalities but may inherit prompt sensitivity from LLMs, necessitating analysis of their stability to prompt variations.

Method: PARC evaluates VLMs using plausible prompt variations, a novel reliability score, and calibration for cross-dataset analysis.

Result: VLMs show sensitivity to language prompts in the vision domain, with InternVL2 models being the most robust. Prompt sensitivity may relate to training data.

Conclusion: PARC provides insights into VLM prompt sensitivity, highlighting robust models and the impact of training data, with code available for further research.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models struggle with frequent zero-demand periods, impacting inventory management in supply chains.

Method: Proposes a Model-Router framework using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers to assign forecasting strategies based on demand patterns.

Result: The InceptionTime router improves accuracy by 11.8% (NWRMSLE) and speeds up inference by 4.67x on the Favorita dataset.

Conclusion: The framework enhances forecasting precision, reducing stockouts and excess inventory, highlighting adaptive AI's role in supply chain optimization.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning while maintaining scalability and plasticity.

Method: Introduces a modular neural network architecture allowing selective combination of previous and internal policies.

Result: Achieves greater knowledge transfer and performance in benchmark tasks compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances scalability, plasticity, and performance in continual learning.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that
naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual
reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective
combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating
the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural
network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed
approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not
sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model to predict body composition variables (ALM, BFP, BMD) using 3D optical images, achieving competitive accuracy despite limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DXA scans for body composition measurement are costly and time-consuming, necessitating a cheaper, faster alternative using 3D optical images and biomarkers.

Method: A $p$-Laplacian regression model and supervised algorithms (SVR, Least Squares SVR) were applied to a dataset of 847 patients, using biomarkers from 3D images.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model achieved errors of ~13% (ALM), ~10% (BMD), and ~20% (BFP) with 10% training data. SVR performed best for ALM/BMD (~8% error), and Least Squares SVR for BFP (~11% error) with 80% training data.

Conclusion: The $p$-Laplacian model is a promising tool for healthcare in data-constrained environments, offering a viable alternative to DXA scans.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of VLMs in detailed visual reasoning, especially under constrained compute resources.

Method: Training smaller models with GRPO, a simple reward structure, simplified tool-calling, and a data mix favoring visually difficult examples.

Result: Improved performance on VQA tasks compared to similarly-sized baseline models.

Conclusion: Combining GRPO, tool use, and strategic data selection enhances VLM performance in detailed visual reasoning.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Motivation: To accelerate HEA discovery by integrating computational and experimental data, addressing challenges like heteroscedastic and incomplete data.

Method: Systematic comparison of four surrogate models on a hybrid dataset of AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA properties.

Result: DGP with ML-based prior outperforms others in capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty.

Conclusion: Advanced surrogate models, especially DGP, enhance predictive accuracy for robust, data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CACTUS, a new ML tool, improves AMD stage classification by addressing data limitations, explainability, and bias, outperforming standard models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data is often incomplete or limited, hindering ML model performance. Early AMD diagnosis is crucial due to lack of treatments, requiring robust classification methods.

Method: CACTUS integrates genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors, offering explainability and flexibility. It identifies key features and reduces bias by filtering irrelevant data.

Result: CACTUS outperforms standard ML models, enhances decision-making, and aligns with medical knowledge by highlighting important features.

Conclusion: CACTUS provides a reliable, transparent solution for AMD classification, aiding clinicians in early diagnosis and reducing biases.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

*Jenni Raitoharju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GRKneg for OC-SVM, improving kernel with negative samples without labels, outperforming standard OC-SVM and binary SVM with few negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address small-scale one-class classification with limited negative samples, enhancing OC-SVM performance.

Method: Introduces GRKneg, improving kernel using negative data without label optimization, comparing with OC-SVM and binary SVM.

Result: GRKneg outperforms standard OC-SVM with RBF kernel and binary SVM when negative samples are scarce.

Conclusion: GRKneg is effective for one-class classification with few negative samples, offering a robust alternative to binary SVM in such cases.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event-driven online VFL framework to address challenges like asynchronous data streaming and non-convex models in non-stationary environments, improving stability and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning in VFL faces challenges due to asynchronous data streaming and non-intersecting feature sets, which prior research overlooked.

Method: An event-driven online VFL framework activates subsets of clients per event, incorporates dynamic local regret (DLR), and analyzes regret under non-convex conditions.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods in stability under non-stationary data and reduces communication and computation costs.

Conclusion: The proposed event-driven framework effectively addresses online VFL challenges, offering practical advantages in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

*Ganyu Wang, Jinjie Fang, Maxwell J. Ying, Bin Gu, Xi Chen, Boyu Wang, Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOne framework optimizes query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning by activating one client per round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked query cost in federated black-box prompt tuning for cloud-based LLMs.

Method: Proposed FedOne, a federated learning strategy activating one client per round for optimal query efficiency.

Result: Significant improvement in query efficiency, aligning with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: FedOne effectively maximizes query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

*Luan Gonçalves Miranda, Pedro Ivo da Cruz, Murilo Bellezoni Loiola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning algorithms to automatically define the threshold for anomaly detection in autoencoders, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoencoders lack a standardized threshold for classifying reconstruction errors, impacting detection performance.

Method: Evaluated three machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, Support Vector Machine) for threshold definition.

Result: The proposed approach aims to enhance anomaly detection by automating threshold selection.

Conclusion: Automating threshold definition with machine learning can improve autoencoder-based anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and characterizes channels in neural network loss landscapes where loss decreases slowly, leading to diverging output weights and equal input weights, forming gated linear units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand special structures in neural network loss landscapes, particularly channels leading to diverging weights and their implications for optimization and model behavior.

Method: Analyzes gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation of these channels, using gradient flow solvers and optimization methods like SGD or ADAM in regression settings.

Result: Gradient-based methods frequently reach these channels, which appear as flat local minima but lead to gated linear units, revealing unexpected computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed understanding of quasi-flat regions in loss landscapes and highlights the emergence of gated linear units as a key insight into neural network optimization.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus for diverse domains, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning, showing nuanced benefits of RL training across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals for general reasoning beyond math and code, and to explore RL's broader applicability.

Method: Developed Guru, a corpus of 92K verifiable examples across six reasoning domains, with domain-specific reward design and filtering. Evaluated RL training effects across domains and released Guru-7B and Guru-32B models.

Result: Guru models achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines by 7.9% and 6.7%. RL training benefits vary by domain, with in-domain training crucial for less pretrained domains.

Conclusion: RL can facilitate genuine skill acquisition in LLMs, especially for domains with limited pretraining exposure. The Guru corpus and models advance general-purpose reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

*Aayush Mishra, Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) to improve error estimation of ML models in unseen test domains by focusing on non-overlapping target regions, outperforming prior DIS² methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate error estimation in unseen domains is critical for safe ML systems. Prior DIS² methods compete in overlapping regions, limiting reliability.

Method: Proposes ODD, which maximizes disagreement only in non-overlapping target domains using domain-classifiers to estimate overlap.

Result: ODD-based bounds outperform DIS² in predicting target performance across benchmarks, improving estimation accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: ODD provides a more reliable and accurate error estimation method for ML models under distribution shifts, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper predicts early MS disability progression using sparse clinical and digital data, showing improved performance with multimodal transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early MS disability prediction is difficult due to disease heterogeneity. This work aims to improve accuracy by integrating digital data with clinical data.

Method: Used tabular and time-series foundation models, a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods on baseline clinical and 12-week digital Floodlight data.

Result: Despite low AUROC (0.63), integrating digital data improved predictions. A transformer with unimodal embeddings performed best, but the multimodal transformer consistently outperformed unimodal models.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches and foundation models show promise for extracting predictive signals from diverse data, improving prognostics for MS and other complex diseases.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

TL;DR: A multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework is proposed to balance fairness and performance, using strategic probing for information gathering and achieving strong results in both offline and online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing system performance in decision-making under limited information about arm rewards.

Method: Introduces a probing framework for information gathering, with a greedy probing algorithm for offline settings (known rewards) and an online algorithm for sublinear regret and fairness.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in fairness and efficiency, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MA-MAB framework effectively balances fairness and performance, with theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

*Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stable CDE state representations improve RL policies for sepsis treatment by addressing training instability and enforcing acuity-aware features, outperforming unstable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of training instability in sequential representations for sepsis treatment and its impact on RL policy performance is overlooked in prior work.

Method: Uses Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) with early stopping/stabilization and acuity-aware correlation regularization (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS).

Result: Stable CDE representations correlate with clinical scores and enable superior RL policies (WIS return > 0.9), while unstable ones fail (WIS return ~ 0).

Conclusion: Training stability is critical for CDEs in clinical RL, with stable methods capturing meaningful patterns and improving policy performance.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim, Sumiran Singh Thakur, Su Min Park, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT-GO improves supervised fine-tuning by grouping tokens based on importance and optimizing with a weighted loss, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT methods treat all tokens uniformly, ignoring critical task-specific information in subsets of tokens.

Method: SFT-GO groups tokens by importance, using a weighted combination of worst-group loss and cross-entropy loss.

Result: Models trained with SFT-GO outperform baselines across benchmarks, datasets, and base models.

Conclusion: SFT-GO is robust and effective, improving learning dynamics and performance in LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reinforcement learning methods for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization are too costly in time and computation.

Method: SPG extends the base model with temporary modules to generate state-action trajectories in a single forward pass, unlike traditional policy gradient methods.

Result: SPG improves model performance by +0.2∼7% across diverse datasets (ImageNet, COCO, GLUE, SQuAD, SUPERB) with low computational costs.

Conclusion: SPG is a practical, efficient alternative for hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating consistent gains and industrial applicability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

*Ethan Mulle, Wei Kang, Qi Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A progressive framework (HiPreNets) is introduced to train high-precision neural networks by refining residuals sequentially, improving accuracy beyond traditional MSE-focused methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training highly accurate neural networks is challenging due to non-convex optimization and hyperparameter tuning, with traditional methods often neglecting critical $L^{\infty}$ error.

Method: The framework refines staged training by sequentially learning prediction residuals using additional networks, optimizing loss functions, parameter choices, and adaptive data sampling.

Result: Validated on benchmark problems, the framework demonstrates improved accuracy by addressing residuals and optimizing training strategies.

Conclusion: HiPreNets offers a scalable solution for high-precision neural network training, outperforming traditional methods in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents, identifying high hallucination rates under scene-task inconsistencies and proposing insights for robust planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify hallucinations in LLMs when grounded in physical environments, especially under infeasible tasks.

Method: Constructed a hallucination probing set from an existing benchmark, evaluated 12 models across two simulation environments.

Result: Models showed reasoning but failed to resolve inconsistencies, with hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations in handling infeasible tasks and provides actionable insights for developing more reliable planning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model for robust traffic data imputation by combining low-rank tensor algebra and deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing traffic data due to sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps hinders reliable traffic modeling.

Method: NCPF integrates CP decomposition into neural architecture with learnable embeddings and hierarchical feature fusion, using Hadamard products and MLPs for spatiotemporal coupling.

Result: NCPF outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines on six urban traffic datasets.

Conclusion: NCPF unifies interpretable factor analysis with neural expressive power, supporting advanced transportation systems.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper surveys machine unlearning verification methods, proposing a taxonomy and analyzing their strengths, limitations, and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of unified taxonomy and systematic evaluation for verifying machine unlearning operations.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing techniques into behavioral and parametric verification, examining representative methods in each.

Result: Identifies strengths, limitations, and vulnerabilities of current verification methods.

Conclusion: Highlights open problems to guide future research toward robust and efficient unlearning verification.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

*Bing Liu, Chengcheng Zhao, Li Chai, Peng Cheng, Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ImprovDML, a decentralized DML framework that balances high model accuracy, privacy preservation, and Byzantine resilience using resilient vector consensus and Gaussian noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between Byzantine resilience, privacy, and model accuracy in distributed machine learning.

Method: Uses resilient vector consensus for aggregation and multivariate Gaussian noise for privacy, with convergence guarantees and error bounds.

Result: Achieves tighter error bounds and better privacy-accuracy trade-off than existing methods, validated by simulations.

Conclusion: ImprovDML effectively combines Byzantine resilience and privacy without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

*Yee Hin Chong, Peng Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoKA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method combining Kronecker-product factorization and SVD-driven initialization, outperforming existing methods with fewer parameters and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of full fine-tuning and limitations of existing PEFT methods like latency, suboptimal convergence, or fixed rank choices.

Method: Combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and dynamic rank selection.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance with 0.99M parameters (25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA) and faster convergence.

Conclusion: SoKA is a robust and efficient PEFT method for large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SKIL introduces a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework to infer interpretable skill sets and parameterize policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills, outperforming traditional discrete models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify animal behavior by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive assumptions, failing to reflect the dynamic recombination of motor primitives.

Method: SKIL leverages representation learning on transition probabilities to infer latent skill sets and parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. It is validated on grid worlds, labyrinths, and animal videos.

Result: SKIL identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond traditional models.

Conclusion: SKIL provides a principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ML techniques' accuracy for the 1D Poisson equation, highlighting the importance of data function space for generalization. It provides theoretical bounds, empirical validation, and a new interpretability lens, proposing a cross-validation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously assess ML's quantitative accuracy in scientific applications, focusing on the 1D Poisson equation, and address generalization challenges.

Method: Analyzes training dynamics, derives optimal parameters, and tests generalization bounds for white-box and black-box models, including deep linear models and neural networks.

Result: Generalization to the true equation isn't guaranteed; different models show opposing behaviors. Green's function representations can be extracted from black-box models.

Conclusion: Proposes a cross-validation technique for generalization in physical systems and suggests the Poisson equation as a benchmark for future ML methods.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

*Bihe Zhao, Pratyush Maini, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate synthetic held-out data for Dataset Inference (DI), enabling detection of unauthorized training data use without requiring in-distribution private sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DI methods need in-distribution held-out data, which is rarely available, limiting their practicality. The paper aims to overcome this by synthetically generating such data.

Method: The approach involves (1) training a data generator on a suffix-based completion task to create diverse synthetic data and (2) post-hoc calibration to align synthetic and real data likelihoods.

Result: Experiments show the synthetic data enables high-confidence DI detection of original training sets with low false positives.

Conclusion: The method empowers copyright owners to verify data usage and is reliable for real-world applications.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

*Mélanie Cambus, Darya Melnyk, Tijana Milentijević, Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of federated learning against Byzantine behavior, highlighting a tradeoff between averaging and validity conditions. It provides theoretical bounds on centroid approximation and introduces a new algorithm with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether federated learning is resilient to Byzantine faults and to understand the tradeoff between averaging and validity conditions in distributed settings.

Method: Theoretical analysis of centroid approximation under validity conditions, introduction of a new algorithm for convex validity, and empirical evaluations in federated learning settings.

Result: Lower and upper bounds on centroid approximation are established, and a new algorithm achieves tight approximation under convex validity. Empirical results validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the challenges of Byzantine robustness in federated learning, provides tight theoretical bounds, and offers practical solutions with empirical support.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

*Chuan Li, Shunyu Zhao, Vincent Gauthier, Hassine Moungla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOVA-PATBM is a geo-computational framework for optimizing EV charging infrastructure, balancing urban, suburban, and rural needs with scalable, data-rich methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable infrastructure planning tools to address the diverse requirements of metropolitan, suburban, and rural areas for EV charging networks.

Method: Uses a hierarchical H3 grid, graph neural network centrality, Voronoi tessellation, and M/M/c queue modeling to optimize charger placement and capacity.

Result: In Georgia, USA, it improved coverage, reduced travel distance for low-income residents, and ensured power constraints, while remaining scalable.

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM bridges academic optimization and practical infrastructure policy with its integrated, multi-resolution approach.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sparse rewards and conflicting constraints in multi-target drug discovery.

Method: Integrates Seq2Seq VAE into iterative loops, balancing diversity, quality, and affinity, with strategic chemical filters.

Result: Generated diverse pan-inhibitor candidates for coronavirus proteases, improving exploration of chemical space.

Conclusion: Provides a generalizable framework for efficient multi-objective drug design.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a credit risk management framework for 3PL-led SCF in CBEC, using QRGMM and DeepFM for risk assessment and loan size determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financing challenges for SMEs in CBEC due to limited credit histories, addressed by leveraging 3PL-led SCF with in-transit inventory as collateral.

Method: Combines QRGMM for risk estimation and DeepFM for covariate interactions, creating a unified framework for flexible risk measures and loan levels.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world data, the model effectively assesses credit risk and determines loan sizes.

Conclusion: A pioneering use of generative AI in CBEC SCF, improving credit practices and SME access to capital.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

TL;DR: SecFwT is a framework for efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs using MPC, addressing computational overhead and inefficiency in MPC settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to privacy-sensitive domains is challenging due to data scarcity and privacy constraints, with existing MPC methods limited to inference.

Method: Proposes SecFwT, a forward-only tuning paradigm with MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to replace softmax attention.

Result: SecFwT significantly improves efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SecFwT advances privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning, addressing key computational and efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

TL;DR: The paper explores how in-context learning (ICL) works with missing or incorrect labels, showing that multilayer transformers outperform one-layer models by leveraging unlabeled data through polynomial estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why ICL remains effective despite imperfect labels and to improve semi-supervised learning in tabular data.

Method: Theoretical analysis of one-layer and multilayer transformers under a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with missing labels, connecting transformer behavior to Expectation Maximization.

Result: Multilayer transformers implicitly construct polynomial estimators, enabling effective use of unlabeled data, with performance improving exponentially with depth.

Conclusion: Looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models enhances semi-supervised learning, validated by real-world dataset evaluations.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to predict abnormal values of unprescribed clinical tests using performed test results, focusing on CBC and routine biochemical panels, achieving up to 8% AUC improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis is crucial, and predicting abnormal test values from existing results can make it more accessible. CBC tests are widely used, making them ideal for this purpose.

Method: Formulates the problem as a set translation task, using GPT-like embeddings for labels and values, handling missing data without estimation.

Result: Achieves up to 8% AUC improvement in predicting high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges LLMs with tabular clinical data, improving diagnostic predictions without estimating missing values.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

*Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Yuto Iwasaki, Meguru Yamazaki, Yasufumi Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel knowledge distillation framework for neural network potentials (NNPs) avoids fine-tuning the teacher model, enabling better exploration of high-energy structures and reducing DFT calculations by 10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods fine-tune NNPs, increasing energy barriers and limiting high-energy structure exploration, which is crucial for stable MD simulations.

Method: Proposes a two-stage training: student NNP trained with data from a non-fine-tuned teacher, then fine-tuned with a small DFT dataset.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties for organic and inorganic materials while reducing DFT calculations by 10x.

Conclusion: The framework improves NNP training efficiency and accuracy, especially for high-energy structures, without costly DFT calculations.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

### [303] [Acoustic Waveform Inversion with Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15346)
*A. S. Stankevich, I. B. Petrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI²SB) framework to improve deep learning-based Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) by addressing limitations of diffusion models, such as iterative sampling and heuristic output control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models in FWI struggle with iterative sampling and lack clear methods to incorporate approximate velocity models, limiting their practical use.

Method: The authors propose cI²SB, extending the Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I²SB) for conditional sampling, to interpolate between ground truth and smoothed velocity models.

Result: Experiments show cI²SB outperforms conditional diffusion models, achieving high sample fidelity with fewer neural function evaluations (NFEs).

Conclusion: The cI²SB framework offers a more efficient and effective solution for FWI, validated by superior performance and code availability.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

### [304] [Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15538)
*Laura Kopf, Nils Feldhus, Kirill Bykov, Philine Lou Bommer, Anna Hedström, Marina M. -C. Höhne, Oliver Eberle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a new framework for identifying and scoring polysemantic features in neural networks, improving interpretability by capturing multiple concepts per feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for feature description in neural networks are limited by assumptions of monosemanticity and lack robustness, restricting their ability to fully explain model behavior.

Method: PRISM introduces a framework that provides nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features, addressing the limitations of prior approaches.

Result: PRISM outperforms existing methods in description quality and polysemanticity capture, as demonstrated through benchmarking on language models.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances interpretability by better reflecting the complexity of neural network features, offering more accurate and faithful descriptions.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

*David Dembinsky, Adriano Lucieri, Stanislav Frolov, Hiba Najjar, Ko Watanabe, Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for Explainable AI (XAI) by introducing a unified framework (VXAI) and categorizing metrics from 362 publications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of black-box AI models like Deep Neural Networks undermines trustworthiness, necessitating rigorous evaluation of XAI explanations.

Method: A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, aggregating 362 publications into 41 metric groups and proposing a three-dimensional categorization scheme.

Result: The VXAI framework offers a structured overview, enabling systematic metric selection and comparability across XAI methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible foundation for future XAI evaluation, promoting transparency and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

### [306] [Enhancing One-run Privacy Auditing with Quantile Regression-Based Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15349)
*Terrance Liu, Matteo Boglioni, Yiwei Fu, Shengyuan Hu, Pratiksha Thaker, Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve one-run DP auditing in black-box settings by using stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) with quantile regression, achieving tighter bounds while remaining computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-run DP auditing methods in black-box settings show a gap between empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds, prompting the need for improved techniques.

Method: The approach incorporates quantile regression for stronger MIA to enhance one-run auditing of DP-SGD in black-box settings, evaluated on CIFAR-10 image classification models.

Result: The proposed method achieves tighter empirical lower bounds on privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Using quantile regression for MIA improves one-run DP auditing in black-box settings, bridging the gap between empirical and theoretical bounds efficiently.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

### [307] [LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15606)
*Gabrel J. Perin, Runjin Chen, Xuxi Chen, Nina S. T. Hirata, Zhangyang Wang, Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in aligned LLMs where safety protections can be undermined by fine-tuning, even with benign data. It proposes LoX, a training-free method to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating low-rank subspaces, reducing attack success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' safety protections are vulnerable to fine-tuning, posing risks in real-world applications. The paper aims to address this by improving robustness without compromising adaptability.

Method: The authors propose Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), a training-free method that extrapolates safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to enhance robustness against fine-tuning attacks.

Result: LoX reduces attack success rates by 11% to 54% against benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks while maintaining task adaptability.

Conclusion: LoX effectively improves LLM safety robustness by moving parameters to a flatter, less sensitive zone, demonstrating practical utility for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

*Rui Yu, Shenghua Wan, Yucen Wang, Chen-Xiao Gao, Le Gan, Zongzhang Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey on reward modeling techniques in deep reinforcement learning, covering background, recent approaches, applications, evaluation methods, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in systematic reviews of reward models in RL, guiding policy optimization by aligning rewards with true objectives.

Method: Categorizes reward modeling approaches by source, mechanism, and learning paradigm, and reviews evaluation methods.

Result: Comprehensive overview of established and emerging reward modeling techniques.

Conclusion: Highlights promising research directions and fills the literature gap in reward model reviews.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiTMC adapts Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for molecular conformer generation, addressing challenges like integrating graph data with 3D geometry and handling symmetries. It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying DiTs to molecules introduces challenges like combining discrete graph data with continuous 3D geometry and managing Euclidean symmetries.

Method: DiTMC uses a modular architecture to separate 3D coordinate processing from atomic connectivity conditioning, with graph-based strategies and flexible attention mechanisms.

Result: DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity on benchmarks like GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, and -XL.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the impact of architectural choices and symmetry priors, offering promising directions for large-scale molecular structure modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

*Tevin Wang, Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule automates rule extraction from human feedback for RLHF, improving model performance and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual rule engineering in RLHF is inefficient; AutoRule aims to automate this process for better scalability and performance.

Method: AutoRule uses a reasoning model to interpret preferences, extracts candidate rules, and synthesizes them into a rule set for auxiliary rewards.

Result: AutoRule boosts performance (28.6% on AlpacaEval2.0, 6.1% on MT-Bench) and reduces reward hacking compared to learned reward models.

Conclusion: AutoRule effectively automates rule extraction, enhancing RLHF performance and aligning with human preferences.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

*Scott Jeen, Tom Bewley, Jonathan M. Cullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memory-based architectures improve zero-shot RL performance under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot RL assumes Markov states, but real-world applications often involve partial observability, degrading performance.

Method: Memory-based architectures are introduced to address partial observability in zero-shot RL.

Result: Memory-based methods outperform memory-free baselines in partially observable domains.

Conclusion: Memory-based architectures are effective for zero-shot RL in partially observable settings.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

*Damin Kühn, Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel method for learning ground metrics in optimal transport to improve performance in tasks like embedding, clustering, and classification, using class labels on a distribution-level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predefined or supervised ground metrics in optimal transport often fail to account for data structure or generalize across classes.

Method: Learns a global ground metric for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space, using only distribution-level class labels.

Result: The learned metric enhances optimal transport distances, improving performance in embedding, clustering, and classification.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and interpretable, demonstrated on multi-disease scRNA-seq data.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dense latents in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are meaningful and functional, not just training artifacts. They form antipodal pairs, reflect intrinsic residual space properties, and evolve across layers from structural to semantic roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether dense latents in SAEs are undesirable artifacts or meaningful representations, given concerns about their frequent activation.

Method: Systematic study of dense latents' geometry, function, and origin, including ablation experiments and taxonomy development. Analysis of their evolution across model layers.

Result: Dense latents are persistent and functional, forming antipodal pairs and reflecting intrinsic properties. They serve roles like position tracking, context binding, and output signals, evolving across layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents are meaningful and functional in language models, not mere noise, and should be studied further.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

*Simiao Lin, Wannes Meert, Pieter Robberechts, Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel technique simplifies warping paths to highlight and visualize key transformations in time series, improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack qualitative comparison and fail to show broader structural relationships between subsequences in time series.

Method: Proposes a technique to simplify warping paths, highlighting key transformations like shifts, compressions, and amplitude differences.

Result: Enhances interpretability by clearly representing how subsequences match between time series.

Conclusion: The method provides a clearer, more interpretable visualization of time series comparisons.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for exploration using diffusion models, leveraging entropy maximization and density estimation without explicit uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generative models to explore novel designs in real-world decision-making problems like scientific discovery, beyond mimicking existing data.

Method: Proposes entropy maximization over a diffusion model's implicit data manifold, connects entropy to the score function, and uses mirror descent for sequential fine-tuning.

Result: Convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model is proven, with promising empirical results on synthetic and text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages diffusion models for exploration, offering scalable and theoretically grounded solutions.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

*Sepehr Elahi, Paula Mürmann, Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses minimizing disease extinction time in an SIS model with an unknown graph, proposing a learning algorithm for graph recovery and optimal vaccination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of optimal vaccination when the underlying graph of disease spread is unknown, a practical scenario not addressed by prior work.

Method: The method involves splitting the problem into graph learning and vaccination strategy. A novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm is introduced, and optimal algorithms for SRM are detailed, with a focus on bounded treewidth graphs.

Result: The results include sample complexity bounds for graph recovery, polynomial-time algorithms for SRM on bounded treewidth graphs, and an efficient greedy heuristic for general graphs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with experimental validation on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed learning and vaccination algorithms.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

TL;DR: RHO proposes adaptive homophily learning for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by addressing diverse homophily patterns in normal nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume uniform homophily in normal nodes, which often fails in real-world datasets where homophily varies. RHO aims to address this limitation.

Method: RHO introduces adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA) to learn and align diverse homophily patterns in labeled normal nodes.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show RHO effectively captures varying homophily and outperforms competing methods.

Conclusion: RHO robustly learns diverse homophily patterns, improving anomaly detection in graphs with limited labeled normal nodes.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

### [318] [Pixel-level Certified Explanations via Randomized Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15499)
*Alaa Anani, Tobias Lorenz, Mario Fritz, Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a certification framework to ensure pixel-level robustness in post-hoc attribution methods for deep learning predictions, addressing their vulnerability to small input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc attribution methods are non-robust to small input perturbations, undermining their trustworthiness. The paper aims to provide rigorous robustness guarantees for these methods.

Method: The framework uses randomized smoothing to sparsify and smooth attribution maps, reformulating the task as a segmentation problem. It certifies each pixel's importance against ℓ₂-bounded perturbations.

Result: The proposed method is evaluated on 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models, showing robust, interpretable, and faithful certified attributions.

Conclusion: The certification framework enables reliable use of attribution methods in downstream tasks by ensuring robustness, localization, and faithfulness.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

*Artur André Oliveira, Mateus Espadoto, Roberto Hirata Jr., Roberto M. Cesar Jr., Alex C. Telea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data uses MLLMs to enable customizable, interpretable visualizations via natural-language prompts, enhancing cluster separation and interactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR techniques lack the ability to explore semantic structure not directly available in variables or labels, limiting their adaptability to user needs.

Method: The framework employs zero-shot classification with MLLMs, allowing users to dynamically steer projections via natural-language prompts to uncover high-level semantic relationships.

Result: The method improves cluster separation and transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: This approach bridges automated DR and human-centered exploration, offering flexible, adaptable projections tailored to specific analytical needs.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

*Ivan Marisca, Jacob Bamberger, Cesare Alippi, Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes spatiotemporal over-squashing in STGNNs, revealing unique challenges compared to static GNNs, and provides theoretical and empirical insights for better designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored issue of over-squashing in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), where temporal dimensions exacerbate information propagation limitations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of spatiotemporal over-squashing, comparing static and dynamic contexts, and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Convolutional STGNNs favor distant temporal information propagation, and both time-and-space and time-then-space paradigms are equally affected by over-squashing.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into STGNN dynamics and principled guidance for more effective architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

*Mohammadreza Nemati, Zhipeng Huang, Kevin S. Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIT-LVM introduces a low-dimensional latent representation for feature interactions in linear predictors, improving accuracy and mitigating overfitting compared to elastic net and factorization machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear predictors often use interaction terms for non-linear relationships, but estimating their coefficients accurately is challenging, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Method: LIT-LVM represents features with latent vectors in low-dimensional space, leveraging structured regularization to reduce overfitting.

Result: LIT-LVM outperforms elastic net and factorization machines in prediction accuracy, especially with many interaction terms relative to samples, and provides interpretable latent representations.

Conclusion: LIT-LVM offers a robust solution for high-dimensional interaction term estimation, combining accuracy with interpretability.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

### [323] [RePCS: Diagnosing Data Memorization in LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15513)
*Le Vu Anh, Nguyen Viet Anh, Mehmet Dik, Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePCS is a model-agnostic method to detect if LLMs rely on memorized data instead of retrieved context in RAG systems, using KL divergence between parametric and retrieval-augmented paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs bypassing retrieved evidence and producing contaminated outputs in RAG systems.

Method: RePCS compares two inference paths (parametric and retrieval-augmented) via KL divergence to measure the impact of retrieved context.

Result: Achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918 on Prompt-WNQA, outperforming prior methods by 6.5%, with low latency overhead (<4.7%).

Conclusion: RePCS provides a lightweight, black-box safeguard for verifying meaningful retrieval use in RAG systems, crucial for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplified analysis of SGD in linear regression using basic linear algebra, matching prior results without complex PSD matrix manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make SGD analysis more accessible and facilitate further improvements in training realistic models.

Method: Uses simple linear algebra tools to derive bias and variance bounds, avoiding complex PSD matrix operations.

Result: Recovers the same bounds as prior work, demonstrating the effectiveness of the simplified approach.

Conclusion: The simplified analysis enhances accessibility and potential for future extensions like mini-batching and learning rate scheduling.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional input-output observations in learning general recursive functions by incorporating computational constraints and new observation types.

Method: Extends Gold's framework with Time-Bound Observations and Policy-Trajectory Observations, and analyzes learnability under computational complexity constraints.

Result: Overcomes learning barriers for general recursive functions with new observation types, connects policy-trajectory learning to finite-state transducer inference, and proves negative results for linear-time computable functions.

Conclusion: The study provides a formal framework for learning computable functions under realistic constraints, revealing new insights and limitations in inductive inference.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in real-world Wi-Fi fingerprinting due to domain shifts from device heterogeneity and temporal variations, leading to poor generalization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes DAILOC, using a multi-level variational autoencoder for disentanglement and memory-guided class latent alignment to mitigate domain shifts and forgetting.

Result: Achieves up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances.

Conclusion: DAILOC effectively addresses domain shifts and catastrophic forgetting, significantly improving indoor localization performance.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

TL;DR: The paper identifies gradient pathologies and non-stationarity as key challenges in scaling deep reinforcement learning, proposing simple interventions to stabilize gradient flow for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing the root causes of degraded performance in scaled deep reinforcement learning networks.

Method: Empirical analyses to identify issues, followed by proposing and validating simple interventions to stabilize gradient flow.

Result: Improved performance across various network depths and widths, validated on multiple agents and environments.

Conclusion: Simple interventions can effectively address scaling challenges in deep reinforcement learning, enabling robust large-scale performance.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

*Danish Gufran, Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogNet is a logic gate-based framework that enhances interpretability and performance of DL-based indoor localization, reducing errors, model size, and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL models for indoor localization lack interpretability, making it hard to understand predictions or adapt to environmental noise over time.

Method: LogNet uses logic gates to identify influential access points and diagnose how noise affects localization decisions.

Result: LogNet achieves lower localization error, smaller model size, and reduced latency compared to prior DL models.

Conclusion: LogNet improves interpretability and long-term reliability of DL-based indoor localization systems.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

Motivation: To enhance neural networks' efficiency and sustainability by mimicking human reasoning's compositional ability.

Method: Ensembling zero-shot expert models and testing on a benchmark for compositionality.

Result: Higher accuracy than baselines with reduced computational demands.

Conclusion: The Expert Composition method is efficient and effective for compositional tasks.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning
process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such
property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more
efficient and sustainable AI framework. We propose a compositional approach by
ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a
challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show
that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy
than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence
being more efficient.

*Modar Sulaiman, Kallol Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFLC, a method to correct biased and noisy labels in ML datasets while ensuring fairness, improving both performance and fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unfair outcomes in ML due to biased training data, which affects model fairness and performance.

Method: GFLC combines prediction confidence, graph-based regularization (Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians), and demographic parity incentives.

Result: GFLC significantly improves the trade-off between performance and fairness compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GFLC effectively corrects label noise while maintaining fairness, enhancing trust in ML systems.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci is a self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that uses coding theory and tiny neural modules for efficient mesh smoothing, achieving faster convergence and better results than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time mesh smoothing is challenging due to costly global updates in classical Ricci-flow solvers and slow convergence in greedy heuristics. MicroRicci aims to address these limitations.

Method: MicroRicci combines a greedy syndrome-decoding step (O(E) time) with two small neural modules for adaptive vertex and step-size selection.

Result: On 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci reduces iterations (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread, and achieves high UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation (r = -0.93), with minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: MicroRicci's efficiency, automatic adaptation, and high-quality results make it ideal for real-time applications in graphics and simulation.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in stroke patients shows comparable accuracy to centralized learning, outperforms single-site models, and links BrainAGE to vascular risks and recovery outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in training robust BrainAGE models, this study evaluates FL's performance and its association with clinical outcomes in stroke patients.

Method: Used FLAIR images from 1674 patients across 16 centers, comparing centralized learning, FL, and single-site learning. Analyzed BrainAGE's link to vascular risks and functional outcomes using logistic regression.

Result: FL outperformed single-site models, with BrainAGE higher in diabetic patients. BrainAGE significantly associated with post-stroke recovery outcomes.

Conclusion: FL enables accurate BrainAGE predictions without data centralization, showing potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE reduces memory overhead in DP training by privatizing gradients after projection, using random Gaussian matrices, and applying projection during backpropagation, achieving comparable utility to DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP methods like DP-Adam have high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability.

Method: DP-GRAPE introduces three modifications: privatizing gradients after projection, using random Gaussian matrices, and applying projection during backpropagation.

Result: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% for Vision Transformers and 70% for RoBERTa-Large, with similar performance to DP-Adam. It scales to models like OPT (6.7B parameters).

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE offers a memory-efficient DP training method without sacrificing accuracy or scalability, making it practical for large models.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

*Ranting Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses over-conservative policies in offline RL due to poor explorations in suboptimal data, proposing CAWR with robust loss functions and prioritized replay to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of over-conservative policies in offline RL caused by poor explorations in suboptimal data, which leads to distribution shift and estimation bias.

Method: Proposes Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), using robust loss functions and advantage-based prioritized experience replay to filter poor explorations.

Result: CAWR outperforms on the D4RL benchmark, learning superior policies from suboptimal offline data.

Conclusion: CAWR effectively mitigates over-conservatism in offline RL by addressing poor explorations, enhancing policy optimization performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

### [335] [Informed Correctors for Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21243)
*Yixiu Zhao, Jiaxin Shi, Feng Chen, Shaul Druckmann, Lester Mackey, Scott Linderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a predictor-corrector sampling scheme with an informed corrector to improve efficiency and quality in discrete diffusion models, supported by architectural and training enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for discrete diffusion models struggle with balancing computation and sample quality, especially with reduced steps, despite learning the data distribution well.

Method: Introduces a predictor-corrector scheme with an informed corrector, hollow transformers, and a tailored training objective to counter approximation errors and leverage more training signal.

Result: Demonstrates superior sample quality (fewer errors, better FID scores) on text8 and ImageNet datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Informed correctors enable fast, high-fidelity generation in discrete diffusion models, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has emerged as a powerful framework for generative
modeling in discrete domains, yet efficiently sampling from these models
remains challenging. Existing sampling strategies often struggle to balance
computation and sample quality when the number of sampling steps is reduced,
even when the model has learned the data distribution well. To address these
limitations, we propose a predictor-corrector sampling scheme where the
corrector is informed by the diffusion model to more reliably counter the
accumulating approximation errors. To further enhance the effectiveness of our
informed corrector, we introduce complementary architectural modifications
based on hollow transformers and a simple tailored training objective that
leverages more training signal. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the
failure modes of existing samplers and show how informed correctors alleviate
these problems. On the text8 and tokenized ImageNet 256x256 datasets, our
informed corrector consistently produces superior samples with fewer errors or
improved FID scores for discrete diffusion models. These results underscore the
potential of informed correctors for fast and high-fidelity generation using
discrete diffusion.

*Hezhe Qiao, Hanghang Tong, Bo An, Irwin King, Charu Aggarwal, Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for graph anomaly detection (GAD), focusing on GNN-based methods, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To summarize methodologies and findings in GNN-based GAD studies, addressing the lack of technical insights in existing surveys.

Method: Systematic review from three perspectives: GNN backbone design, proxy task design, and graph anomaly measures, with a taxonomy of 13 method categories.

Result: A detailed taxonomy and comparison of GAD methods, along with datasets and empirical results.

Conclusion: Identifies open problems in GAD and provides a repository for future research, encouraging further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify unusual graph instances
(nodes, edges, subgraphs, or graphs), has attracted increasing attention in
recent years due to its significance in a wide range of applications. Deep
learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been
emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in
capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering
the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount
importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD
studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD
problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of
deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on
task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical
insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique
challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities
and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of
current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology,
including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly
measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13
fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more
in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate
the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used
GAD datasets and empirical comparison. We further discuss multiple open
problems to inspire more future high-quality research. A continuously updated
repository for datasets, links to the codes of algorithms, and empirical
comparison is available at

### [337] [The Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon: Unveiling Training Loss Oscillations in Adam and Other Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10056)
*Qi Liu, Wanjing Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies the Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon (ESP), a sawtooth-shaped loss curve during training with adaptive optimizers like Adam, analyzing its causes and effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the recurring sawtooth pattern in training loss curves, particularly with adaptive optimizers, and its underlying mechanisms.

Method: Empirical analysis of ESP, focusing on factors like Adam's parameters, batch size, data shuffling, and sample replacement, supported by a quadratic minimization task.

Result: ESP arises from adaptive learning rate adjustments and data shuffling effects, with smaller β₂ values exacerbating it but acting as regularization. Higher model capacity amplifies ESP.

Conclusion: ESP is a general pattern in adaptive optimization, not necessarily indicating overfitting, and can be replicated even in simple scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we identify and analyze a recurring training loss pattern,
which we term the \textit{Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon (ESP)}, commonly observed
during training with adaptive gradient-based optimizers, particularly Adam
optimizer. This pattern is characterized by a sharp drop in loss at the
beginning of each epoch, followed by a gradual increase, resulting in a
sawtooth-shaped loss curve. Through empirical observations, we demonstrate that
while this effect is most pronounced with Adam, it persists, although less
severely, with other optimizers such as RMSProp. We empirically analyze the
mechanisms underlying ESP, focusing on key factors such as Adam's $\beta$
parameters, batch size, data shuffling, and sample replacement. Our analysis
shows that ESP arises from adaptive learning rate adjustments controlled by the
second moment estimate. Additionally, we identify the ``immediate re-exposure
to samples'' effect during data shuffling, which causes the model to learn or
memorize more at the beginning of each epoch. We also find that smaller values
of $\beta_2$ exacerbate ESP but can act as a form of regularization. While ESP
is not necessarily indicative of overfitting, higher model capacity can amplify
the phenomenon. To further support our analysis, we replicate ESP through a
high-dimensional quadratic minimization task. We demonstrate that ESP can
emerge even in simple optimization scenarios, reinforcing the generality of
this pattern. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at
https://github.com/qiliuchn/training-loss-pattern.

*Mingsen Du, Meng Chen, Yongjian Li, Xiuxin Zhang, Jiahui Gao, Cun Ji, Shoushui Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CS-DPMamba for MTS node classification, addressing long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity using temporal contrast learning, FastDTW, DPMamba, and KAN-enhanced GIN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTS data's temporal changes and high dimensionality make modeling long-range dependencies and similarities challenging.

Method: Uses temporal contrast learning for representations, FastDTW for similarity, DPMamba for dependencies, and KAN-enhanced GIN for classification.

Result: Achieves precise MTS node classification, outperforming others on UEA datasets in supervised/semi-supervised tasks.

Conclusion: CS-DPMamba effectively addresses MTS challenges, improving classification accuracy by integrating dynamic similarity and dependency modeling.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors
across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and
the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high
dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have
explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However,
long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes
and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively
and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast
similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba).
Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use
temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we
construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic
Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the
bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and
short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the
information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By
comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity
features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments
on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass
diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our
method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS
classification task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised method for MTS classification integrates heterogeneous relationships and shapelets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS classification methods struggle with high-dimensional data and lack of labeled data, leading to poor performance.

Method: Proposes a method combining contrast temporal self-attention, soft dynamic time warping, shapelet learning, and a dual-level graph attention network to construct a heterogeneous graph for classification.

Result: Outperforms current methods on Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification, and University of East Anglia datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates additional information and improves semi-supervised MTS classification.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields
such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from
complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However,
existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively
modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor
classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous
relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS
classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various
types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them.
Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to
obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between
these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity
graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types,
incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional
information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a
heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to
get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a
heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving
precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity
Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS
classification tasks, validating its superiority.

*Yihao Xue, Jiping Li, Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG) using kernel methods to analyze interactions between weak and strong models, revealing how strong models surpass weak supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how weak models can supervise stronger ones, analogous to human guidance of superhuman AI, is crucial for future AI development.

Method: The study uses kernels from principal components of models' internal representations to define a space capturing weak-to-strong learning gaps.

Result: The theory provides a label-free metric predicting W2SG performance, validated on molecular predictions and NLP tasks with 52 LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical insights into correcting weak supervision errors and optimizing strong model performance.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG), where a weak model supervises a
stronger one, serves as an important analogy for understanding how humans might
guide superhuman intelligence in the future. Promising empirical results
revealed that a strong model can surpass its weak supervisor. While recent work
has offered theoretical insights into this phenomenon, a clear understanding of
the interactions between weak and strong models that drive W2SG remains
elusive. We investigate W2SG through a theoretical lens and show that it can be
characterized using kernels derived from the principal components of weak and
strong models' internal representations. These kernels can be used to define a
space that, at a high level, captures what the weak model is unable to learn
but is learnable by the strong model. The projection of labels onto this space
quantifies how much the strong model falls short of its full potential due to
weak supervision. This characterization also provides insights into how certain
errors in weak supervision can be corrected by the strong model, regardless of
overfitting. Our theory has significant practical implications, providing a
representation-based metric that predicts W2SG performance trends without
requiring labels, as shown in experiments on molecular predictions with
transformers and 5 NLP tasks involving 52 LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of context-based meta-RL methods in handling out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: Proposes Task-Aware Virtual Training (TAVT) with metric-based representation learning and state regularization.

Result: Significantly enhances generalization to OOD tasks in MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments.

Conclusion: TAVT effectively captures task characteristics and improves performance on unseen tasks.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning aims to develop policies that generalize to
unseen tasks sampled from a task distribution. While context-based meta-RL
methods improve task representation using task latents, they often struggle
with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To address this, we propose Task-Aware
Virtual Training (TAVT), a novel algorithm that accurately captures task
characteristics for both training and OOD scenarios using metric-based
representation learning. Our method successfully preserves task characteristics
in virtual tasks and employs a state regularization technique to mitigate
overestimation errors in state-varying environments. Numerical results
demonstrate that TAVT significantly enhances generalization to OOD tasks across
various MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper discusses how LLMs may memorize personal data, making them subject to data protection laws like GDPR, and calls for legal and technical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the legal implications of LLMs memorizing personal data and the need for compliance with data protection laws.

Method: The paper reiterates LLMs' ability to output memorized data, demonstrates their classification as personal data, and proposes solutions for legal compliance.

Result: LLMs can be considered personal data, triggering GDPR requirements, and necessitating legal-technical collaboration.

Conclusion: The paper urges ML researchers to address legal implications of LLMs as personal data and advocates for better alignment between law and technology.

Abstract: Does GPT know you? The answer depends on your level of public recognition;
however, if your information was available on a website, the answer could be
yes. Most Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize training data to some extent.
Thus, even when an LLM memorizes only a small amount of personal data, it
typically falls within the scope of data protection laws. If a person is
identified or identifiable, the implications are far-reaching. The LLM is
subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements even after the
training phase is concluded. To back our arguments: (1.) We reiterate that LLMs
output training data at inference time, be it verbatim or in generalized form.
(2.) We show that some LLMs can thus be considered personal data on their own.
This triggers a cascade of data protection implications such as data subject
rights, including rights to access, rectification, or erasure. These rights
extend to the information embedded within the AI model. (3.) This paper argues
that machine learning researchers must acknowledge the legal implications of
LLMs as personal data throughout the full ML development lifecycle, from data
collection and curation to model provision on e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face.
(4.) We propose different ways for the ML research community to deal with these
legal implications. Our paper serves as a starting point for improving the
alignment between data protection law and the technical capabilities of LLMs.
Our findings underscore the need for more interaction between the legal domain
and the ML community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a virtual particle stochastic approximation method for gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space, offering efficient convergence and i.i.d. sampling without requiring propagation of chaos bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for optimizing functionals over probability distributions using interacting particle systems face challenges in analyzing convergence and dependency issues.

Method: The proposed virtual particle stochastic approximation, inspired by Stein Variational Gradient Descent, acts as stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space.

Result: The algorithm converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to the infinite particle limit and produces i.i.d. samples.

Conclusion: The method simplifies analysis by avoiding explicit propagation of chaos bounds while maintaining efficiency and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize
functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using
an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms
requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that
the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the
optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing
efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle
system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation,
originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can
be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and
can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our
algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions
similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d.
samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.

TL;DR: KANITE uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation, outperforming MLPs with unique architectures for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ITE estimation in causal inference by leveraging KANs' ability to learn univariate activation functions, addressing limitations of traditional MLPs.

Method: KANITE employs two architectures: 1) IPM for aligning ITE estimation, and 2) Entropy Balancing for covariate balancing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in benchmark datasets for PEHE and ATE metrics.

Conclusion: KANITE demonstrates the potential of KANs to advance causal inference, offering improved accuracy across applications.

Abstract: We introduce KANITE, a framework leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)
for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation under multiple treatments
setting in causal inference. By utilizing KAN's unique abilities to learn
univariate activation functions as opposed to learning linear weights by
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we improve the estimates of ITEs. The KANITE
framework comprises two key architectures: 1.Integral Probability Metric (IPM)
architecture: This employs an IPM loss in a specialized manner to effectively
align towards ITE estimation across multiple treatments. 2. Entropy Balancing
(EB) architecture: This uses weights for samples that are learned by optimizing
entropy subject to balancing the covariates across treatment groups. Extensive
evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KANITE outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in both $\epsilon_{\text{PEHE}}$ and
$\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ metrics. Our experiments highlight the advantages of
KANITE in achieving improved causal estimates, emphasizing the potential of
KANs to advance causal inference methodologies across diverse application
areas.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRPA, a preference-based algorithm combining rule-based and preference optimization to address reward hacking and improve reasoning tasks in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in reward-based optimization (e.g., reward hacking) and preference-based methods (e.g., underperformance in reasoning tasks) motivate the development of TRPA.

Method: TRPA integrates rule-based and preference-based optimization, constructs preference levels using predefined rules, and employs a novel RL training algorithm with theoretical guarantees.

Result: TRPA achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks and demonstrates robust stability, while avoiding reward hacking.

Conclusion: TRPA effectively bridges gaps in preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks and offers a stable, hack-resistant alternative to reward-based methods.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent
reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant
performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization
algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve
the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong
performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they
remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms
(such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based
optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration
in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA)
algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based
optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA
naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference
levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and
leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical
monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not
only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits
robust stability. The code of this paper are released and updating on

*Ryoma Sato, Shinji Ito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'influential bandit' problem to model inter-arm interactions in non-stationary environments, proposes an LCB-based algorithm, and shows its near-optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bandit models fail to capture inter-arm interactions, which are common in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes a new algorithm using a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimator tailored to the loss dynamics.

Result: Achieves a regret of $O(KT \log T)$, nearly optimal, and outperforms conventional methods empirically.

Conclusion: The influential bandit framework and proposed algorithm effectively address inter-arm interactions with strong theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: While classical formulations of multi-armed bandit problems assume that each
arm's reward is independent and stationary, real-world applications often
involve non-stationary environments and interdependencies between arms. In
particular, selecting one arm may influence the future rewards of other arms, a
scenario not adequately captured by existing models such as rotting bandits or
restless bandits. To address this limitation, we propose the influential bandit
problem, which models inter-arm interactions through an unknown, symmetric,
positive semi-definite interaction matrix that governs the dynamics of arm
losses. We formally define this problem and establish two regret lower bounds,
including a superlinear $\Omega(T^2 / \log^2 T)$ bound for the standard LCB
algorithm (loss minimization version of UCB) and an algorithm-independent
$\Omega(T)$ bound, which highlight the inherent difficulty of the setting. We
then introduce a new algorithm based on a lower confidence bound (LCB)
estimator tailored to the structure of the loss dynamics. Under mild
assumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \log T)$, which is nearly
optimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon. The algorithm is simple
to implement and computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the presence of inter-arm
influence and confirm the superior performance of our method compared to
conventional bandit algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates for a new privacy paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL) to address shortcomings of traditional frameworks, proposing four core principles for sequential decision-making systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional privacy frameworks are inadequate for RL due to temporal patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics, especially in modern RL paradigms like FedRL and RLHF.

Method: Proposes four core principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation.

Result: Highlights tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability in RL systems for high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: Calls for new theoretical frameworks, practical mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies to ensure effective privacy protection in RL.

Abstract: The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications
demands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy
frameworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential
decision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal
patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics. Modern RL
paradigms, such as federated RL (FedRL) and RL with human feedback (RLHF) in
large language models (LLMs), exacerbate these challenges by introducing
complex, interactive, and context-dependent learning environments that
traditional methods do not address. In this position paper, we argue for a new
privacy paradigm built on four core principles: multi-scale protection,
behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and
context-aware adaptation. These principles expose inherent tensions between
privacy, utility, and interpretability that must be navigated as RL systems
become more pervasive in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous
vehicles, and decision support systems powered by LLMs. To tackle these
challenges, we call for the development of new theoretical frameworks,
practical mechanisms, and rigorous evaluation methodologies that collectively
enable effective privacy protection in sequential decision-making systems.

*Baohao Liao, Hanze Dong, Yuhui Xu, Doyen Sahoo, Christof Monz, Junnan Li, Caiming Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fractured Sampling improves LLM reasoning efficiency by interpolating between full Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and solution-only sampling, reducing token costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT methods incur high token costs, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive settings. Truncated CoT shows potential for efficiency, prompting the development of Fractured Sampling.

Method: Fractured Sampling interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three axes: reasoning trajectories, solutions per trajectory, and truncation depth.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs across benchmarks, showing log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget.

Conclusion: Fractured Sampling offers a scalable and efficient strategy for LLM reasoning, with optimized computation allocation for performance.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional
computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy
by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches
incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive
settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning
before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full
CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight,
we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that
interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal
axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final
solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are
truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks
and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently
achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling

*Nicolas Castanet, Olivier Sigaud, Sylvain Lamprier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRAG improves GCRL by enforcing uniform state coverage in latent spaces, enhancing exploration and control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical GCRL methods in visual environments often over-represent frequently visited states, limiting skill diversity.

Method: DRAG combines β-VAE with Distributionally Robust Optimization, using an adversarial neural weighter to ensure broader state coverage.

Result: DRAG achieves better state space coverage and control performance in hard exploration tasks like mazes and robotic control.

Conclusion: DRAG effectively addresses the limitations of classical GCRL methods by promoting uniform state representation and improving exploration.

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously
acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments
due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online
setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space
evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the
environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the
representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to
latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited
by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the
agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it
learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce
distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space,
to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We
introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that
combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization.
DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to
account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts
of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful
latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state
space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration
environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass,
without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChemHAS improves chemistry tool accuracy by optimizing agent-stacking structures, achieving top performance in four tasks and enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents can reduce prediction errors in chemistry tools, but current methods are limited by inherent tool errors.

Method: Proposes ChemHAS, a hierarchical agent-stacking method to optimize tool performance with limited data.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in four chemistry tasks; identifies four agent-stacking behaviors for better interpretability.

Conclusion: ChemHAS effectively compensates for tool errors and opens new possibilities for AI agents in science.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to
improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools.
However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors
of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how
LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the
tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking),
a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing
agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art
performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our
method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools.
Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking
behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new
possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research. Our code and
dataset are publicly available at https:

*Joshua Barron, Devin White*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between memorization and generalization in LLMs, finding that model size influences whether a model excels at memorization or generalization, with no model succeeding at both when tasks are combined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between memorization and generalization in LLMs, as it remains an open research area with implications for model design.

Method: Pre-training capacity-limited Transformer models on synthetic tasks: arithmetic extrapolation (generalization) and factual recall (memorization).

Result: Small models generalize but fail to memorize; larger models memorize but fail to generalize. No model succeeds at both when tasks are combined.

Conclusion: Pre-training may inherently favor one learning mode over the other, with model capacity shaping behavior, offering insights for small language model design.

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

*Mingkang Wu, Devin White, Evelyn Rose, Vernon Lawhern, Nicholas R Waytowich, Yongcan Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL method mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks, outperforming existing rating-based RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF approaches simplify human reasoning by modeling isolated tasks, missing the complexity of human decision-making.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement learning method that balances classification and regression models using learnable weights, inferred from human ratings in reward-free environments.

Result: The method consistently outperforms existing rating-based RL methods and sometimes surpasses traditional RL approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively captures human decision-making uncertainty and adaptively emphasizes different strategies, improving alignment with user goals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key factor in
aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate
multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often
simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such
as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly
considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in
reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable
weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression
models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making
and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct
several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms
existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional
RL approaches.

### [353] [A Semi-Supervised Approach for Abnormal Event Prediction on Large Operational Network Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07660)
*Yijun Lin, Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semi-supervised method for anomaly detection in network logs, handling varying normal patterns and sparse abnormal events, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume consistent normal behavior or require large labeled datasets, but real-world network logs exhibit varying normal patterns and sparse anomalies.

Method: A novel semi-supervised approach capturing dependencies between time series and across time points, using limited labeled data to learn separable embeddings and leveraging unlabeled data.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in detecting abnormal events in real-world network logs.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised method effectively addresses data scarcity and varying patterns, improving anomaly detection in network logs.

Abstract: Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from
heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important
information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device
malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on
multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have
consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set
of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in
practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying
sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic).
Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel
semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network
time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of
network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the
limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal
and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training
data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large
real-world network log.

*Mark Huasong Meng, Guangdong Bai, Sin Gee Teo, Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a progressive, data-free pruning method for neural networks, using robustness metrics to guide the process, outperforming one-shot approaches in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods rely on fine-tuning with original data, which is often unavailable in practice. The study addresses this by focusing on data-free pruning for resource-constrained platforms.

Method: A conservative, progressive pruning approach using stochastic optimization and robustness-related metrics, implemented as a Python program.

Result: The method significantly outperforms one-shot data-free pruning in robustness preservation and accuracy, validated through experiments on diverse models.

Conclusion: The proposed progressive pruning method is effective for data-free scenarios, offering better robustness and accuracy than traditional one-shot approaches.

Abstract: When deploying pre-trained neural network models in real-world applications,
model consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile
and smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size
and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource
consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the
premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even
retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in
practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model
consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network
pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are
not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in
open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and
retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional
aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as
a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic
optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process.
Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of
experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show
that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning
approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy.

*Ejafa Bassam, Dawei Zhu, Kaigui Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a novel knowledge distillation method using a ranking-based loss to improve student model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current logit-based knowledge distillation methods rely on add-on terms to cross-entropy, requiring careful tuning. PLD aims to simplify and enhance this by leveraging teacher logits as 'worth' scores under the Plackett-Luce model.

Method: PLD uses a weighted list-wise ranking loss to transfer the teacher's full class ranking, optimizing for a teacher-optimal ranking of the true label first, followed by other classes by teacher confidence.

Result: PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by +0.42% over DIST and +1.04% over KD in homogeneous settings, and +0.48% and +1.09% in heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: PLD offers a convex, translation-invariant surrogate for knowledge distillation, outperforming existing methods without additional tuning complexity.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact
"student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger
"teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de
facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically
this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a
correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in
every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must
be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and
recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting
teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation
(PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers
knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its
own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the
true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher
confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes
weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification
benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST
(arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous
settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in
heterogeneous settings.

*Guillaume Salha-Galvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves GAE and VGAE models for industrial use by addressing scalability, directed graphs, dynamic graphs, and unnecessary complexity, while enhancing community detection and link prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAE and VGAE models had limitations hindering industrial adoption, prompting improvements for scalability, versatility, and simplicity.

Method: Proposed strategies include leveraging graph degeneracy, stochastic subgraph decoding, linear encoders, and modularity-aware extensions for directed and dynamic graphs.

Result: Improved scalability for large graphs, support for directed and dynamic graphs, simplified models, and better community detection and link prediction.

Conclusion: The enhanced GAE and VGAE models show promise for industrial applications, particularly in music recommendation and community detection.

Abstract: Graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) emerged as
two powerful groups of unsupervised node embedding methods, with various
applications to graph-based machine learning problems such as link prediction
and community detection. Nonetheless, at the beginning of this Ph.D. project,
GAE and VGAE models were also suffering from key limitations, preventing them
from being adopted in the industry. In this thesis, we present several
contributions to improve these models, with the general aim of facilitating
their use to address industrial-level problems involving graph representations.
Firstly, we propose two strategies to overcome the scalability issues of
previous GAE and VGAE models, permitting to effectively train these models on
large graphs with millions of nodes and edges. These strategies leverage graph
degeneracy and stochastic subgraph decoding techniques, respectively. Besides,
we introduce Gravity-Inspired GAE and VGAE, providing the first extensions of
these models for directed graphs, that are ubiquitous in industrial
applications. We also consider extensions of GAE and VGAE models for dynamic
graphs. Furthermore, we argue that GAE and VGAE models are often unnecessarily
complex, and we propose to simplify them by leveraging linear encoders. Lastly,
we introduce Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE to improve community detection on
graphs, while jointly preserving good performances on link prediction. In the
last part of this thesis, we evaluate our methods on several graphs extracted
from the music streaming service Deezer. We put the emphasis on graph-based
music recommendation problems. In particular, we show that our methods can
improve the detection of communities of similar musical items to recommend to
users, that they can effectively rank similar artists in a cold start setting,
and that they permit modeling the music genre perception across cultures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark, AlgoPerf, to address challenges in evaluating training algorithm improvements, aiming to reliably measure progress in speeding up deep learning training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to reliably identify or compare training algorithm improvements, hindering progress in optimizing training efficiency.

Method: The authors propose the AlgoPerf benchmark, which resolves challenges like measuring training time, handling workload sensitivity, and fair hyperparameter tuning comparisons.

Result: Baseline evaluations show non-trivial gaps between methods, demonstrating the benchmark's feasibility and setting a provisional state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The AlgoPerf benchmark provides a robust framework for future comparisons, enabling reliable identification of training algorithm improvements.

Abstract: Training algorithms, broadly construed, are an essential part of every deep
learning pipeline. Training algorithm improvements that speed up training
across a wide variety of workloads (e.g., better update rules, tuning
protocols, learning rate schedules, or data selection schemes) could save time,
save computational resources, and lead to better, more accurate, models.
Unfortunately, as a community, we are currently unable to reliably identify
training algorithm improvements, or even determine the state-of-the-art
training algorithm. In this work, using concrete experiments, we argue that
real progress in speeding up training requires new benchmarks that resolve
three basic challenges faced by empirical comparisons of training algorithms:
(1) how to decide when training is complete and precisely measure training
time, (2) how to handle the sensitivity of measurements to exact workload
details, and (3) how to fairly compare algorithms that require hyperparameter
tuning. In order to address these challenges, we introduce a new, competitive,
time-to-result benchmark using multiple workloads running on fixed hardware,
the AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. Our benchmark includes a set of
workload variants that make it possible to detect benchmark submissions that
are more robust to workload changes than current widely-used methods. Finally,
we evaluate baseline submissions constructed using various optimizers that
represent current practice, as well as other optimizers that have recently
received attention in the literature. These baseline results collectively
demonstrate the feasibility of our benchmark, show that non-trivial gaps
between methods exist, and set a provisional state-of-the-art for future
benchmark submissions to try and surpass.

*Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti, Christian Kroer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses online decision-making under adversarial resource constraints, proposing primal-dual methods guided by a spending plan to achieve sublinear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in achieving sublinear regret when reward and cost distributions change adversarially over time, which is traditionally impossible.

Method: The authors design primal-dual methods guided by a spending plan, ensuring balanced budget distribution across rounds, and provide a robust variant for imbalanced plans.

Result: The algorithms achieve sublinear regret against baselines following the spending plan, with improved performance for well-balanced plans.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles adversarial changes and benchmarks deviating from the spending plan, offering robust solutions.

Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where
both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change
adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online
resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action
selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are
observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is
well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when
reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this
challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending
plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design
general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to
baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our
algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution
of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our
methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly
imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing
against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

Motivation: To debloat pretrained models without compromising performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QTIP introduces trellis coded quantization (TCQ) for ultra-high-dimensional PTQ, improving quantization quality and inference speed over VQ-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQ-based PTQ methods are limited by low dimensions due to exponential codebook size, restricting quantization quality.

Method: QTIP uses TCQ with a stateful decoder and a hardware-efficient 'bitshift' trellis structure, offering lookup-only to lookup-free trellis codes.

Result: QTIP achieves state-of-the-art results in quantization quality and inference speed.

Conclusion: TCQ-based QTIP outperforms VQ-based PTQ methods by enabling ultra-high-dimensional quantization without exponential codebook growth.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by
quantizing weights to low-precision datatypes. Since LLM inference is usually
memory-bound, PTQ methods can improve inference throughput. Recent
state-of-the-art PTQ approaches use vector quantization (VQ) to quantize
multiple weights at once, which improves information utilization through better
shaping. However, VQ requires a codebook with size exponential in the
dimension. This limits current VQ-based PTQ works to low VQ dimensions ($\le
8$) that in turn limit quantization quality. Here, we introduce QTIP, which
instead uses trellis coded quantization (TCQ) to achieve ultra-high-dimensional
quantization. TCQ uses a stateful decoder that separates the codebook size from
the bitrate and effective dimension. QTIP introduces a spectrum of lookup-only
to computed lookup-free trellis codes designed for a hardware-efficient
"bitshift" trellis structure; these codes achieve state-of-the-art results in
both quantization quality and inference speed.

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating clinical decision support systems prioritizes calibration, robustness, and cost sensitivity, using an adjusted cross-entropy metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scoring rules like accuracy and AUC-ROC don't reflect clinical priorities such as calibration, robustness, and asymmetric error costs.

Method: Proposes a framework based on proper scoring rules (Schervish representation) to adjust cross-entropy for class prevalence uncertainty and cost asymmetries.

Result: The framework is simple, sensitive to clinical conditions, and prioritizes calibrated, robust models.

Conclusion: The method improves evaluation of clinical decision systems by aligning with real-world deployment needs.

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in
clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and
prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules,
such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical
priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and
sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled
yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded
classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences
and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building
on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish
representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that
averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class
balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical
deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both
calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

*Cui Zhang, Wenjun Zhang, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Qiang Fan, Jiangzhou Wang, Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DRL-based quantization level allocation scheme for FL in VEC to optimize training time and quantization error under varying channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL in VEC protects privacy but faces high latency due to large gradients. Quantization reduces latency but introduces errors, requiring joint optimization of training time and QE.

Method: A distributed DRL-based scheme is developed to allocate quantization levels, optimizing long-term rewards for training time and QE.

Result: Simulations identify optimal trade-offs and validate the scheme's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-based approach effectively balances training time and QE in FL-enabled VEC.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can protect the privacy of the vehicles in vehicle
edge computing (VEC) to a certain extent through sharing the gradients of
vehicles' local models instead of local data. The gradients of vehicles' local
models are usually large for the vehicular artificial intelligence (AI)
applications, thus transmitting such large gradients would cause large
per-round latency. Gradient quantization has been proposed as one effective
approach to reduce the per-round latency in FL enabled VEC through compressing
gradients and reducing the number of bits, i.e., the quantization level, to
transmit gradients. The selection of quantization level and thresholds
determines the quantization error, which further affects the model accuracy and
training time. To do so, the total training time and quantization error (QE)
become two key metrics for the FL enabled VEC. It is critical to jointly
optimize the total training time and QE for the FL enabled VEC. However, the
time-varying channel condition causes more challenges to solve this problem. In
this paper, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
quantization level allocation scheme to optimize the long-term reward in terms
of the total training time and QE. Extensive simulations identify the optimal
weighted factors between the total training time and QE, and demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for real-time computing tasks in internet of vehicles (IoV) exceeds vehicles' computing capabilities, necessitating efficient offloading and resource allocation strategies.

Method: A multi-task DT VEC network is established, and a multi-agent reinforcement learning method is used to develop offloading and resource allocation strategies.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method outperforms benchmark algorithms in effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the challenge of task offloading and resource allocation in VEC networks.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for multiple applications on internet of vehicles.
It requires vehicles to carry out multiple computing tasks in real time.
However, due to the insufficient computing capability of vehicles themselves,
offloading tasks to vehicular edge computing (VEC) servers and allocating
computing resources to tasks becomes a challenge. In this paper, a multi task
digital twin (DT) VEC network is established. By using DT to develop offloading
strategies and resource allocation strategies for multiple tasks of each
vehicle in a single slot, an optimization problem is constructed. To solve it,
we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method on the task offloading
and resource allocation. Numerous experiments demonstrate that our method is
effective compared to other benchmark algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOS (MOdel Surgery) addresses catastrophic forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) by using task-specific adapters and a self-refined retrieval mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting persists in CIL despite using Pre-trained Models (PTMs), due to parameter drift and retrieval mismatches.

Method: MOS trains task-specific adapters and merges them to mitigate parameter drift. It also introduces a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show MOS achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MOS effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting in CIL by addressing parameter and retrieval-level issues.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire
knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained
Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting
still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize
lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still
comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative
updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving
irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we
propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous
knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to
downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter
merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap
between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides,
to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free
self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the
model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying
the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in
the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at:

*Kangwei Qi, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a RIS-assisted VEC system using DRL (DDPG and MADDPG) to optimize power allocation and phase-shift, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication link deterioration in VEC due to obstacles, RIS is introduced to enhance performance.

Method: A DRL framework combining DDPG (for RIS phase-shift) and MADDPG (for power allocation) is designed, considering task arrivals and channel variations.

Result: Simulations show the proposed scheme outperforms traditional DDPG, TD3, and stochastic methods.

Conclusion: RIS-assisted VEC with DRL improves system performance significantly, offering a robust solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant
potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to
perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge
devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely
deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading
process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to
assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the
RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this
work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for
local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task
arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme,
we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing
RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user
(VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the
traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.

*Nan Lin, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnergyDiff is a generative AI framework using diffusion models to create synthetic high-resolution energy time series data, addressing privacy and modeling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution energy time series data is essential but often restricted due to privacy concerns, requiring synthetic alternatives. Existing methods struggle with high dimensionality and temporal dependencies.

Method: EnergyDiff employs denoising diffusion probabilistic models with a dedicated denoising network and Marginal Calibration technique for high-resolution time series.

Result: EnergyDiff outperforms baselines in capturing temporal dependencies and marginal distributions, especially at 1-minute resolution, and works across diverse energy domains and resolutions.

Conclusion: EnergyDiff provides a universal solution for generating synthetic energy time series data, validated across multiple domains and resolutions.

Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning
of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such
data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of
synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model
due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies.
Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion
models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy
time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion
probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to
high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration
technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff
achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and
marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute
resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy
domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1
minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and
transformer levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniBioTE is a multi-omic transformer model trained on mixed protein and nucleic acid data, outperforming single-omic models in cross-modal tasks and structural predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-omic models limit cross-modal interactions; OmniBioTE aims to bridge this gap by training on mixed protein and nucleic acid data.

Method: OmniBioTE is trained on 250 billion tokens of unlabeled protein and nucleic acid sequences, learning joint representations and structural insights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in predicting Gibbs free energy changes and identifies key protein residues in binding interactions without structural training.

Conclusion: Multi-omic training enhances performance and efficiency, demonstrating the value of unified modeling for biological sequences.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven
progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules.
To date, most biosequence transformers have been trained on single-omic
data-either proteins or nucleic acids and have seen incredible success in
downstream tasks in each domain, with particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in
protein structural modeling. However, single-omic pre-training limits the
ability of these models to capture cross-modal interactions. Here we present
OmniBioTE, the largest open-source multi-omic model trained on over 250 billion
tokens of mixed protein and nucleic acid data. We show that despite only being
trained on unlabeled sequence data, OmniBioTE learns joint representations
mapping genes to their corresponding protein sequences. We further demonstrate
that OmbiBioTE achieves state-of-the-art results predicting the change in Gibbs
free energy ({\Delta}G) of the binding interaction between a given nucleic acid
and protein. Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers
emergently learn useful structural information without any a priori structural
training, allowing us to predict which protein residues are most involved in
the protein-nucleic acid binding interaction. Lastly, compared to single-omic
controls trained with identical compute, OmniBioTE demonstrates superior
performance-per-FLOP across both multi-omic and single-omic benchmarks,
highlighting the power of a unified modeling approach for biological sequences.

*Adrià Molina Rodríguez, Oriol Ramos Terrades, Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for improving recognition systems' robustness in low-resource languages by leveraging model editing and domain merging, outperforming traditional methods in transfer learning and out-of-domain evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the under-representation of low-resource languages in recognition systems to enhance their practical utility across diverse domains.

Method: Utilizes model editing and domain merging techniques to generalize to new data distributions, such as unseen scripts, without relying on massive pretraining.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvements in transfer learning and out-of-domain evaluation, even with the same training data.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable method for adopting under-represented alphabets, broadening document recognition applicability across cultures and contexts.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

TL;DR: MENSA is a deep learning model for multi-event survival analysis, improving prediction accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting time-to-event for multiple distinct events while capturing their dependencies.

Method: MENSA combines traditional negative log-likelihood with a novel trajectory-based likelihood to learn shared feature representations and event dependencies.

Result: MENSA outperforms baselines in risk and time-to-event prediction, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: MENSA is a scalable and efficient solution for multi-event survival analysis, demonstrating superior performance in real-world clinical datasets.

Abstract: We introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning model for multi-event survival
analysis, which predicts the time until an instance experiences multiple
distinct events based on its features. MENSA learns a shared representation of
the input features while capturing the complex dependence structures between
events. In practice, it optimizes the sum of the traditional negative
log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which
encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur.
Experiments on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that MENSA improves
risk and time-to-event prediction compared to state-of-the-art models across
single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event settings. Moreover, MENSA
achieves this with fewer parameters and lower computational cost (FLOPs) than
several deep learning baselines, particularly in high-dimensional feature
spaces (more than 100 features).

TL;DR: A survey of continual learning methods for generative models, addressing catastrophic forgetting by categorizing approaches into architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in generative models, ensuring adaptability and scalability in real-world applications.

Method: Systematic categorization of continual learning methods for generative models, including large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, inspired by human memory mechanisms.

Result: Provides insights into training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones for continual learning setups in generative models.

Conclusion: The survey offers a comprehensive overview of continual learning methods, highlighting their methodologies and practical implications for generative models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to
comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level
performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally
constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting
to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on
previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous
approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of
generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative
models, including large language models, multimodal large language models,
vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from
the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these
approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and
replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and
motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different
generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core
backbones, offering deeper insights into the field. The project page of this

### [371] [Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12335)
*Ruiyang Hong, Anastasis Kratsios*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a class of ReLU MLPs that are both expressive (universal approximators) and statistically reliable (generalize well), achieving near-optimal sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between large/expressive models (approximation theory) and small/constrained models (learning theory) in deep learning, ensuring both expressivity and generalization.

Method: Constructs a highly structured class of ReLU MLPs with specific width, depth, and sparsity, using Kuhn triangulation to fit linear pieces perfectly.

Result: The MLPs approximate Hölder functions with uniform error, achieve near-optimal sample complexity, and preserve regularity of uniformly continuous functions.

Conclusion: Neural networks can balance expressivity and generalization, solving problems like the McShane extension, by leveraging structured architectures.

Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing
perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for
large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers
classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal
approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are
both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural
networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to
generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this
question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer
perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are
statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function
from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$
error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder
exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$,
depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero
parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except
in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further,
our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian
training samples. We achieve this by fitting together linear pieces perfectly
via the Kuhn triangulation, and we introduce a new proof technique which shows
that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder
functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that
neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite
sets.

TL;DR: EXGRA-MED improves vision-language alignment in medical AI by multi-graph alignment, reducing data dependency and outperforming existing models like LLAVA-MED and BIOMEDGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current med-MLLMs rely on scaling model size and data, leading to weak vision-language alignment and high dependency on costly instruction-following data.

Method: EXGRA-MED uses a multi-graph alignment framework to align images, instruction responses, and extended captions in latent space, with an efficient end-to-end training scheme for scalability.

Result: EXGRA-MED matches LLAVA-MED's performance with 10% of pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and outperforming baselines like BIOMEDGPT and RADFM.

Conclusion: EXGRA-MED offers efficient, high-quality vision-language integration for medical AI, reducing data dependency and improving performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art medical multi-modal LLMs (med-MLLMs), such as LLAVA-MED and
BIOMEDGPT, primarily depend on scaling model size and data volume, with
training driven largely by autoregressive objectives. However, we reveal that
this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models
overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we
introduce EXGRA-MED, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly
aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent
space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to
large LLMs (e.g., LLaMa-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme
using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization.
Empirically, EXGRA-MED matches LLAVA-MED's performance using just 10% of
pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data
performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BIOMEDGPT and RADFM on
visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise
for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.

*T. Konstantin Rusch, Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LinOSS is a state-space model for efficient learning on long sequences, inspired by biological neural networks. It uses forced harmonic oscillators, ensures stability with nonnegative diagonal matrices, and is universal for approximating continuous operators. It outperforms state-of-the-art models like Mamba and LRU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an efficient and stable model for long sequences, inspired by biological neural dynamics, overcoming limitations of restrictive parameterizations in previous state-space models.

Method: LinOSS is based on forced harmonic oscillators, discretized stably using parallel scans. It requires only nonnegative diagonal state matrices and is proven universal for approximating continuous operators.

Result: LinOSS outperforms state-of-the-art models (e.g., Mamba, LRU) by nearly 2x on tasks with sequences up to 50k in length, demonstrating superior performance in classification, regression, and forecasting.

Conclusion: LinOSS is a stable, universal, and efficient model for long sequences, validated by strong empirical results across diverse tasks, making it a significant advancement in sequence modeling.

Abstract: We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently
learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural
networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic
oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast
associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove
that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state
matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying
heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that
LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal
operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In
addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly
conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics.
Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range
interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting.
Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from
mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as
long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS
outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with
sequences of length 50k.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoSAM is a new method for learning unique DAGs in additive noise models with mixed causal mechanisms and general noise distributions, offering scalability and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ANM methods for causal inference rely on restrictive assumptions, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: LoSAM uses local search, introduces new causal substructures, and identifies roots and leaves for efficient top-down learning.

Result: The method achieves asymptotic consistency, polynomial runtime, and state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: LoSAM is a scalable and sample-efficient solution for causal inference in ANMs with mixed mechanisms.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observational data is crucial when
experiments are costly or infeasible. Additive noise models (ANMs) enable
unique directed acyclic graph (DAG) identification, but existing
sample-efficient ANM methods often rely on restrictive assumptions on the data
generating process, limiting their applicability to real-world settings. We
propose local search in additive noise models, LoSAM, a topological ordering
method for learning a unique DAG in ANMs with mixed causal mechanisms and
general noise distributions. We introduce new causal substructures and criteria
for identifying roots and leaves, enabling efficient top-down learning. We
prove asymptotic consistency and polynomial runtime, ensuring scalability and
sample efficiency. We test LoSAM on synthetic and real-world data,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across all mixed mechanism settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasts of opioid overdoses help government agencies prepare and distribute resources effectively.

Method: The study uses county and district-level data, evaluates models of varying complexity, and tests additional covariates to improve forecasting accuracy.

Result: The models produce useful predictions with limited error, even with simple models and common covariates.

Conclusion: Simple forecasting models with readily available covariates can achieve high performance in predicting opioid overdoses.

Abstract: We present efforts in the fields of machine learning and time series
forecasting to accurately predict counts of future suspected opioid overdoses
recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the state of Kentucky.
Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources
related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level
aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future
counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity
were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional
covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to
determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful
predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions,
and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and
relatively simple forecasting models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method to optimize energy consumption and Age of Information (AoI) in C-V2X vehicular communication, addressing resource collisions and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate communication latency and resource collisions in C-V2X systems, and balance energy consumption with communication effectiveness.

Method: Uses Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and DRL to optimize multi-priority queues and AoI, reducing collisions and improving SINR.

Result: Simulations show the proposed DRL-based method outperforms baseline approaches in energy efficiency and AoI.

Conclusion: DRL and NOMA effectively enhance C-V2X communication performance, offering a viable solution for dynamic vehicular networks.

Abstract: To address communication latency issues, the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) has defined Cellular-Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) technology,
which includes Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication for direct
vehicle-to-vehicle communication. However, this method requires vehicles to
autonomously select communication resources based on the Semi-Persistent
Scheduling (SPS) protocol, which may lead to collisions due to different
vehicles sharing the same communication resources, thereby affecting
communication effectiveness. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is
considered a potential solution for handling large-scale vehicle communication,
as it can enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) by
employing Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), thereby reducing the
negative impact of communication collisions. When evaluating vehicle
communication performance, traditional metrics such as reliability and
transmission delay present certain contradictions. Introducing the new metric
Age of Information (AoI) provides a more comprehensive evaluation of
communication system. Additionally, to ensure service quality, user terminals
need to possess high computational capabilities, which may lead to increased
energy consumption, necessitating a trade-off between communication energy
consumption and effectiveness. Given the complexity and dynamics of
communication systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) serves as an
intelligent learning method capable of learning optimal strategies in dynamic
environments. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effects of multi-priority
queues and NOMA on AoI in the C-V2X vehicular communication system and proposes
an energy consumption and AoI optimization method based on DRL. Finally,
through comparative simulations with baseline methods, the proposed approach
demonstrates its advances in terms of energy consumption and AoI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, large model sizes, and reliance on inconsistent datasets in self-supervised learning for EEG.

Method: Introduces CEReBrO with per-channel patch tokenization and alternating attention for intra-channel temporal and inter-channel spatial modeling.

Result: Achieves 2x speed and 6x memory efficiency, with models ranging from 3.6M to 85M parameters. Sets benchmarks in emotion/seizure detection.

Conclusion: CEReBrO validates effectiveness and efficiency in EEG tasks, leveraging public datasets for reproducibility.

Abstract: Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a crucial tool for studying brain activity.
Recently, self-supervised learning methods leveraging large unlabeled datasets
have emerged as a potential solution to the scarcity of widely available
annotated EEG data. However, current methods suffer from at least one of the
following limitations: i) sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, ii) model sizes in
the hundreds of millions of trainable parameters, and iii) reliance on private
datasets and/or inconsistent public benchmarks, hindering reproducibility. To
address these challenges, we introduce a Compact Encoder for Representations of
Brain Oscillations using alternating attention (CEReBrO), a new small EEG
foundation model. Our tokenization scheme represents EEG signals at a
per-channel patch granularity. We propose an alternating attention mechanism
that jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial
correlations, achieving 2x speed improvement with 6x less memory required
compared to standard self-attention. We present several model sizes ranging
from 3.6 million to 85 million parameters. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of
publicly available scalp EEG recordings with diverse channel configurations,
our models set new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks,
with competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction.
This validates our models' effectiveness and efficiency.

*Kartik Sharma, Vineeth Rakesh, Yingtong Dou, Srijan Kumar, Mahashweta Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetSelect, a method to personalize GNN layers for each node to improve classification accuracy by selecting optimal layers based on class prototypes and distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different nodes may require varying granularity of local neighborhood information for accurate classification, challenging the assumption that a single GNN layer suffices for all nodes.

Method: Proposes MetSelect, which selects the optimal GNN layer for each node by identifying class prototypes in transformed layers and classifying based on normalized distances to prototypes.

Result: Significant improvement in node classification accuracy across 10 datasets and 3 GNNs, with deeper and more robust models against poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: The work advocates for adaptive, personalized graph representations, inspiring future research in this direction.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine node attributes over a fixed granularity
of the local graph structure around a node to predict its label. However,
different nodes may relate to a node-level property with a different
granularity of its local neighborhood, and using the same level of smoothing
for all nodes can be detrimental to their classification. In this work, we
challenge the common fact that a single GNN layer can classify all nodes of a
graph by training GNNs with a distinct personalized layer for each node.
Inspired by metric learning, we propose a novel algorithm, MetSelect1, to
select the optimal representation layer to classify each node. In particular,
we identify a prototype representation of each class in a transformed GNN layer
and then, classify using the layer where the distance is smallest to a class
prototype after normalizing with that layer's variance. Results on 10 datasets
and 3 different GNNs show that we significantly improve the node classification
accuracy of GNNs in a plug-and-play manner. We also find that using variable
layers for prediction enables GNNs to be deeper and more robust to poisoning
attacks. We hope this work can inspire future works to learn more adaptive and
personalized graph representations.

Result: CSBM is validated through experiments with synthetic data and VQ image representations, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work bridges a gap in SB applications for discrete spaces, providing a practical solution with CSBM, and makes the code publicly available.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) is a powerful framework for solving generative
modeling tasks such as unpaired domain translation. Most SB-related research
focuses on continuous data space $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and leaves open theoretical
and algorithmic questions about applying SB methods to discrete data, e.g, on
finite spaces $\mathbb{S}^{D}$. Notable examples of such sets $\mathbb{S}$ are
codebooks of vector-quantized (VQ) representations of modern autoencoders,
tokens in texts, categories of atoms in molecules, etc. In this paper, we
provide a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for solving SB in discrete
spaces using the recently introduced Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF)
procedure. Specifically, we theoretically justify the convergence of
discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) to SB in discrete spaces. This enables us to develop
a practical computational algorithm for SB, which we call Categorical
Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (CSBM). We show the performance of CSBM via a
series of experiments with synthetic data and VQ representations of images. The
code of CSBM is available at https://github.com/gregkseno/csbm.

*Nghiem T. Diep, Huy Nguyen, Chau Nguyen, Minh Le, Duy M. H. Nguyen, Daniel Sonntag, Mathias Niepert, Nhat Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical foundations of zero-initialized attention in LLaMA-Adapter, linking it to mixture-of-expert models, and validates its superiority over vanilla attention empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of zero-initialized attention in LLaMA-Adapter are not well understood.

Method: The study provides a theoretical analysis connecting zero-initialized attention to mixture-of-expert models and validates it empirically on open LLM benchmarks.

Result: Non-linear prompts outperform linear ones, and both surpass vanilla attention, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: Zero-initialized attention is robust and adaptable, with non-linear prompts offering greater flexibility for future applications.

Abstract: The LLaMA-Adapter has recently emerged as an efficient fine-tuning technique
for LLaMA models, leveraging zero-initialized attention to stabilize training
and enhance performance. However, despite its empirical success, the
theoretical foundations of zero-initialized attention remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis,
establishing a connection between zero-initialized attention and
mixture-of-expert models. We prove that both linear and non-linear prompts,
along with gating functions, can be optimally estimated, with non-linear
prompts offering greater flexibility for future applications. Empirically, we
validate our findings on the open LLM benchmarks, demonstrating that non-linear
prompts outperform linear ones. Notably, even with limited training data, both
prompt types consistently surpass vanilla attention, highlighting the
robustness and adaptability of zero-initialized attention.

### [381] [Improved Regret in Stochastic Decision-Theoretic Online Learning under Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10997)
*Ruihan Wu, Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses an open problem in stochastic decision-theoretic online learning under differential privacy, improving the upper bound and analyzing a deterministic setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal instance-dependent rate for stochastic decision-theoretic online learning under differential privacy, bridging gaps between known bounds.

Method: Improved upper bound analysis and introduction of a deterministic setting with novel analysis for tighter bounds.

Result: Achieved a $T$-independent upper bound $O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log^2K}{\varepsilon}\right)$ and matched bounds $\Theta(\frac{\log K}{\varepsilon})$ in the deterministic setting.

Conclusion: The work partially resolves the open problem, providing tighter bounds and insights into the deterministic setting.

Abstract: Hu and Mehta (2024) posed an open problem: what is the optimal
instance-dependent rate for the stochastic decision-theoretic online learning
(with $K$ actions and $T$ rounds) under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy?
Before, the best known upper bound and lower bound are $O\left(\frac{\log
K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K\log T}{\varepsilon}\right)$ and
$\Omega\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K}{\varepsilon}\right)$
(where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the gap between the optimal and the second actions).
In this paper, we partially address this open problem by having two new
results. First, we provide an improved upper bound for this problem
$O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log^2K}{\varepsilon}\right)$,
which is $T$-independent and only has a log dependency in $K$. Second, to
further understand the gap, we introduce the \textit{deterministic setting}, a
weaker setting of this open problem, where the received loss vector is
deterministic. At this weaker setting, a direct application of the analysis and
algorithms from the original setting still leads to an extra log factor. We
conduct a novel analysis which proves upper and lower bounds that match at
$\Theta(\frac{\log K}{\varepsilon})$.

### [382] [Alternating Regret for Online Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12529)
*Soumita Hait, Ping Li, Haipeng Luo, Mengxiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper affirms that $o(\sqrt{T})$ alternating regret is achievable for general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) using the continuous Hedge algorithm, and proposes another algorithm for improved time complexity and dimension dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open question of whether $o(\sqrt{T})$ alternating regret is possible for general OCO, building on prior work in adversarial Online Linear Optimization.

Method: Uses the continuous Hedge algorithm for OCO and introduces a Follow-the-Regularized-Leader algorithm with specific regularizers for smooth and self-concordant loss functions.

Result: Achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ alternating regret for OCO and faster convergence rates for specific cases like quadratic losses.

Conclusion: The results advance understanding of alternating regret in OCO and provide practical algorithms for equilibrium finding in game theory, though some lower bounds highlight limitations.

Abstract: Motivated by alternating learning dynamics in two-player games, a recent work
by Cevher et al.(2024) shows that $o(\sqrt{T})$ alternating regret is possible
for any $T$-round adversarial Online Linear Optimization (OLO) problem, and
left as an open question whether the same is true for general Online Convex
Optimization (OCO). We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that
the continuous Hedge algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ alternating regret for
any adversarial $d$-dimensional OCO problems. We show that this implies an
alternating learning dynamic that finds a Nash equilibrium for any
convex-concave zero-sum games or a coarse correlated equilibrium for any convex
two-player general-sum games at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}/T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. To further improve the
time complexity and/or the dimension dependence, we propose another simple
algorithm, Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with a regularizer whose convex
conjugate is 3rd-order smooth, for OCO with smooth and self-concordant loss
functions (such as linear or quadratic losses). We instantiate our algorithm
with different regularizers and show that, for example, when the decision set
is the $\ell_2$ ball, our algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{5}})$ alternating regret with no dimension
dependence (and a better $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ bound for
quadratic losses). We complement our results by showing some algorithm-specific
alternating regret lower bounds, including a somewhat surprising
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for a Regret Matching variant that is widely
used in alternating learning dynamics.

### [383] [Bandit and Delayed Feedback in Online Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18709)
*Yuki Shibukawa, Taira Tsuchiya, Shinsaku Sakaue, Kenji Yamanishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes algorithms for online structured prediction with bandit and delayed feedback, addressing limitations of full-information settings. It provides regret bounds and compares performance numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-information feedback is often impractical for complex outputs, motivating the need for algorithms that work with bandit and delayed feedback.

Method: The paper introduces algorithms using inverse-weighted gradient estimators and a pseudo-inverse matrix estimator to handle bandit feedback. It also covers delayed feedback scenarios.

Result: For bandit feedback, regret bounds of O(√KT) and O(T^{2/3}) are achieved, the latter independent of K. Numerical comparisons and analyses for delayed feedback are provided.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms effectively address practical feedback limitations, offering scalable solutions for online structured prediction.

Abstract: Online structured prediction is a task of sequentially predicting outputs
with complex structures based on inputs and past observations, encompassing
online classification. Recent studies showed that in the full-information
setting, we can achieve finite bounds on the \textit{surrogate regret}, i.e.
the extra target loss relative to the best possible surrogate loss. In
practice, however, full-information feedback is often unrealistic as it
requires immediate access to the whole structure of complex outputs. Motivated
by this, we propose algorithms that work with less demanding feedback, bandit
and delayed feedback. For bandit feedback, by using a standard inverse-weighted
gradient estimator, we achieve a surrogate regret bound of $O(\sqrt{KT})$ for
the time horizon $T$ and the size of the output set $K$. However, $K$ can be
extremely large when outputs are highly complex, resulting in an undesirable
bound. To address this issue, we propose another algorithm that achieves a
surrogate regret bound of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is independent of $K$. This is
achieved with a carefully designed pseudo-inverse matrix estimator.
Furthermore, we numerically compare the performance of these algorithms, as
well as existing ones. Regarding delayed feedback, we provide algorithms and
regret analyses that cover various scenarios, including full-information and
bandit feedback, as well as fixed and variable delays.

### [384] [Data Distributional Properties As Inductive Bias for Systematic Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20499)
*Felipe del Rio, Alain Raymond-Saez, Daniel Florea, Rodrigo Toro Icarte, Julio Hurtado, Cristian B. Calderon, Alvaro Soto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how training data properties (diversity, burstiness, latent intervention) enhance systematic generalization (SG) in deep neural networks, with diversity showing an 89% accuracy boost. NMI between latent attributes predicts out-of-distribution generalization, linked to parallel neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with systematic generalization (SG), and while prior work focused on architectures or training methods, this study investigates how training data properties can improve SG.

Method: The study examines three data properties: diversity (expanding latent property values), burstiness (restricting latent values per input), and latent intervention (randomly altering latent factors). Experiments test their impact on SG and analyze NMI's role.

Result: All three properties significantly improve SG, with diversity yielding an 89% accuracy increase. NMI between latent attributes predicts generalization, with lower NMI linked to more parallel neural representations.

Conclusion: Training data properties, especially diversity, burstiness, and latent intervention, enhance SG. NMI serves as a predictor for generalization, with its reduction promoting parallelism in neural representations, aiding analogical reasoning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle at systematic generalization (SG).
Several studies have evaluated the possibility to promote SG through the
proposal of novel architectures, loss functions or training methodologies. Few
studies, however, have focused on the role of training data properties in
promoting SG. In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data
distributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a
multi-modal language model. To this end, we study three different properties.
First, data diversity, instantiated as an increase in the possible values a
latent property in the training distribution may take. Second, burstiness,
where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent
factors on particular inputs during training. Third, latent intervention, where
a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that
all three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89%
absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series
of experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties
promote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between
latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of
out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI
induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that
NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features
coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the
capacity of reasoning by analogy.

### [385] [Constrained Linear Thompson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02043)
*Aditya Gangrade, Venkatesh Saligrama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study safe linear bandits (SLBs), where an agent selects actions from a
convex set to maximize an unknown linear objective subject to unknown linear
constraints in each round. Existing methods for SLBs provide strong regret
guarantees, but require solving expensive optimization problems (e.g.,
second-order cones, NP hard programs). To address this, we propose Constrained
Linear Thompson Sampling (COLTS), a sampling-based framework that selects
actions by solving perturbed linear programs, which significantly reduces
computational costs while matching the regret and risk of prior methods. We
develop two main variants: S-COLTS, which ensures zero risk and
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ regret given a safe action, and R-COLTS, which
achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ regret and risk with no instance
information. In simulations, these methods match or outperform state of the art
SLB approaches while substantially improving scalability. On the technical
front, we introduce a novel coupled noise design that ensures frequent `local
optimism' about the true optimum, and a scaling-based analysis to handle the
per-round variability of constraints.

### [386] [MAD-MAX: Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures for Automated LLM Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06253)
*Stefan Schoepf, Muhammad Zaid Hameed, Ambrish Rawat, Kieran Fraser, Giulio Zizzo, Giandomenico Cornacchia, Mark Purcell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAD-MAX is a novel automated LLM Red Teaming method that outperforms existing approaches like TAP in attack success rate and efficiency, achieving 97% jailbreak success on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro with fewer queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaks and the limitations of existing Red Teaming methods (cost inefficiency, low success rates, lack of diversity, and poor extensibility) drive the need for a better solution.

Method: MAD-MAX automates attack strategy assignment into clusters, selects relevant clusters for malicious goals, combines strategies for diverse attacks, merges promising attacks iteratively, and prunes similar attacks for efficiency.

Result: MAD-MAX achieves a 97% attack success rate on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro, outperforming TAP (66%), and requires only 10.9 average queries compared to TAP's 23.3.

Conclusion: MAD-MAX is a highly effective, efficient, and extensible solution for automated LLM Red Teaming, addressing the shortcomings of existing methods.

Abstract: With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that
create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking
strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for
security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short
in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as
new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse
Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses
automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters,
chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines
strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with
high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at
each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity
filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX
approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack
strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks
with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and
queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals
in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX
does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with
23.3.

*Debabrota Basu, Debarshi Chanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for efficiently learning PDFs and CDFs of sub-Weibull distributions from streaming samples, enabling sublinear space usage and accurate distance estimation (Wasserstein, TV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of resource-efficiently computing probability distributions and their distances from streaming samples, applicable to both light- and heavy-tailed distributions.

Method: Reduces the problem to estimating frequencies of discretized subsets, creating mergeable summaries with sublinear space. Extends to continuous distributions with infinite support.

Result: Algorithms outperform existing methods in time and space complexity, tightly matching lower bounds for discrete distributions. Useful for auditing fairness and privacy.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is efficient and scalable, validated empirically on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Resource-efficiently computing representations of probability distributions
and the distances between them while only having access to the samples is a
fundamental and useful problem across mathematical sciences. In this paper, we
propose a generic framework to learn the probability and cumulative
distribution functions (PDFs and CDFs) of a sub-Weibull, i.e. almost any light-
or heavy-tailed, distribution while the samples from it arrive in a stream. The
idea is to reduce these problems into estimating the frequency of an
\textit{appropriately chosen subset} of the support of a \textit{properly
discretised distribution}. We leverage this reduction to compute mergeable
summaries of distributions from the stream of samples while requiring only
sublinear space relative to the number of observed samples. This allows us to
estimate Wasserstein and Total Variation (TV) distances between any two
distributions while samples arrive in streams and from multiple sources. Our
algorithms significantly improves on the existing methods for distance
estimation incurring super-linear time and linear space complexities, and
further extend the mergeable summaries framework to continuous distributions
with possibly infinite support. Our results are tight with respect to the
existing lower bounds for bounded discrete distributions. In addition, we
leverage our proposed estimators of Wasserstein and TV distances to tightly
audit the fairness and privacy of algorithms. We empirically demonstrate the
efficiency of proposed algorithms across synthetic and real-world datasets.

*George Rapakoulias, Ali Reza Pedram, Panagiotis Tsiotras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a closed-form solution for the Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem for Gaussian Mixture Model boundary distributions, avoiding learning steps and spatial discretizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently control swarms of identical, interacting agents by solving the MFSB problem without relying on spatial discretizations or neural network approximations.

Method: Uses a mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance Steering problem, leveraging semidefinite formulations for tractability.

Result: Demonstrates a highly efficient, closed-form solution for MFSB, handling probabilistic constraints and maintaining numerical tractability.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical and efficient solution for multi-agent control problems with Gaussian Mixture Model boundary distributions.

Abstract: The Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem is an optimization problem
aiming to find the minimum effort control policy to drive a McKean-Vlassov
stochastic differential equation from one probability measure to another. In
the context of multi-agent control, the objective is to control the
configuration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as
captured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available
methods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely
either on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating
optimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization
schemes. For agents following Linear Time Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian
Mixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient
parameterization to approximate the optimal solutions of the corresponding MFSB
in closed form, without any learning step. Our proposed approach consists of a
mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance
Steering problem from the components of the initial mixture to the components
of the terminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the
Covariance Steering problem, the proposed solver can handle probabilistic
constraints on the system's state while maintaining numerical tractability. We
illustrate our approach on a variety of numerical examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs automate student reflection assessment and academic performance prediction, outperforming traditional methods and reducing educator workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reflection evaluation is time-consuming and lacks scalability; LLMs offer a solution.

Method: Used single-agent and multi-agent strategies with zero-shot and few-shot prompting on 5,278 reflections from 377 students.

Result: Single-agent with few-shot matched human evaluations best; LLM-assessed scores improved at-risk student identification and grade prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs can automate reflection assessment, support students, and enhance educational practices.

Abstract: We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment
of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance.
Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not
scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to
transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment
strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques
(zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278
reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the
single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human
evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores
outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade
prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate
reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support
for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the
potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational
practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.

*Guangtao Zheng, Wenqian Ye, Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ShortcutProbe, a group-label-free framework to mitigate spurious bias in deep learning models by identifying and addressing prediction shortcuts in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on spurious correlations, degrading performance on data lacking these correlations. Existing methods require costly group labels.

Method: ShortcutProbe identifies prediction shortcuts in a model's latent space and retrains the model to be invariant to them, improving robustness.

Result: The framework is theoretically effective and empirically improves model robustness across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: ShortcutProbe offers a practical, efficient solution for spurious bias mitigation without group labels.

Abstract: Deep learning models often achieve high performance by inadvertently learning
spurious correlations between targets and non-essential features. For example,
an image classifier may identify an object via its background that spuriously
correlates with it. This prediction behavior, known as spurious bias, severely
degrades model performance on data that lacks the learned spurious
correlations. Existing methods on spurious bias mitigation typically require a
variety of data groups with spurious correlation annotations called group
labels. However, group labels require costly human annotations and often fail
to capture subtle spurious biases such as relying on specific pixels for
predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc spurious bias
mitigation framework without requiring group labels. Our framework, termed
ShortcutProbe, identifies prediction shortcuts that reflect potential
non-robustness in predictions in a given model's latent space. The model is
then retrained to be invariant to the identified prediction shortcuts for
improved robustness. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the
framework and empirically demonstrate that it is an efficient and practical
tool for improving a model's robustness to spurious bias on diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach, UrbanX, for interpretable hypothesis inference in urban and transportation research, addressing challenges like human bias and unstructured data underutilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional urban research workflows are limited by human bias, lack of interpretability, and underuse of unstructured data. The study aims to automate hypothesis generation and refinement for road safety and urban design insights.

Method: UrbanX uses MLLMs to generate safety-relevant questions for street view images, extracts interpretable embeddings, and applies them in regression models for hypothesis testing and refinement.

Result: Experiments on Manhattan street segments show UrbanX outperforms pretrained deep learning models while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: UrbanX offers a scalable, interpretable framework for urban scientific discovery, enhancing trustworthiness for policy applications and uncovering overlooked correlations.

Abstract: Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically
meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as
road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning,
development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However,
traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human
experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to
confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning
approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode
critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference,
enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses
concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs
to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract
interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in
regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis
testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient
significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously
overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental
evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full
interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose
framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from
unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental
outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications
and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable
knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DC-Clustering, a federated clustering method for complex data partitioning, ensuring privacy and performance comparable to centralized clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing federated clustering methods in handling complex data splits (horizontal and vertical) while preserving privacy.

Method: Uses intermediate representations instead of raw data, supports k-means or spectral clustering, and requires one communication round with a central server.

Result: Achieves clustering performance similar to centralized methods, validated on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills a gap in FL research, offering privacy, efficiency, and flexibility for domains like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

### [393] [Free Privacy Protection for Wireless Federated Learning: Enjoy It or Suffer from It?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12749)
*Weicai Li, Tiejun Lv, Xiyu Zhao, Xin Yuan, Wei Ni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bit-flipping differential privacy mechanism for wireless federated learning (WFL) that leverages communication noises and avoids catastrophic bit errors in floating-point numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing digital communication systems using floating-point standards overlook privacy-preserving potential of communication noises due to risks of bit errors.

Method: A channel-native bit-flipping DP mechanism is proposed, involving random bit flips and a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method to transmit only fraction bits.

Result: The mechanism satisfies (λ,ε)-Rényi DP, avoids WFL convergence issues, and outperforms Gaussian mechanisms in privacy and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively preserves privacy in WFL by utilizing communication noises and bit-level perturbations, offering a superior alternative to traditional Gaussian mechanisms.

Abstract: Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for
wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital
communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards,
e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the
potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers,
e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native
bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where
transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to
collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The
key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors
caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved
by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only
transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating
the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the
catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the
bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed
mechanism satisfies (\lambda,\epsilon)-R\'enyi DP and does not violate the WFL
convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the
proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art
Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for

### [394] [Fast Convergence for High-Order ODE Solvers in Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13061)
*Daniel Zhengyu Huang, Jiaoyang Huang, Zhengjiang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs, focusing on high-order Runge-Kutta schemes, and provides theoretical bounds on sampling accuracy under bounded score function derivatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interaction between score function regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error in diffusion probabilistic models for accurate sampling.

Method: Develops p-th order Runge-Kutta schemes under bounded first and second derivatives of the approximate score function, analyzing convergence properties.

Result: The total variation distance between target and generated distributions is bounded, with numerical validation confirming bounded score function derivatives.

Conclusion: Theoretical guarantees for sampling accuracy hold for general forward processes, validated by practical experiments.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a
noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this
reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential
equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often
requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically
approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its
regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to
understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our
analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods
derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential)
Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the
first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we
develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the
total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data
distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}}
+d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$
denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data
dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver.
We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets,
confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score
function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for
general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.

### [395] [A Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer for Human Activity Intensity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13678)
*Yi Wang, Zhenghong Wang, Fan Zhang, Chengling Tang, Chaogui Kang, Di Zhu, Zhongfu Ma, Sijie Ruan, Weiyu Zhang, Yu Zheng, Philip S. Yu, Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Gravityformer, a physics-informed deep learning framework for human activity intensity prediction, integrating gravitational laws to address spatial interaction constraints and over-smoothing in ST-GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ST-GNNs ignore physical constraints of spatial interactions and over-smoothing in spatial correlation modeling, limiting accuracy.

Method: Gravityformer refines transformer attention using gravitational laws, estimates mass parameters from inflow/outflow, models cross-unit interaction likelihood, and mitigates over-smoothing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks on six datasets, with interpretable gravity attention matrices.

Conclusion: Integrating physical laws with deep learning offers novel insights for spatiotemporal predictive learning.

Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based
services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic
spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints
of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial
correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a
physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed
Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to
integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating
constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two
spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the
likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial
interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the
learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon
in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be
explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel
spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for
achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic
experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the
quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art
benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be
disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a
novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for
spatiotemporal predictive learning.

### [396] [Robust Physics-Informed Neural Network Approach for Estimating Heterogeneous Elastic Properties from Noisy Displacement Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14036)
*Tatthapong Srikitrungruang, Matthew Lemon, Sina Aghaee Dabaghan Fard, Jaesung Lee, Yuxiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel IE-PINN method is introduced to robustly estimate heterogeneous elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data, overcoming limitations of existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating elasticity parameters are unstable, noise-sensitive, and struggle with absolute-scale Young's modulus recovery.

Method: IE-PINN uses three neural networks for displacement, strain, and elasticity fields, a two-phase estimation strategy, and innovations like positional encoding and sine activation.

Result: IE-PINN achieves accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: IE-PINN advances elasticity parameter estimation, with potential applications in clinical imaging and mechanical characterization.

Abstract: Accurately estimating spatially heterogeneous elasticity parameters,
particularly Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, from noisy displacement
measurements remains significantly challenging in inverse elasticity problems.
Existing inverse estimation techniques are often limited by instability,
pronounced sensitivity to measurement noise, and difficulty in recovering
absolute-scale Young's modulus. This work presents a novel Inverse Elasticity
Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) specifically designed to robustly
reconstruct heterogeneous distributions of elasticity parameters from noisy
displacement data based on linear elasticity physics. IE-PINN integrates three
distinct neural network architectures dedicated to separately modeling
displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, thereby
significantly enhancing stability and accuracy against measurement noise.
Additionally, a two-phase estimation strategy is introduced: the first phase
recovers relative spatial distributions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio,
and the second phase calibrates the absolute scale of Young's modulus using
imposed loading boundary conditions. Additional methodological innovations,
including positional encoding, sine activation functions, and a sequential
pretraining protocol, further enhance the model's performance and robustness.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that IE-PINN effectively overcomes
critical limitations encountered by existing methods, delivering accurate
absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise conditions. This
advancement holds substantial potential for clinical imaging diagnostics and
mechanical characterization, where measurements typically encounter substantial
noise.

### [397] [Transformers Learn Faster with Semantic Focus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14095)
*Parikshit Ram, Kenneth L. Clarkson, Tim Klinger, Shashanka Ubaru, Alexander G. Gray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse transformers with input-dependent attention converge faster and generalize better than standard or input-agnostic sparse attention, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sparse attention mechanisms impact learnability and generalization in transformers, beyond just computational efficiency.

Method: Empirical evaluation of various attention mechanisms and theoretical analysis linking softmax stability and loss function properties to sparsity.

Result: Input-dependent sparse attention outperforms standard and input-agnostic sparse attention in convergence and generalization.

Conclusion: Semantic focus (input-dependent sparse attention) enhances learning, while input-agnostic sparse attention offers no benefits, as proven theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Various forms of sparse attention have been explored to mitigate the
quadratic computational and memory cost of the attention mechanism in
transformers. We study sparse transformers not through a lens of efficiency but
rather in terms of learnability and generalization. Empirically studying a
range of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention
models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention
models, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a
phenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter
choices. This can be interpreted as demonstrating that concentrating a model's
"semantic focus" with respect to the tokens currently being considered (in the
form of input-dependent sparse attention) accelerates learning. We develop a
theoretical characterization of the conditions that explain this behavior. We
establish a connection between the stability of the standard softmax and the
loss function's Lipschitz properties, then show how sparsity affects the
stability of the softmax and the subsequent convergence and generalization
guarantees resulting from the attention mechanism. This allows us to
theoretically establish that input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide
any benefits. We also characterize conditions when semantic focus
(input-dependent sparse attention) can provide improved guarantees, and we
validate that these conditions are in fact met in our empirical evaluations.

### [398] [RL-Obfuscation: Can Language Models Learn to Evade Latent-Space Monitors?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14261)
*Rohan Gupta, Erik Jenner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent-space monitors detect undesirable behaviors in LLMs, but RL-Obfuscation shows they can be evaded, with token-level monitors being vulnerable while holistic ones remain robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can learn to evade latent-space monitors designed to detect behaviors like deception and unsafe completions.

Method: Introduce RL-Obfuscation, finetuning LLMs via reinforcement learning to bypass monitors while maintaining coherent outputs. Tested on models with 7B to 14B parameters.

Result: Token-level monitors are highly vulnerable; holistic monitors (e.g., max-pooling or attention-based) remain robust. Adversarial policies generalize to unseen monitors.

Conclusion: Latent-space monitors can be evaded, highlighting the need for more robust monitoring methods.

Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in large language
models by leveraging internal model representations rather than relying solely
on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying
behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open
question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors? To study this, we
introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement
learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent
generations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters
and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that
token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More
holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain
robust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single
static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type. Finally, we
study how the policy learned by RL bypasses these monitors and find that the
model can also learn to repurpose tokens to mean something different
internally.

*Yuan Zhuang, Yi Shen, Zhili Zhang, Yuxiao Chen, Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: YOLO-MARL leverages LLMs once for high-level planning in MARL, reducing costs and improving performance in cooperative games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MARL struggles with cooperative strategies; LLMs offer reasoning but are costly for frequent use.

Method: YOLO-MARL uses LLMs once for strategy generation, state interpretation, and planning, then trains decentralized policies.

Result: Outperforms traditional MARL algorithms in cooperative game environments.

Conclusion: YOLO-MARL efficiently integrates LLMs for MARL, reducing costs while enhancing performance.

Abstract: Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have
positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games.
However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative
strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising
candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the
model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions
that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL
(YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning
capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in
cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires
one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state
interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy
training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time
associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained
decentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate
independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different
environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL
algorithms.

*Mengda Ji, Genjiu Xu, Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses credit assignment in cooperative MARL by proposing CORA, a coalition-level method that ensures rational advantage decomposition and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to account for distinct agent contributions at the coalition level, leading to suboptimal policy updates.

Method: Proposes CORA, which evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions and decomposes them using cooperative game theory's core solution, with random coalition sampling for efficiency.

Result: CORA outperforms baselines in matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent benchmarks, especially in tasks with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment is crucial for improving MARL performance, as demonstrated by CORA's effectiveness.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

*Arbind Agrahari Baniya, Tsz-Kwan Lee, Peter W. Eklund, Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) and a deep learning model (S3PO) for super-resolution, addressing distortion and limited datasets in 360° videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited spatial resolution and distortion in 360° videos reduce visual quality, and existing VSR techniques don't account for these issues. Lack of datasets further complicates research.

Method: Proposes S3PO, a deep learning model with recurrent modeling and attention, featuring a custom loss function for spherical distortion. Evaluated on 360VDS.

Result: S3PO outperforms state-of-the-art VSR and 360°-specific models, validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: S3PO effectively addresses 360° video super-resolution challenges, offering improved performance and insights via targeted architectural choices.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces directional-SpeechLlama, a method for multi-channel audio processing using LLMs, achieving directional speech recognition, source localization, and cross-talk suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the under-researched capability of Speech LLMs in processing multi-channel audio with spatial cues.

Method: Proposes directional-SpeechLlama with techniques like S-DOT and CDDA to enhance spatial audio understanding.

Result: The model effectively links textual cues with spatial audio, excelling in speech recognition and source localization.

Conclusion: Directional-SpeechLlama demonstrates strong performance in handling multi-channel audio tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)
with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities.
However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech
recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To
enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition
and source localization tasks.

TL;DR: HAC is a neural speech codec with a hierarchical bottleneck (acoustic, phonetic, lexical) using knowledge distillation from HuBERT and LaBSE, achieving disentangled tokens and superior performance in naturalness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified neural speech codec that bridges acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream tasks.

Method: HAC factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels and uses knowledge distillation from HuBERT (phoneme-level) and LaBSE (lexical).

Result: HAC produces disentangled tokens aligned with phonemes and word-level semantics, outperforming baselines in disentanglement and reconstruction.

Conclusion: HAC is a promising unified discrete speech representation for speech generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel methods (DTM and TITAN) for detecting neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) by analyzing higher-order linguistic macrostructures in visual-stimulated narratives, outperforming traditional microstructural approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of NCDs is vital, and while current methods focus on linguistic microstructures, higher-order macrostructures remain underexplored despite their potential to reflect cognitive abilities.

Method: Two dynamic macrostructural approaches are introduced: Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) for topic evolution tracking and Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) for cross-modal consistency measurement.

Result: TITAN achieved superior performance (F1 = 0.7238 and 0.8889 on two corpora), with macrostructural features being the most significant contributors.

Conclusion: Macrostructural patterns are critical for understanding cognitive impairment in NCDs, offering a promising direction for early detection.

Abstract: Early detection of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is crucial for timely
intervention and disease management. Given that language impairments manifest
early in NCD progression, visual-stimulated narrative (VSN)-based analysis
offers a promising avenue for NCD detection. Current VSN-based NCD detection
methods primarily focus on linguistic microstructures (e.g., pauses, lexical
diversity), which are potentially linked to bottom-up (stimulus-driven)
cognitive processing. While these features illuminate basic language abilities,
the higher-order linguistic macrostructures (e.g., thematic or logical
development), which may reflect top-down (concept-driven) cognitive abilities,
remain underexplored. These patterns are crucial for NCD detection yet
challenging to quantify due to their abstract and complex nature. To bridge
this gap, we propose two novel dynamic macrostructural approaches: (1) Dynamic
Topic Model (DTM) to track topic evolution over time, and (2) Text-Image
Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to measure cross-modal consistency between
speech and visual stimuli. Experimental results validated the efficiency of
proposed approaches in NCD detection, with TITAN achieving superior performance
both on the CU-MARVEL-RABBIT corpus (F1 = 0.7238) and the ADReSS corpus (F1 =
0.8889). The feature contribution analysis revealed that macrostructural
features (e.g., topic variability, topic change rate, and topic consistency)
constituted the most significant contributors in the model's decision pathways,
outperforming investigated microstructural features. These findings underscore
the critical role of macrostructural patterns in understanding cognitive
impairment mechanisms in NCDs.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Deformer,' a deformable CNN variant, to replace rigid kernels in CNNs, improving speech recognition by adapting to asymmetric patterns and coupling better with attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs use symmetric, rigid kernels, which may not capture asymmetric patterns effectively. This study explores whether asymmetric kernels can improve feature extraction and attention coupling.

Method: The authors replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable counterpart (Deformer). They analyze local receptive fields, global attention maps, and kernel offsets.

Result: Deformer improves speech recognition performance by +5.6% relative WER without LM and +6.4% with LM over the Conformer baseline on the WSJ eval92 set.

Conclusion: Deformer's adaptive kernels enhance feature extraction and attention coupling, demonstrating significant performance gains in speech recognition.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive masking approach for efficient pruning of multilingual ASR models, outperforming existing methods and reducing language-specific pruning needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compress multilingual ASR models effectively with minimal performance loss, avoiding the inefficiency of repeated pruning and re-training for each language.

Method: Uses adaptive masking in two scenarios: creating sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (Dynamic ASR Pathways), dynamically adjusting sub-networks.

Result: Outperforms existing pruning methods for sparse monolingual models and discovers better sub-networks for multilingual models, reducing language-specific pruning.

Conclusion: The adaptive masking approach efficiently prunes multilingual ASR models, improving performance and reducing the need for repeated language-specific pruning.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve low-resource ASR performance by generalizing mixup-based augmentation and adding complementary time-axis regularization.

Method: MixRep interpolates hidden representations in neural networks, applicable to acoustic features and layer outputs, and combines mixup with time-axis regularization in a Conformer encoder with joint CTC loss.

Result: MixRep achieves +6.5% and +6.7% relative WER reductions on eval92 and Callhome eval'2000 sets, outperforming SpecAugment.

Conclusion: MixRep is a simple, effective augmentation strategy for low-resource ASR, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

another consumer-grade device (iPhone) highlights the Pro3's balance between
cost-effectiveness and performance. The Matterport Pro3 achieves a denser point
cloud with 1,877,324 points compared to the iPhone's 506,961 points and higher
alignment accuracy with an RMSE of 0.0118 meters. The cloud-to-cloud (C2C)
average distance error between the two point cloud models is 0.0408 meters,
with a standard deviation of 0.0715 meters. The study demonstrates the Pro3's
ability to generate high-quality 3D models suitable for large-scale
applications, leveraging features such as LiDAR and advanced alignment
techniques.

*Akwasi Asare, Dennis Agyemanh Nana Gookyi, Derrick Boateng, Fortunatus Aabangbio Wulnye*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Edge Impulse and deep learning models for real-time Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection on edge devices, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR is a major cause of vision impairment in diabetics, and traditional diagnosis methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive. The study aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for early detection.

Method: Multiple CNN models (MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, custom DNN) were trained on a curated dataset of retinal fundus images, optimized for edge deployment using TensorFlowLite and 8-bit quantization.

Result: MobileNet achieved 96.45% accuracy, while SqueezeNet showed strong real-time performance (176 KB model size, 17 ms latency). ShuffleNet and the custom DNN were resource-efficient for lower-end devices.

Conclusion: Edge AI offers a scalable, timely, and accurate solution for DR detection, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

### [410] [Improving Prostate Gland Segmenting Using Transformer based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14844)
*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Transformer models (SwinUNETR, UNETR) outperform 3D UNet in prostate gland segmentation, reducing label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, with SwinUNETR showing higher robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inter-reader variability and cross-site domain shift in prostate MRI segmentation by evaluating transformer models.

Method: Compared UNETR and SwinUNETR against 3D UNet using three training strategies: single cohort, cross-validated mixed cohort, and gland size-based dataset. Hyperparameters tuned with Optuna.

Result: SwinUNETR achieved higher Dice scores (up to 0.902) than UNETR and 3D UNet, especially in mixed and gland size-based training.

Conclusion: SwinUNETR's global and shifted-window self-attention improves segmentation robustness, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

### [411] [ABC: Adaptive BayesNet Structure Learning for Computational Scalable Multi-task Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15228)
*Yufeng Zhang, Wenrui Dai, Hang Yu, Shizhan Liu, Junhui Hou, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ABC is a novel framework for Neural Image Compression (NIC) that achieves computational scalability through Bayesian network structure learning, addressing the high computational demands of NIC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of NIC is limited by its high computational demands, and existing solutions lack comprehensive control over complexity.

Method: ABC introduces three innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet for neural backbone computations, (ii) a homogeneous multipartite BayesNet for autoregressive unit optimization, and (iii) an adaptive control module for dynamic adjustments.

Result: ABC provides full computational scalability with better adaptivity and control, while maintaining competitive compression performance.

Conclusion: ABC is a versatile and robust solution for computational scalability in NIC, compatible with various architectures using BayesNet representations.

Abstract: Neural Image Compression (NIC) has revolutionized image compression with its
superior rate-distortion performance and multi-task capabilities, supporting
both human visual perception and machine vision tasks. However, its widespread
adoption is hindered by substantial computational demands. While existing
approaches attempt to address this challenge through module-specific
optimizations or pre-defined complexity levels, they lack comprehensive control
over computational complexity. We present ABC (Adaptive BayesNet structure
learning for computational scalable multi-task image Compression), a novel,
comprehensive framework that achieves computational scalability across all NIC
components through Bayesian network (BayesNet) structure learning. ABC
introduces three key innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet
(inter-node structure) for managing neural backbone computations; (ii) a
homogeneous multipartite BayesNet (intra-node structure) for optimizing
autoregressive unit processing; and (iii) an adaptive control module that
dynamically adjusts the BayesNet structure based on device capabilities, input
data complexity, and downstream task requirements. Experiments demonstrate that
ABC enables full computational scalability with better complexity adaptivity
and broader complexity control span, while maintaining competitive compression
performance. Furthermore, the framework's versatility allows integration with
various NIC architectures that employ BayesNet representations, making it a
robust solution for ensuring computational scalability in NIC applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40M facial images, was fine-tuned for biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival). Both models showed high accuracy and robustness, outperforming benchmarks and providing complementary prognostic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop noninvasive, scalable facial biomarkers for health assessment, leveraging AI to estimate biological age and predict survival risk.

Method: FAHR-FaceAge was fine-tuned on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival on 34,389 cancer patient photos. Robustness and independence were tested, and clinical validation was performed using multivariable Cox models.

Result: FAHR-FaceAge achieved a mean absolute error of 5.1 years, outperforming benchmarks. FAHR-FaceSurvival predicted mortality robustly (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). Both models generalized well across demographics and cancer types.

Conclusion: A single foundation model can generate accurate, scalable facial biomarkers for biological aging and mortality risk, enhancing prognostic accuracy when combined.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

*Paula Feldman, Miguel Fainstein, Viviana Siless, Claudio Delrieux, Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) to generate accurate and diverse 3D models of blood vessels, addressing limitations of rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based methods for synthesizing vasculature lack the diversity and complexity of real anatomical data, necessitating a more advanced approach.

Method: The authors developed an RvNN that learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity and geometry features, enabling the generation of new vessel geometries.

Result: The RvNN produces 3D vessel models that closely resemble real data in terms of radii, length, and tortuosity, even for datasets with aneurysms.

Conclusion: This work is the first to use RvNN for blood vessel synthesis, offering potential applications in medical training, simulations, and more.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

TL;DR: A transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework is proposed to enhance neurological disorder (ND) diagnosis by integrating multi-modal MRI and clinical data, achieving 82.47% validation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL methods underperform in leveraging multi-modal MRI and clinical data for ND diagnosis, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: A novel transformer-based MoE framework integrates aMRI, DTI, fMRI, and clinical data, using modality-specific experts and adaptive fusion for feature extraction.

Result: The framework achieves 82.47% validation accuracy, outperforming baselines by over 10%.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves ND diagnosis by effectively leveraging multi-modal data, demonstrating real-world clinical potential.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (DenseNet-121) is developed to classify 8 body mpMRI series types, achieving high accuracy (0.972) and performing well on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorrect DICOM headers in mpMRI exams due to diverse protocols and technologist errors hinder radiologists' efficiency, necessitating an automated classification solution.

Method: Multiple deep learning classifiers (ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet) are trained on mpMRI data from various institutions to classify 8 series types, with performance compared and best model (DenseNet-121) evaluated under different training data quantities and external datasets.

Result: DenseNet-121 achieves the highest F1-score (0.966) and accuracy (0.972), performs well with over 729 training studies, and maintains accuracy (0.872, 0.810) on external datasets (DLDS, CPTAC-UCEC).

Conclusion: The DenseNet-121 model effectively classifies mpMRI series types, improving radiologists' workflow efficiency and demonstrating robustness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

*Jonghun Kim, Gyeongdeok Jo, Shinyoung Ra, Hyunjin Park*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed an HE inference framework for medical images using VQGAN for compression and polynomial approximations for activation functions, balancing privacy, efficiency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of HE inference for large medical images while ensuring privacy protection.

Method: Uses VQGAN for image compression, polynomial approximations for activation functions, and adapts squeeze and excitation modules for HE compatibility.

Result: Achieved optimal balance with 8x downsampling, showing practical potential despite minor performance differences vs. unencrypted inference.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong potential for privacy-preserving medical image analysis, though HE remains slower.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Accurate and timely stroke detection is critical for effective treatment and
improved patient outcomes in neuroimaging. While Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) are widely used for medical image analysis, their computational
complexity often hinders deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings.
In contrast, our approach combines Wavelet Transform with a compact MLP to
achieve efficient and accurate stroke classification. Using the "Brain Stroke

robustness and integrating additional MRI modalities for comprehensive stroke
assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative medical image analysis while preserving patient privacy and handling heterogeneous computational resources in federated learning for WSI classification.

Method: Proposes FedWSIDD, a federated learning paradigm using dataset distillation (DD) to transmit synthetic slides instead of model parameters, incorporating stain normalization for histopathology datasets.

Result: FedWSIDD enhances local WSI classification performance, offers flexibility for heterogeneous models, and preserves privacy, validated on CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 datasets.

Conclusion: FedWSIDD is an effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks, balancing performance, privacy, and computational flexibility.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is
available at FedWSIDD.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses noise issues in ultra-compact analog image sensors for single-use endoscopes, proposing a hybrid denoising system combining traditional and learning-based techniques to improve image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-use endoscopes with tiny sensors reduce costs and infection risks but suffer from noise due to limited photosensitive area, analog signal transmission, and simplified circuits.

Method: Developed a noise model for analog sensors and proposed a hybrid denoising system integrating traditional and learning-based techniques.

Result: The system reduces noise without detail loss, achieves real-time performance on FPGA, and improves PSNR from 21.16 to 33.05.

Conclusion: The hybrid denoising system effectively addresses noise in endoscopic images, enhancing diagnostic quality while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid PMD-CLAHE technique enhances CNN performance for cervical cancer classification, offering a new approach to improve early detection.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer

*Zijie Wang, Ryuichi Umehara, Mitsuhiro Nakamura, Megumi Nakao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A MeshVAE-based organ shape atlas is proposed for clinical applications, achieving accurate reconstruction of liver and stomach shapes with hierarchical latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of linear and conventional nonlinear models in representing complex organ shapes with large local variations, deep learning is explored for 3D shape representation.

Method: The study uses a mesh variational autoencoder (MeshVAE) with hierarchical latent variables and templates for vertex correspondence to represent and control organ shapes.

Result: The model reconstructed liver and stomach shapes with high accuracy (average vertex distances of 1.5 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively) and demonstrated hierarchical feature separation.

Conclusion: The proposed MeshVAE method effectively represents and controls organ shapes hierarchically, outperforming PCA in feature separation and interpolation.

Abstract: An organ shape atlas, which represents the shape and position of the organs
and skeleton of a living body using a small number of parameters, is expected
to have a wide range of clinical applications, including intraoperative
guidance and radiotherapy. Because the shape and position of soft organs vary
greatly among patients, it is difficult for linear models to reconstruct shapes
that have large local variations. Because it is difficult for conventional
nonlinear models to control and interpret the organ shapes obtained, deep
learning has been attracting attention in three-dimensional shape
representation. In this study, we propose an organ shape atlas based on a mesh
variational autoencoder (MeshVAE) with hierarchical latent variables. To
represent the complex shapes of biological organs and nonlinear shape
differences between individuals, the proposed method maintains the performance
of organ shape reconstruction by hierarchizing latent variables and enables
shape representation using lower-dimensional latent variables. Additionally,
templates that define vertex correspondence between different resolutions
enable hierarchical representation in mesh data and control the global and
local features of the organ shape. We trained the model using liver and stomach
organ meshes obtained from 124 cases and confirmed that the model reconstructed
the position and shape with an average distance between vertices of 1.5 mm and
mean distance of 0.7 mm for the liver shape, and an average distance between
vertices of 1.4 mm and mean distance of 0.8 mm for the stomach shape on test
data from 19 of cases. The proposed method continuously represented
interpolated shapes, and by changing latent variables at different hierarchical
levels, the proposed method hierarchically separated shape features compared
with PCA.

*Syed Haider Ali, Asrar Ahmad, Muhammad Ali, Asifullah Khan, Muhammad Shahban, Nadeem Shaukat*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study focuses on improving tumor segmentation in MRI datasets using a hybrid UNet-Transformer model, tailored for local hospital data under privacy constraints, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets lack heterogeneity for local patient populations, necessitating research on local datasets to integrate AI models into hospital workflows for accurate oncology treatment.

Method: Developed a hybrid UNet-Transformer model with attention modules, trained on 6080 local MRI images using data augmentation and pretrained weights, optimized for computational efficiency.

Result: Achieved a Dice score of 0.764 and IoU of 0.736, showing competitive performance despite limited data.

Conclusion: Site-specific model development is crucial for clinical deployment, highlighting the importance of local data and efficient architectures.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

### [423] [ATFusion: An Alternate Cross-Attention Transformer Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11675)
*Han Yan, Songlei Xiong, Long Wang, Lihua Jian, Gemine Vivone*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATFusion, a Transformer-based network for fusing infrared and visible images, addressing limitations in extracting discrepancy information and improving fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based fusion methods overlook discrepancy information, limiting performance. The paper aims to enhance fusion by reevaluating cross-attention mechanisms.

Method: Proposes ATFusion with a discrepancy information injection module (DIIM) and alternate common information injection modules (ACIIM), trained using a segmented pixel loss function.

Result: ATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations on public datasets.

Conclusion: ATFusion effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, offering superior fusion performance for infrared and visible images.

Abstract: The fusion of infrared and visible images is essential in remote sensing
applications, as it combines the thermal information of infrared images with
the detailed texture of visible images for more accurate analysis in tasks like
environmental monitoring, target detection, and disaster management. The
current fusion methods based on Transformer techniques for infrared and visible
(IV) images have exhibited promising performance. However, the attention
mechanism of the previous Transformer-based methods was prone to extract common
information from source images without considering the discrepancy information,
which limited fusion performance. In this paper, by reevaluating the
cross-attention mechanism, we propose an alternate Transformer fusion network
(ATFusion) to fuse IV images. Our ATFusion consists of one discrepancy
information injection module (DIIM) and two alternate common information
injection modules (ACIIM). The DIIM is designed by modifying the vanilla
cross-attention mechanism, which can promote the extraction of the discrepancy
information of the source images. Meanwhile, the ACIIM is devised by
alternately using the vanilla cross-attention mechanism, which can fully mine
common information and integrate long dependencies. Moreover, the successful
training of ATFusion is facilitated by a proposed segmented pixel loss
function, which provides a good trade-off for texture detail and salient
structure preservation. The qualitative and quantitative results on public
datasets indicate our ATFusion is effective and superior compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

*Omer F. Atli, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Arda C. Demirtas, Mahmut Yurt, Onat Dalmaz, Tolga Çukur*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: I2I-Mamba, a novel multi-modal medical image synthesis method, leverages dual-domain Mamba blocks and spiral-scan SSM operators to capture contextual features effectively, outperforming CNNs, transformers, and SSMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CNNs and transformers) struggle with balancing local precision and long-range context sensitivity in multi-modal medical image synthesis.

Method: I2I-Mamba uses hybrid residual architecture with dual-domain Mamba (ddMamba) blocks for contextual modeling in image and Fourier domains, employing spiral-scan SSM operators for enhanced radial coverage.

Result: I2I-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs, transformers, and SSMs in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols.

Conclusion: I2I-Mamba effectively addresses the trade-offs in contextual feature capture, offering superior performance in multi-modal medical image synthesis.

Abstract: Multi-modal medical image synthesis involves nonlinear transformation of
tissue signals between source and target modalities, where tissues exhibit
contextual interactions across diverse spatial distances. As such, the utility
of a network architecture in synthesis depends on its ability to express these
contextual features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer high local
precision at the expense of poor sensitivity to long-range context. While
transformers promise to alleviate this issue, they suffer from an unfavorable
trade-off between sensitivity to long- versus short-range context due to the
intrinsic complexity of attention filters. To effectively capture contextual
features while avoiding the complexity-driven trade-offs, here we introduce a
novel multi-modal synthesis method, I2I-Mamba, based on the state space
modeling (SSM) framework. Focusing on semantic representations across a hybrid
residual architecture, I2I-Mamba leverages novel dual-domain Mamba (ddMamba)
blocks for complementary contextual modeling in image and Fourier domains,
while maintaining spatial precision with convolutional layers. Diverting from
conventional raster-scan trajectories, ddMamba leverages novel SSM operators
based on a spiral-scan trajectory to learn context with enhanced radial
coverage and angular isotropy, and a channel-mixing layer to aggregate context
across the channel dimension. Comprehensive demonstrations on multi-contrast
MRI and MRI-CT protocols indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance
against state-of-the-art CNNs, transformers and SSMs.

*Yodai Suzuki, Ryosuke Isono, Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees is proposed, addressing limitations of existing PnP methods by integrating primal-dual splitting (PDS) for broader applicability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PnP methods lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions, leading to inconsistent behavior and high computational costs for non-quadratic data-fidelity terms.

Method: The paper integrates PnP with primal-dual splitting (PDS) to develop a convergent framework, establishing theoretical conditions for convergence and handling general monotone inclusion problems.

Result: The proposed PnP algorithm efficiently solves a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed convergence, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides a general and theoretically sound PnP framework for image restoration, overcoming limitations of ad-hoc methods and ensuring practical effectiveness.

Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical
convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance
in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying
Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical
convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature,
resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees
are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a
considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms
and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration
scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with
primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for
solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general
convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for
the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption.
Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is
not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone
inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the
solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image
restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical
experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and
effectiveness of our theoretical results.

*Chengming Liu, Fengjie Wang, Lei Shi, Zhe Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synergy Scoring Filter (SSFilter), a fully unsupervised anomaly detection method that improves performance and scalability by leveraging sample-level filtering and robust training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for noise-inclusive fully unsupervised anomaly detection (FUAD) are limited in performance and scalability, prompting the need for a more adaptable solution.

Method: SSFilter integrates batch-level anomaly scoring, mutual patch comparison, regression errors, and prediction uncertainty to estimate sample-level uncertainty scores. It also includes anomaly synthesis and integrity enhancement for robust training.

Result: SSFilter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Real-IAD dataset and enhances other UAD methods through dataset-level filtering.

Conclusion: SSFilter offers a scalable, model-agnostic solution for FUAD, significantly improving practical applicability and performance.

Abstract: Noise-inclusive fully unsupervised anomaly detection (FUAD) holds significant
practical relevance. Although various methods exist to address this problem,
they are limited in both performance and scalability. Our work seeks to
overcome these obstacles, enabling broader adaptability of unsupervised anomaly
detection (UAD) models to FUAD. To achieve this, we introduce the Synergy
Scoring Filter (SSFilter), the first fully unsupervised anomaly detection
approach to leverage sample-level filtering. SSFilter facilitates end-to-end
robust training and applies filtering to the complete training set
post-training, offering a model-agnostic solution for FUAD. Specifically,
SSFilter integrates a batch-level anomaly scoring mechanism based on mutual
patch comparison and utilizes regression errors in anomalous regions, alongside
prediction uncertainty, to estimate sample-level uncertainty scores that
calibrate the anomaly scoring mechanism. This design produces a synergistic,
robust filtering approach. Furthermore, we propose a realistic anomaly
synthesis method and an integrity enhancement strategy to improve model
training and mitigate missed noisy samples. Our method establishes
state-of-the-art performance on the FUAD benchmark of the recent large-scale
industrial anomaly detection dataset, Real-IAD. Additionally, dataset-level
filtering enhances the performance of various UAD methods on the FUAD
benchmark, and the high scalability of our approach significantly boosts its
practical applicability.

TL;DR: Ophora is an AI model generating ophthalmic surgical videos from natural language instructions, addressing data scarcity and privacy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in collecting annotated ophthalmic surgical videos due to privacy and labor constraints motivates the use of text-guided video generation (T2V).

Method: Ophora uses a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to create a dataset (Ophora-160K) and a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to adapt a T2V model for surgical video generation.

Result: Ophora generates realistic and reliable surgical videos, validated by quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback, and aids in surgical workflow understanding.

Conclusion: Ophora successfully addresses data scarcity in ophthalmic surgery through AI-generated videos, demonstrating practical utility for downstream tasks.

Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting
surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous
ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult
to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video
generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by
generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this
paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic
surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora,
we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative
ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising
over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive
Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge
from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for
privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K.
Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and
ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and
reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also
validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic
surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at

Conclusion: PRO demonstrates versatility and scalability for CT data augmentation, highlighting projection domain synthesis's potential.

Abstract: Synthesizing high quality CT projection data remains a significant challenge
due to the limited availability of annotated data and the complex nature of CT
imaging. In this work, we present PRO, a projection domain synthesis foundation
model for CT imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that performs CT synthesis in the projection domain. Unlike previous approaches

synthesis. This projection domain strategy enables more faithful modeling of
underlying imaging physics and anatomical structures. Moreover, PRO functions
as a foundation model, capable of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks
by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results
demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves

sparse-view reconstruction. These findings underscore the versatility and
scalability of PRO in data generation for various CT applications. These
results highlight the potential of projection domain synthesis as a powerful
tool for data augmentation and robust CT imaging. Our source code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PRO.
