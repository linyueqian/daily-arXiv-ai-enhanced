### [1] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen, Sajjadur Rahman, Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark (LUCARIO) and framework for probabilistic QA over tabular data, combining Bayesian Networks and LLMs, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems (e.g., NL2SQL) struggle with probabilistic questions requiring uncertainty reasoning.

Method: Induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and uses LLMs for answer generation.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements over baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances probabilistic QA, addressing limitations of current systems.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [2] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale, Inioluwa Deborah Raji, Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques static benchmarks for evaluating multi-lingual competence in LLMs and introduces functional benchmarks (CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval) translated into five languages. Results show varying performance drops between static and functional benchmarks, with robustness differing across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks (e.g., Belebele, M-MMLU, M-GSM) inadequately assess practical performance and robustness of multi-lingual LLMs. Functional benchmarks are needed for better evaluation.

Method: Created functional benchmarks (CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval) by translating existing English templates into French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Yoruba. Evaluated performance and robustness across these languages.

Result: Performance drops between static and functional benchmarks vary (e.g., 24% for M-GSM vs. CL-GSM Symbolic in English). Robustness differs by language, with Arabic and English performing most consistently.

Conclusion: Functional benchmarks provide deeper insights into multi-lingual LLM performance and robustness, highlighting limitations of static benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [3] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated research ideas initially seem more novel than human ideas, but their execution leads to worse outcomes, closing the novelty gap and revealing limitations in LLMs for effective research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI-generated research ideas lead to better research outcomes when executed, compared to human-expert ideas.

Method: An execution study with 43 expert researchers implementing randomly assigned LLM or human ideas, followed by blind reviews of the resulting short papers.

Result: LLM-generated ideas scored significantly worse post-execution on novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall metrics (p < 0.05), reversing initial rankings.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to generate truly effective research ideas, and evaluating ideas without execution is challenging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

### [4] [MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20821)
*Chinmay Gondhalekar, Urjitkumar Patel, Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG is a multimodal RAG framework for financial QA, improving accuracy over ChatGPT-4o by 19 percentage points by integrating text, tables, and images with efficient retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial documents combine diverse modalities (text, tables, figures), challenging traditional LLMs and RAG pipelines due to token limits and fragmented context.

Method: MultiFinRAG uses a lightweight multimodal LLM for extraction, embeds outputs with modality-aware thresholds, and employs a tiered fallback strategy for cross-modal reasoning.

Result: Achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o on complex financial QA tasks.

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG effectively addresses multimodal challenges in financial QA, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

### [5] [Prompt-Guided Turn-Taking Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21191)
*Koji Inoue, Mikey Elmers, Yahui Fu, Zi Haur Pang, Divesh Lala, Keiko Ochi, Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel transformer-based model for turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems, dynamically controlled via textual prompts like 'faster' or 'calmer', improves accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems by enabling dynamic, intuitive control through textual prompts.

Method: Extends a transformer-based voice activity projection model by integrating textual prompt embeddings into channel-wise and cross-channel transformers. Synthetic prompts were generated using an LLM.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy and adaptable turn-taking timing behaviors based on textual prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively combines textual prompts with transformer architectures for dynamic turn-taking control in conversational systems.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

### [6] [Uncovering Hidden Violent Tendencies in LLMs: A Demographic Analysis via Behavioral Vignettes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20822)
*Quintin Myers, Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' ability to handle morally ambiguous violent content using the VBVQ, revealing discrepancies in their responses compared to human behavior and biases across demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine LLMs' reasoning in morally ambiguous scenarios and assess potential biases in their responses to violent content.

Method: Evaluated six LLMs using the VBVQ with persona-based prompting (varying race, age, and geography) in a zero-shot setting.

Result: LLMs' surface-level responses often misalign with their internal violent tendencies, and their biases contradict established social science findings.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit biases and inconsistencies in handling violent content, highlighting the need for further scrutiny and alignment with human norms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

### [7] [Decide less, communicate more: On the construct validity of end-to-end fact-checking in medicine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20876)
*Sebastian Joseph, Lily Chen, Barry Wei, Michael Mackert, Iain J. Marshall, Paul Pu Liang, Ramez Kouzy, Byron C. Wallace, Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges of applying automated fact-checking systems in medicine, highlighting issues like connecting claims to clinical trials, ambiguous claims, and subjective veracity labels. It suggests treating fact-checking as an interactive communication problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high-stakes nature of medical decisions and the inadequacy of medical literacy among users motivate the need for automated fact-checking systems in medicine.

Method: The study examines how clinical experts verify real social media claims by synthesizing medical evidence, identifying challenges in end-to-end fact-checking.

Result: Key challenges include difficulties linking claims to clinical trials, ambiguous claims, and subjective veracity labels.

Conclusion: Fact-checking in medicine should be approached as an interactive communication problem, not an end-to-end process.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

### [8] [Aligning Spoken Dialogue Models from User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21463)
*Anne Wu, Laurent Mazaré, Neil Zeghidour, Alexandre Défossez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns preferences for spoken dialogue models using real-time speech interactions, improving factual accuracy, safety, and contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods are text-based and inadequate for real-time speech interactions, which involve richer dynamics like interruptions and lack explicit turn segmentation.

Method: A large-scale dataset of 150,000 preference pairs from multi-turn speech conversations is created, annotated with AI feedback. Offline alignment methods finetune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model.

Result: Feedback on generic conversations effectively improves spoken dialogue models. Human evaluations confirm the model's enhanced performance in multi-turn interactions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for balancing various dynamics in real-time speech dialogue systems to achieve natural interactions.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [9] [Optimising Language Models for Downstream Tasks: A Post-Training Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20917)
*Zhengyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve language model adaptation, including continued pre-training, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and enhanced supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating improved robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in adapting large language models efficiently and robustly to specific tasks, such as underutilizing unlabelled data, overfitting, and high computational costs.

Method: Continued pre-training for unlabelled data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, improved supervised fine-tuning, and new evaluation benchmarks.

Result: Substantial improvements in robustness, efficiency, and generalization across diverse NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance language model adaptability, contributing to more robust and efficient models, moving closer to artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

### [10] [FineWeb2: One Pipeline to Scale Them All -- Adapting Pre-Training Data Processing to Every Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20920)
*Guilherme Penedo, Hynek Kydlíček, Vinko Sabolčec, Bettina Messmer, Negar Foroutan, Amir Hossein Kargaran, Colin Raffel, Martin Jaggi, Leandro Von Werra, Thomas Wolf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilingual pre-training dataset curation pipeline, FineWeb2, addressing challenges in filtering and deduplication for diverse languages, and demonstrates its effectiveness through evaluations and scaling to 1000+ languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training multilingual LLMs is challenging due to the lack of high-quality, diverse datasets tailored for multiple languages. Existing pipelines struggle with filtering and deduplication across languages.

Method: The authors propose an adaptable pipeline for dataset curation, evaluate it on nine languages, and introduce a rebalancing approach considering duplication and quality. They scale it to create FineWeb2, a 20TB multilingual dataset.

Result: The pipeline produces more performant models than prior datasets, with additional gains from the rebalancing approach. FineWeb2 is released as a 20TB dataset covering 1000+ languages.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable, adaptable solution for multilingual dataset curation, improving model performance and releasing a large, high-quality dataset (FineWeb2) with associated tools.

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

### [11] [KaLM-Embedding-V2: Superior Training Techniques and Data Inspire A Versatile Embedding Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20923)
*Xinping Zhao, Xinshuo Hu, Zifei Shan, Shouzheng Huang, Yao Zhou, Zetian Sun, Zhenyu Liu, Dongfang Li, Xinyuan Wei, Qian Chen, Youcheng Pan, Yang Xiang, Meishan Zhang, Haofen Wang, Jun Yu, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KaLM-Embedding-V2 is a compact embedding model with superior performance, leveraging bidirectional transformers, multi-stage training, and innovative techniques like focal-style reweighting and hard-negative mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile and compact embedding model that outperforms larger models while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Uses bidirectional transformers, mean-pooling, multi-stage training (pre-training, fine-tuning, model-soup), focal-style reweighting, and hard-negative mixing.

Result: Significantly outperforms comparable models and competes with much larger ones on MTEB benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sets a new standard for compact embedding models with under 1B parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

### [12] [Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20989)
*Eric Zhang, Leshem Choshen, Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether fine-tuning can emulate prompting in language models, proposing a meta-training method where gradient updates mimic prompting effects, showing promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the effectiveness of prompting and the storage efficiency of fine-tuning in language models.

Method: Meta-training LMs using gradient-based meta-learning, using the LM's own prompted predictions as targets instead of ground-truth labels.

Result: Fine-tuning with this method recovers some or all of the prompted model's performance, improving tasks like the 'reversal curse' and answering questions after a single update.

Conclusion: Gradient descent can be expressive with proper initialization, offering insights for long-context modeling and generalization in gradient-based learning.

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

### [13] [SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs with Dynamic Intensity Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20993)
*Adithya Chittem, Aishna Shrivastava, Sai Tarun Pendela, Jagat Sesh Challa, Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to the 16PF model for finer personality control in LLMs, introduces SAC for dynamic trait intensity, and shows improved consistency and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing LLM personality models, which rely on coarse Big Five dimensions and lack trait intensity control.

Method: Extend MPI to 16PF model, develop SAC framework with adjective-based semantic anchoring and five intensity factors for dynamic trait control.

Result: Continuous intensity modelling improves consistency and controllability; trait changes influence related traits coherently.

Conclusion: Enables nuanced human-machine interactions in healthcare, education, and more, advancing human-like social machines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

TL;DR: CA-Ben, a benchmark for LLMs in financial and legal reasoning, evaluates six models in the Indian financial context, revealing performance variations and challenges in numerical and legal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the uncertainty of LLMs' domain-specific financial knowledge, particularly in the Indian financial context, by introducing a specialized benchmark.

Method: CA-Ben uses structured QA datasets from ICAI exams to evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1 405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Microsoft Phi 4) using standardized protocols.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o performed best, especially in conceptual and legal reasoning, but challenges arose in numerical computations and legal interpretations.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' strengths and limitations, suggesting hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation for future improvements in quantitative and legal tasks.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

### [15] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan, Chong Zhang, Zheng Fang, Ming Pang, Xue Jiang, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin, Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSUF, a semi-supervised scalable unified framework for e-commerce query classification, addressing issues like insufficient prior information and lack of a unified framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce queries are short and lack context, and existing methods rely on posterior click behavior, creating a vicious cycle. Subtasks also lack a unified framework.

Method: SSUF includes knowledge-enhanced, label-enhanced, and structure-enhanced modules to unify tasks, enhance representations, and reduce dependency on posterior labels.

Result: SSUF outperforms state-of-the-art models in offline and online A/B experiments.

Conclusion: SSUF effectively addresses the challenges of e-commerce query classification with its modular and scalable design.

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

### [16] [MT2-CSD: A New Dataset and Multi-Semantic Knowledge Fusion Method for Conversational Stance Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21053)
*Fuqiang Niu, Genan Dai, Yisha Lu, Jiayu Liao, Xiang Li, Hu Huang, Bowen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MT2-CSD, a large dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational stance detection, and proposes LLM-CRAN, a model leveraging LLMs to improve performance, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stance detection lacks datasets capturing real social media dynamics, limiting advancements in conversational stance detection.

Method: Proposes LLM-CRAN, a model using LLMs for conversational understanding, tested on the MT2-CSD dataset.

Result: LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms baseline models in conversational stance detection.

Conclusion: The MT2-CSD dataset and LLM-CRAN model advance conversational stance detection, addressing previous limitations.

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

*Papa Séga Wade, Mihai Andries, Ioannis Kanellos, Thierry Moudenc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A chunk-based approach using self-supervised learning models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM) with a CNN-BiLSTM framework improves fluency assessment in non-native speech, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) struggles with capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers.

Method: Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero-VAD. SSL embeddings are fused via a weighted mechanism, enriched with fluency markers, and processed by CNN-BiLSTM for local and long-term dependencies.

Result: Improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points on Speechocean762, and 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo, surpassing baselines.

Conclusion: Chunk-based multi-SSL fusion is effective for robust fluency evaluation, but future work should address dialects with irregular prosody.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

### [18] [DALR: Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21096)
*Kang He, Yuzhe Ding. Haining Wang, Fei Li, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DALR improves multimodal sentence representation by addressing cross-modal misalignment and intra-modal divergence through fine-grained alignment and ranking distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align images and text coarsely, suffering from cross-modal misalignment and intra-modal divergence, degrading representation quality.

Method: DALR uses consistency learning for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and integrates ranking distillation with intra-modal alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on STS and TR tasks.

Conclusion: DALR effectively enhances multimodal sentence representation by addressing alignment challenges.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComRAG is a retrieval-augmented framework for real-time industrial CQA, integrating static knowledge and dynamic historical QA pairs with a centroid-based memory mechanism, outperforming baselines in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CQA platforms underutilize external knowledge, lack dynamic historical context, or have inefficient memory mechanisms for industrial use.

Method: Proposes ComRAG, a framework combining static knowledge and dynamic historical QA pairs using a centroid-based memory mechanism for retrieval, generation, and storage.

Result: ComRAG achieves up to 25.9% improvement in vector similarity, reduces latency by 8.7%-23.3%, and lowers chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06%.

Conclusion: ComRAG effectively addresses challenges in industrial CQA by integrating knowledge and dynamic context, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

*Xiaoshuang Ji, Zhendong Zhao, Xiaojun Chen, Xin Zhao, Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progtuning is a progressive fine-tuning framework for Transformer models, reducing updated parameters by ~25% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiency in fine-tuning by reducing unnecessary parameter updates in Transformer blocks.

Method: Progressively reduces updated Transformer blocks based on contribution, optimizing resource allocation.

Result: Reduces parameters by ~25% with competitive performance and adapts well to parameter-efficient methods.

Conclusion: Progtuning efficiently optimizes fine-tuning for large models, balancing performance and resource use.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

*Viacheslav Meshchaninov, Egor Chimbulatov, Alexander Shabalin, Aleksandr Abramov, Dmitry Vetrov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cosmos introduces a compressed latent space for text generation using diffusion models, offering faster inference and better coherence compared to autoregressive and token-level diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are slow and struggle with global coherence, while token-level diffusion models face high dimensionality issues. Cosmos aims to address these limitations.

Method: Cosmos uses a compressed latent space learned via an autoencoder trained for token-level reconstruction and alignment with a pretrained language encoder.

Result: Cosmos compresses text representations by 8×, matches or surpasses baseline models in quality, and offers 2× faster inference.

Conclusion: Cosmos is a promising alternative for text generation, combining efficiency, quality, and flexibility.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

*Yongchan Chun, Minhyuk Kim, Dongjun Kim, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a retrieval-based prompting strategy for Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) using syntactic similarity in few-shot settings, improving F1-scores on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are underutilized for ATE, and existing methods rely on semantic similarity, which may not capture term boundaries effectively.

Method: A retrieval-based prompting strategy selects demonstrations based on syntactic similarity, evaluated in in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Result: Syntactic retrieval improves F1-score on three specialized ATE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Syntactic cues are crucial for adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

### [24] [Agent-RewardBench: Towards a Unified Benchmark for Reward Modeling across Perception, Planning, and Safety in Real-World Multimodal Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21252)
*Tianyi Men, Zhuoran Jin, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RewardBench is a benchmark to evaluate reward modeling in MLLMs, addressing limitations in self-correction and generalization for multimodal agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal agents lack external feedback for self-correction and generalization, necessitating a standardized way to evaluate reward models.

Method: Agent-RewardBench evaluates reward models across multiple dimensions (perception, planning, safety) in 7 real-world scenarios, with step-level granularity and controlled difficulty.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs show limited performance, indicating the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling.

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench fills a critical gap in evaluating reward models for multimodal agents, paving the way for improved agent capabilities.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at
github.

*Andrea McGlinchey, Peter J Barclay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether increasingly large language models (LLMs) will outpace detectors of fake text, finding that while newer models like Gemini improve deception, simpler classifiers remain effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if the escalating scale of LLMs will make fake text undetectable, focusing on whether detection can remain feasible despite model growth.

Method: Examined the performance of statistical classifiers in detecting fake text, specifically in classical detective fiction style, comparing models like Gemini and GPT over version updates.

Result: Gemini showed improved deception over a 0.5 version increase, while GPT did not, indicating detection may stay viable even as models grow.

Conclusion: Reliable fake text detection may remain feasible for larger models, though new architectures could enhance deception.

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Double-Checker enhances slow-thinking LLMs by enabling iterative self-critique and refinement, improving reasoning performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current slow-thinking LLMs lack effective self-critique and refinement capabilities, limiting their reasoning potential.

Method: Introduces Double-Checker, a framework for iterative self-critique and refinement, fine-tuned on 1,730 curated instances.

Result: Improves pass@1 performance on AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2%.

Conclusion: Double-Checker offers a promising approach to develop more trustworthy and effective LLMs with structured self-critique.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

*Istabrak Abbes, Gabriele Prato, Quentin Fournier, Fernando Rodriguez, Alaa Boukhary, Adam Elwood, Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lightweight encoder models like RoBERTa and NomicBERT can detect groundedness in queries for LLMs as effectively as state-of-the-art LLMs, reducing latency and resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate ungrounded responses when context lacks information, harming factual consistency and trustworthiness. Detecting groundedness before answer generation can save resources.

Method: Fine-tuned lightweight encoder models (RoBERTa, NomicBERT) on curated datasets to detect groundedness in queries.

Result: Achieved accuracy comparable to Llama3 8B and GPT4o while significantly reducing inference latency.

Conclusion: Task-specific encoder models offer a resource-efficient alternative to LLMs for groundedness detection, improving reliability and performance.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

*Bram Willemsen, Gabriel Skantze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A text-only autoregressive language model is used to extract referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue, showing effectiveness despite limitations of unimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if linguistic context alone can detect mentions with visual referents in dialogue.

Method: Adapt a pretrained LLM for coarse-grained mention span annotation via next-token prediction, using small datasets and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Text-only approach is effective, emphasizing linguistic context's importance, but the task remains inherently multimodal.

Conclusion: While text-only methods work, multimodal approaches are essential due to the task's inherent nature.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

TL;DR: GLASS (Greimas Literary Analysis via Semiotic Square) enhances LLMs' literary criticism by using Greimas Semiotic Square, achieving high performance compared to expert analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with in-depth literary criticism for complex works. GLASS aims to bridge this gap by providing a structured framework.

Method: Proposes GLASS, a GSS-based framework, and a dataset of 48 works. Uses LLM-as-a-judge for quantitative metrics.

Result: GLASS outperforms expert criticism and produces high-quality analyses for 39 classic works.

Conclusion: GLASS offers a valuable AI tool for literary research and education, addressing cognitive mechanisms in literary engagement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-RAG improves RAG systems by handling noisy, ambiguous, and multi-intent queries through LLM-assisted preprocessing, intent-aware retrieval, and reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with noisy and complex real-world queries, often trained on cleaner data, limiting their effectiveness in live settings.

Method: Omni-RAG uses three modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, and (3) Reranking and Generation with LLMs and rerankers.

Result: The framework enhances robustness and effectiveness in open-domain RAG systems, addressing challenges like the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

Conclusion: Omni-RAG bridges the gap between RAG capabilities and real-world demands, improving performance for complex and noisy queries.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [31] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol, Garima Agrawal, Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLM framework improves fraud and concept drift detection in deceptive conversations by integrating structured insights with pretrained LLMs, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD) make detecting deceptive conversations challenging, requiring enhanced methods to address contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The framework combines pretrained LLMs with domain knowledge, featuring a DK-LLM module for fake conversation detection, a drift detection unit (OCDD), and another DK-LLM module to classify drift as benign or fraudulent.

Result: The system achieves 98% classification accuracy on fake conversations and effectively identifies drift types, outperforming zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness enhances performance, interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)\-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk\-sensitive scenarios. To
address these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)\-Enhanced LLM
framework that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task\-specific
insights to perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed
architecture consists of three main components: (1) a DK\-LLM module to detect
fake or deceptive conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine
whether a semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK\-LLM module to
classify the drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value
of domain knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full
framework to SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types
of fraud and spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake
conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of
drift. Guided by structured prompts, the LLaMA\-based implementation achieves
98\% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero\-shot baselines
demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness
significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness in
high\-stakes NLP applications.

### [32] [Text2Cypher Across Languages: Evaluating Foundational Models Beyond English](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21445)
*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy, William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across English, Spanish, and Turkish, revealing performance disparities due to training data and linguistic differences. Prompt translation has minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multilingual evaluation in Text2Cypher tasks and assess LLM performance across languages.

Method: Created a multilingual test set by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish, preserving Cypher queries. Evaluated models using standardized prompts and metrics.

Result: Performance was highest in English, followed by Spanish, and lowest in Turkish, attributed to training data and linguistic differences. Prompt translation had little impact.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for inclusive multilingual evaluation and development, suggesting future work in schema localization and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

### [33] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi, Tatsuro Inaba, Kentaro Inui, Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopK LMs, a modified transformer architecture with TopK activation, to address shortcomings of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in interpretability and feature stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs, used for analyzing transformer-based LMs, have limitations like unclear concept discovery and unstable features across checkpoints, reducing their utility.

Method: The authors modify the transformer architecture by incorporating a TopK activation function at selected layers, eliminating the need for post-hoc SAE training.

Result: TopK LMs maintain original capabilities while offering robust interpretability, enabling targeted neuron interventions and detailed analysis of neuron formation.

Conclusion: TopK LMs provide a stable, interpretable alternative to SAEs, advancing research on LM interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large language models show strong performance in online and semi-online regimes, outperforming offline methods, with similar results across variants like Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization. Multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable rewards improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in transitioning from offline to online regimes for finetuning large language models, comparing performance on verifiable and non-verifiable tasks.

Method: Experiments compare online and semi-online Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, analyzing training dynamics and hyperparameter selection. Multi-tasking with both reward types is also tested.

Result: Online and semi-online methods outperform offline ones, with similar performance across variants. Multi-tasking improves results for both task types.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning in online/semi-online regimes is highly effective for finetuning, with multi-tasking further enhancing performance.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

### [35] [Enhancing User Engagement in Socially-Driven Dialogue through Interactive LLM Alignments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21497)
*Jiashuo Wang, Kaitao Song, Chunpu Xu, Changhe Song, Yang Xiao, Dongsheng Li, Lili Qiu, Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance user engagement in socially-driven dialogues by aligning interactive LLMs with future conversation signals, using a user simulator and i×MCTS for data collection and DPO for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods focus on knowledge or dialogue acts but fail to guarantee user engagement. The paper addresses this gap by directly learning from user reactions to improve engagement.

Method: Uses a user simulator and i×MCTS to explore interactions, collects a dataset of high/low-quality experiences, and aligns LLMs via DPO.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively boosts user engagement in emotional support and persuasion dialogues.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs by leveraging future conversation signals and direct preference optimization.

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

new, original datasets tailored for Slovak and meticulously translated
established English NLU resources. Within this paper, we also present the first
systematic and extensive evaluation of a wide array of Slovak-specific,
multilingual, and English pre-trained language models using the skLEP tasks.
Finally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit
facilitating both fine-tuning and evaluation of models, and a public
leaderboard at https://github.com/slovak-nlp/sklep in the hopes of fostering
reproducibility and drive future research in Slovak NLU.

### [37] [Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21521)
*Marina Mancoridis, Bec Weeks, Keyon Vafa, Sendhil Mullainathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the validity of evaluating LLMs using benchmarks designed for humans, introducing a framework to detect 'potemkin understanding'—false comprehension based on non-human-like errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLM benchmark success reflects genuine understanding or misleading performance due to non-human-like errors.

Method: Introduces two procedures: a specially designed benchmark and a general method to quantify 'potemkin understanding' across models, tasks, and domains.

Result: Finds 'potemkins' (false understanding) are common in LLMs, revealing incoherent concept representations.

Conclusion: Benchmarks may mislead if LLM errors don't mirror human misunderstandings, highlighting deeper flaws in LLM comprehension.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HealthChat-11K, a dataset of 11K real-world conversations about healthcare with LLMs, analyzing user interactions across 21 health specialties to highlight risks and improve LLM healthcare support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users interact with LLMs for healthcare information and identify inherent risks like incomplete context and sycophancy.

Method: Curated HealthChat-11K dataset from large-scale conversational AI data, analyzed using a clinician-driven taxonomy across 21 health specialties.

Result: Revealed common interactions, incomplete context, affective behaviors, and sycophancy-inducing questions, showing the need for better LLM healthcare support.

Conclusion: LLMs in healthcare chatbots require improvements to address identified risks and enhance user interactions.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and
combine them into a curated dataset can be found here:

*Yalun Dai, Yangyu Huang, Xin Zhang, Wenshan Wu, Chong Li, Wenhui Lu, Shijie Cao, Li Dong, Scarlett Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Efficacy (DELT), a paradigm optimizing training data organization for language models, featuring components like Data Scoring (LQS) and Data Ordering (FO), validated by improved performance without extra data or model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of optimizing training data organization (Data Efficacy) alongside data efficiency for better language model performance.

Method: Proposes DELT with three components: Data Scoring (LQS), Data Selection, and Data Ordering (FO). LQS scores data by learnability and quality, while FO tackles model forgetting and bias.

Result: DELT improves LM performance without additional data or model size. LQS and FO combined yield the most significant gains. Data efficacy complements data efficiency.

Conclusion: Data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training, achievable alongside data efficiency.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

*Chenglong Wang, Hang Zhou, Kaiyan Chang, Tongran Liu, Chunliang Zhang, Quan Du, Tong Xiao, Yue Zhang, Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSEM, a three-stage method for training model-based evaluation metrics using large language models to generate labeled data, eliminating the need for human-labeled data. It supports diverse evaluation types and outperforms traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture semantic accuracy, and model-based metrics face data scarcity issues. CSEM addresses this by generating labeled data automatically.

Method: CSEM uses large language models to generate labeled data for training evaluation models, supporting single-aspect, multi-aspect, reference-free, and reference-based evaluations.

Result: CSEM effectively trains evaluation models without human-labeled data and outperforms traditional metrics in reinforcement learning and reranking tasks.

Conclusion: CSEM provides a scalable and customizable solution for sequence evaluation, improving sequence quality and reducing reliance on human-labeled data.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of sequence generation, traditionally reliant on metrics
like BLEU and ROUGE, often fails to capture the semantic accuracy of generated
text sequences due to their emphasis on n-gram overlap. A promising solution to
this problem is to develop model-based metrics, such as BLEURT and COMET.
However, these approaches are typically hindered by the scarcity of labeled
evaluation data, which is necessary to train the evaluation models. In this
work, we build upon this challenge by proposing the Customized Sequence
Evaluation Metric (CSEM), a three-stage evaluation model training method that
utilizes large language models to generate labeled data for model-based metric
development, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled data. Additionally,
we expand the scope of CSEM to support various evaluation types, including
single-aspect, multi-aspect, reference-free, and reference-based evaluations,
enabling the customization of metrics to suit diverse real-world scenarios.
Experimental results on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that CSEM can
effectively train an evaluation model without human-labeled data. Further
experiments in reinforcement learning and reranking show that metrics developed
through CSEM outperform traditional evaluation metrics, leading to substantial
improvements in sequence quality as evaluated by both commonly used metrics and
ChatGPT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MockLLM is a framework using LLMs to simulate mock interviews for better person-job matching, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recruitment methods lack dynamic interaction; LLMs offer potential for adaptive, role-based dialogues in recruitment.

Method: MockLLM generates mock interviews and evaluates them via a two-sided handshake protocol, incorporating reflection memory and dynamic strategy modification.

Result: MockLLM outperforms existing methods in matching accuracy, scalability, and adaptability on real-world data from Boss Zhipin.

Conclusion: MockLLM advances candidate assessment and online recruitment by enabling consistent, collaborative, and adaptive interactions.

Abstract: Online recruitment platforms have reshaped job-seeking and recruiting
processes, driving increased demand for applications that enhance person-job
matching. Traditional methods generally rely on analyzing textual data from
resumes and job descriptions, limiting the dynamic, interactive aspects crucial
to effective recruitment. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have
revealed remarkable potential in simulating adaptive, role-based dialogues,
making them well-suited for recruitment scenarios. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{MockLLM}, a novel framework to generate and evaluate mock interview
interactions. The system consists of two key components: mock interview
generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake protocol. By simulating both
interviewer and candidate roles, MockLLM enables consistent and collaborative
interactions for real-time and two-sided matching. To further improve the
matching quality, MockLLM further incorporates reflection memory generation and
dynamic strategy modification, refining behaviors based on previous experience.
We evaluate MockLLM on real-world data Boss Zhipin, a major Chinese recruitment
platform. The experimental results indicate that MockLLM outperforms existing
methods in matching accuracy, scalability, and adaptability across job domains,
highlighting its potential to advance candidate assessment and online
recruitment.

*Enzo Terreau, Antoine Gourru, Julien Velcin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VIB-based model to learn author and document embeddings with a stylistic focus, outperforming baselines in authorship attribution and capturing stylistic aspects better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack explicit writing style capture, limiting their use in literary data. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a VIB-based architecture, fine-tuning a pre-trained document encoder and incorporating predefined stylistic features for interpretable representations.

Result: Evaluated on three datasets (Gutenberg Project, Blog Authorship Corpus, IMDb62), the model matches or outperforms baselines in authorship attribution and better captures stylistic aspects.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively learns stylistic author and document embeddings, improving performance in authorship tasks and stylistic analysis.

Abstract: A wide range of Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) models integrates
continuous and low dimensional representations of words and documents.
Surprisingly, very few models study representation learning for authors. These
representations can be used for many NLP tasks, such as author identification
and classification, or in recommendation systems. A strong limitation of
existing works is that they do not explicitly capture writing style, making
them hardly applicable to literary data. We therefore propose a new
architecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) that learns
embeddings for both authors and documents with a stylistic constraint. Our
model fine-tunes a pre-trained document encoder. We stimulate the detection of
writing style by adding predefined stylistic features making the representation
axis interpretable with respect to writing style indicators. We evaluate our
method on three datasets: a literary corpus extracted from the Gutenberg
Project, the Blog Authorship Corpus and IMDb62, for which we show that it
matches or outperforms strong/recent baselines in authorship attribution while
capturing much more accurately the authors stylistic aspects.

*Alireza Salemi, Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as an alternative to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for personalizing LLMs, showing combined methods yield the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited exploration of privacy-preserving methods for LLM personalization beyond RAG.

Method: Systematic study comparing RAG and PEFT for LLM personalization across seven datasets.

Result: Combining RAG and PEFT improves performance by 15.98%, with PEFT benefiting from more user data.

Conclusion: PEFT is effective with ample user data, while RAG suits cold-start users; integration of both enhances personalization.

Abstract: Despite its substantial impact on various search, recommendation, and
question answering tasks, privacy-preserving methods for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) have received relatively limited exploration. There is
one primary approach in this area through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
which generates personalized outputs by enriching the input prompt with
information retrieved from the user's personal data. This paper studies an
orthogonal approach to RAG that involves learning user-dependent LLM parameters
through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents the first
systematic study for exploration of PEFT for LLM personalization and provides
an extensive comparisons between RAG- and PEFT-based solutions, across a broad
set of seven diverse datasets from the LaMP benchmark. Our results demonstrate
that, on average, both RAG- and PEFT-based personalization methods yield 14.92%
and 1.07% improvements over non-personalized LLMs, respectively. When combining
RAG with PEFT, we observe a further improvement of 15.98%, highlighting the
effectiveness of their integration in enhancing personalized text generation.
Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between the amount of user
data available and the effectiveness of PEFT. This finding suggests that RAG is
particularly beneficial for cold-start users -- users with limited personal
data -- while PEFT performs better when more user-specific data is available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified search engine is designed for multiple RAG agents, optimized iteratively using feedback to personalize retrieval, outperforming baselines in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of serving diverse RAG agents with distinct tasks, LLMs, and strategies by optimizing retrieval quality.

Method: An iterative expectation-maximization algorithm optimizes the search engine using offline feedback, adapted for real-time online refinement.

Result: Outperforms baselines across 18 RAG models on KILT benchmark datasets, showing effective personalization.

Conclusion: The method successfully personalizes retrieval for each RAG agent, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of a unified search engine to serve
multiple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, each with a distinct
task, backbone large language model (LLM), and RAG strategy. We introduce an
iterative approach where the search engine generates retrieval results for the
RAG agents and gathers feedback on the quality of the retrieved documents
during an offline phase. This feedback is then used to iteratively optimize the
search engine using an expectation-maximization algorithm, with the goal of
maximizing each agent's utility function. Additionally, we adapt this to an
online setting, allowing the search engine to refine its behavior based on
real-time individual agents feedback to better serve the results for each of
them. Experiments on datasets from the Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks
(KILT) benchmark demonstrates that our approach significantly on average
outperforms baselines across 18 RAG models. We demonstrate that our method
effectively ``personalizes'' the retrieval for each RAG agent based on the
collected feedback. Finally, we provide a comprehensive ablation study to
explore various aspects of our method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TMCHT, a framework for evaluating multi-agent jailbreak attacks, and proposes ARCJ to address challenges like non-complete graph structures and large-scale systems, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks focus on multi-agent attacks with independent memory, a common real-world scenario.

Method: Proposes ARCJ, optimizing retrieval and replication suffixes to enhance attack effectiveness in multi-agent systems.

Result: ARCJ improves performance by 23.51%, 18.95%, and 52.93% in line, star, and 100-agent settings, respectively.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for community focus on multi-agent system security and demonstrates ARCJ's effectiveness.

Abstract: With the development of large language models, they are widely used as agents
in various fields. A key component of agents is memory, which stores vital
information but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainly
focuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-world
scenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose the
Troublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale,
multi-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHT
involves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents.
We identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graph
structure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to a
phenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we propose
an Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizes
the retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved and
optimizes the replication suffix to make poisoned samples have contagious
ability. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach in TMCHT, with 23.51%,
18.95%, and 52.93% improvements in line topology, star topology, and 100-agent
settings. Encourage community attention to the security of multi-agent systems.

*Xiao Xia, Dan Zhang, Zibo Liao, Zhenyu Hou, Tianrui Sun, Jing Li, Ling Fu, Yuxiao Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent, generates precise industrial scenes via C# code, achieving 81.0% success rate. Fine-tuning open-source LLMs with SceneInstruct dataset improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial scenes require precise measurements and spatial planning, challenging for general LLMs.

Method: SceneGenAgent uses structured C# code, layout verification, and iterative refinement for precise scene generation.

Result: 81.0% success rate in industrial scene generation; fine-tuned Llama3.1-70B approaches GPT-4o performance.

Conclusion: SceneGenAgent effectively addresses industrial scene generation challenges, with potential for broader LLM integration.

Abstract: The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial
manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant
progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating
industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for
precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial
arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an
LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent
ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format,
layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative
requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs
powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to
81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and
effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance
accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning

*Hoang H Nguyen, Khyati Mahajan, Vikas Yadav, Julian Salazar, Philip S. Yu, Masoud Hashemi, Rishabh Maheshwary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs underperform on non-Latin script languages due to Latin-dominated pretraining. Phonemic transcriptions are proposed to improve script-invariant representations, significantly closing the performance gap between Latin and non-Latin scripts. Mixed-ICL retrieval further boosts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the performance gap in multilingual LLMs for non-Latin script languages caused by Latin-dominated pretraining.

Method: Leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals and proposing Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy.

Result: Improved performance for both Latin (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin (up to 15.1%) script languages.

Conclusion: Phonemic signals and Mixed-ICL retrieval effectively enhance multilingual LLM performance, reducing script-based disparities.

Abstract: Although multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable performance across
benchmarks, we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages
across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that
LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin
characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We
propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce
script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating
phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin script
languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance
gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and
orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL).
This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further
aggregation from both leads to our significant performance improvements for
both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to
15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.

*Leitian Tao, Xiang Chen, Tong Yu, Tung Mai, Ryan Rossi, Yixuan Li, Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeLutra improves code generation in smaller LLMs by learning from both correct and incorrect code attempts, narrowing the gap with larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs are resource-heavy and over-generalize; fine-tuning smaller models is cost-effective but misses insights from failures.

Method: CodeLutra uses iterative preference-based refinement, comparing successful and failed outputs to refine results.

Result: On a data science task, Llama-3-8B's accuracy improved from 28.2% to 48.6% with just 500 samples.

Conclusion: CodeLutra makes smaller open-source models competitive with closed-source alternatives by learning from successes and mistakes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation but require
significant resources and often over-generalize, limiting their task-specific
efficiency. Fine-tuning smaller, open-source LLMs provides a cost-effective
alternative. However, standard supervised approaches rely only on correct
examples, missing valuable insights from failures. We introduce CodeLutra, a
framework that leverages both correct and incorrect code attempts. Instead of
using only correct solutions, CodeLutra applies iterative preference-based
refinement, comparing successful and failed outputs to better approximate
desired results. This approach narrows the performance gap with
state-of-the-art larger models without requiring massive datasets or auxiliary
models. For instance, on a challenging data science coding task, using only 500
samples improved Llama-3-8B's accuracy from 28.2% to 48.6%, approaching GPT-4's
level. By learning from both successes and mistakes, CodeLutra provides a
scalable and efficient path to high-quality code generation, making smaller
open-source models more competitive with leading closed-source alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenNER 1.0 is a standardized collection of 36 NER datasets across 52 languages, with corrected annotations and uniform entity type names. Baseline results using multilingual and large language models show no single model excels in all languages, highlighting challenges for LLMs in NER.


<details>

Motivation: To provide a standardized, openly-available resource for multilingual and multi-ontology NER research by addressing annotation inconsistencies and enabling model comparison.

Method: Corrected annotation formats, standardized datasets into a uniform representation, and evaluated performance using three multilingual and two large language models.

Result: No single model performs best across all languages, indicating room for improvement, especially for LLMs in NER tasks.

Conclusion: OpenNER 1.0 facilitates NER research by offering a consistent dataset collection, while baseline results underscore the need for further advancements in model performance.

Abstract: We present OpenNER 1.0, a standardized collection of openly-available named
entity recognition (NER) datasets. OpenNER contains 36 NER corpora that span 52
languages, human-annotated in varying named entity ontologies. We correct
annotation format issues, standardize the original datasets into a uniform
representation with consistent entity type names across corpora, and provide
the collection in a structure that enables research in multilingual and
multi-ontology NER. We provide baseline results using three pretrained
multilingual language models and two large language models to compare the
performance of recent models and facilitate future research in NER. We find
that no single model is best in all languages and that significant work remains
to obtain high performance from LLMs on the NER task.

*Yuzuki Arai, Sho Tsugawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Robert Brandom's inferential semantics to understand LLMs like ChatGPT, arguing they exhibit anti-representationalist properties and challenge traditional philosophy of language assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how LLMs generate meaning without relying on external representations, challenging traditional views in philosophy of language.

Method: Analyzes LLMs through Brandom's inferential semantics, focusing on ISA (Inference, Substitution, Anaphora) and RLHF mechanisms.

Result: LLMs show anti-representationalist traits and align with inferential semantics, questioning strict compositionality and semantic externalism.

Conclusion: Inferential semantics offers insights into LLMs' meaning-generation, though further empirical work is needed to validate theoretical claims.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Claude
presents new challenges for philosophy of language, particularly regarding the
nature of linguistic meaning and representation. While LLMs have traditionally
been understood through distributional semantics, this paper explores Robert
Brandom's inferential semantics as an alternative foundational framework for
understanding these systems. We examine how key features of inferential
semantics -- including its anti-representationalist stance, logical
expressivism, and quasi-compositional approach -- align with the architectural
and functional characteristics of Transformer-based LLMs. Through analysis of
the ISA (Inference, Substitution, Anaphora) approach, we demonstrate that LLMs
exhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties in their processing
of language. We further develop a consensus theory of truth appropriate for
LLMs, grounded in their interactive and normative dimensions through mechanisms
like RLHF. While acknowledging significant tensions between inferentialism's
philosophical commitments and LLMs' sub-symbolic processing, this paper argues
that inferential semantics provides valuable insights into how LLMs generate
meaning without reference to external world representations. Our analysis
suggests that LLMs may challenge traditional assumptions in philosophy of
language, including strict compositionality and semantic externalism, though
further empirical investigation is needed to fully substantiate these
theoretical claims.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RSD improves LLM inference efficiency by combining a draft model with a target model, using a reward model to optimize cost-quality trade-offs, achieving 4.4x fewer FLOPs and +3.5 better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods enforce strict unbiasedness, limiting efficiency. RSD aims to prioritize high-reward outputs for better performance.

Method: RSD uses a lightweight draft model and a powerful target model, guided by a process reward model to dynamically decide target model invocation.

Result: RSD achieves up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs and +3.5 better accuracy compared to parallel decoding methods.

Conclusion: RSD is a robust, cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework
aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs).
RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful
target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward
outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce
strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate
intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target
model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality.
We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves
an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive
evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level
tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding
with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving
significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to
+3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for
deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. The code is available at

### [52] [Privacy Ripple Effects from Adding or Removing Personal Information in Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15680)
*Jaydeep Borkar, Matthew Jagielski, Katherine Lee, Niloofar Mireshghallah, David A. Smith, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how PII memorization in LLMs evolves during training, identifying three novel phenomena: assisted memorization, increased memorization from adding PII, and memorization triggered by PII removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamic nature of PII memorization in LLMs and its implications for privacy risks during training.

Method: Analyzes PII memorization throughout training pipelines, focusing on how design choices and dataset changes affect memorization.

Result: Identifies three key phenomena: assisted memorization (up to 1/3 impact), increased memorization from adding PII (up to 7.5×), and memorization due to PII removal.

Conclusion: Model creators must account for these first- and second-order privacy risks to prevent unintended PII regurgitation.

Abstract: Due to the sensitive nature of personally identifiable information (PII), its
owners may have the authority to control its inclusion or request its removal
from large-language model (LLM) training. Beyond this, PII may be added or
removed from training datasets due to evolving dataset curation techniques,
because they were newly scraped for retraining, or because they were included
in a new downstream fine-tuning stage. We find that the amount and ease of PII
memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training
pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three
such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can
elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted
memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3);
(2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our
settings, as much as $\approx\!7.5\times$); and (3) removing PII can lead to
other PII being memorized. Model creators should consider these first- and
second-order privacy risks when training models to avoid the risk of new PII
regurgitation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can accurately automate concept extraction from CT pulmonary embolism (PE) reports, with larger models achieving higher accuracy. A dual-model workflow ensures data quality with minimal human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual abstraction of radiology reports for PE registries is labor-intensive. Automating this process using LLMs could improve efficiency without compromising data quality.

Method: Tested four Llama 3 variants and one reviewer model (Phi 4 14B) on 250 dual annotated CTPE reports from MIMIC IV and Duke University. Measured accuracy, PPV, and NPV against a human gold standard.

Result: Larger models (70B variants) achieved higher accuracy (0.96), with Phi 4 14B reaching 0.98. Dual-model concordance showed high PPV (≥0.95) and NPV (≥0.98) for PE presence and other concepts.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a scalable, accurate solution for PE registry abstraction, with a dual-model workflow ensuring data quality and minimal human oversight.

Abstract: Pulmonary embolism (PE) registries accelerate practice improving research but
rely on labor intensive manual abstraction of radiology reports. We examined
whether openly available large language models (LLMs) can automate concept
extraction from computed tomography PE (CTPE) reports without loss of data
quality. Four Llama 3 variants (3.0 8B, 3.1 8B, 3.1 70B, 3.3 70B) and one
reviewer model, Phi 4 14B, were tested on 250 dual annotated CTPE reports from
each of MIMIC IV and Duke University. Accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV)
and negative predictive value (NPV) versus a human gold standard were measured
across model size, temperature and shot count. Mean accuracy rose with scale:
0.83 (3.0 8B), 0.91 (3.1 8B) and 0.96 for both 70B variants; Phi 4 14B reached
0.98. Accuracy differed by less than 0.03 between datasets, indicating external
robustness. In dual model concordance (L3 70B plus Phi 4 14B) PPV for PE
presence was at least 0.95 and NPV at least 0.98, while location, thrombus
burden, right heart strain and image quality artifacts each achieved PPV of at
least 0.90 and NPV of at least 0.95. Fewer than four percent of individual
concept annotations were discordant, and full agreement occurred in more than
seventy five percent of reports. Large language models therefore provide a
scalable, accurate solution for PE registry abstraction, and a dual model
review workflow can safeguard data quality with minimal human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of fully autonomous LLM-based agents (e.g., hallucinations, safety risks) necessitate human collaboration to improve feasibility and trustworthiness.

Method: The paper provides a structured survey of LLM-HAS, covering core components like human feedback, interaction types, and orchestration, along with emerging applications.

Result: The survey consolidates knowledge on LLM-HAS, offering insights into their design, challenges, and opportunities for human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: LLM-HAS represents a promising interdisciplinary field, with the survey aiming to inspire further research and innovation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents
still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to
hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety
and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in
real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent
systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control
into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety.
These human-agent collaboration systems enable humans and LLM-based agents to
collaborate effectively by leveraging their complementary strengths. This paper
provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies
fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these
systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types,
orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses
unique challenges and opportunities arising from human-AI collaboration. By
consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to
foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving

*Yaorui Shi, Sihang Li, Chang Wu, Zhiyuan Liu, Junfeng Fang, Hengxing Cai, An Zhang, Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRefine is a reinforcement learning framework that improves retrieval-augmented reasoning by refining knowledge between searches, outperforming existing methods in QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by their static knowledge; retrieval-augmented reasoning helps but often retrieves noisy or irrelevant information.

Method: AutoRefine uses reinforcement learning with a "search-and-refine-during-think" paradigm, incorporating knowledge refinement steps and tailored retrieval-specific rewards.

Result: AutoRefine outperforms existing methods, especially in multi-hop QA tasks, by issuing higher-quality searches and synthesizing evidence effectively.

Conclusion: AutoRefine enhances retrieval-augmented reasoning by refining knowledge iteratively, improving accuracy in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but
are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented
reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external
resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information,
hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a
reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new
``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit
knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model
to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an
answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards
alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization.
Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that
AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in
complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine
issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

*Jeffrey T. H. Wong, Cheng Zhang, Xinye Cao, Pedro Gimenes, George A. Constantinides, Wayne Luk, Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A post-training low-rank approximation framework, A³, addresses limitations of existing methods by optimizing Transformer components (QK, OV, MLP) to reduce model size and FLOPs without runtime overhead, outperforming SoTAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-rank approximation methods for large language models ignore Transformer architecture and introduce runtime overhead, limiting their effectiveness compared to pruning or quantization.

Method: A³ splits Transformer layers into QK, OV, and MLP components, providing analytical solutions to reduce hidden dimensions while minimizing functional loss, avoiding runtime overhead.

Result: A³ achieves superior performance, e.g., LLaMA 3.1-70B reaches a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2, outperforming previous SoTA by 3.18.

Conclusion: A³ offers an efficient, versatile solution for model compression, improving end-to-end performance without runtime costs.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however,
their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank
approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches
have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of
individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics
of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small
low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to
other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce
runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small
matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a
post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a
Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$,
and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical
solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while
minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention
scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces
model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime
overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the
optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward
improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that
$\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,
under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank
approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,
outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the
versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and
mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

*Gongfan Fang, Xinyin Ma, Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thinkless is a framework enabling LLMs to adaptively choose between short and long reasoning, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs use extensive reasoning for all queries, leading to inefficiency, especially for simple problems. The goal is to teach LLMs when to think deeply.

Method: Thinkless uses reinforcement learning with two control tokens (<short> and <think>) and a DeGRPO algorithm to decouple reasoning mode selection and answer accuracy.

Result: Thinkless reduces long-chain reasoning by 50%-90% on benchmarks like Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, enhancing efficiency.

Conclusion: Thinkless successfully balances reasoning efficiency and accuracy, offering a scalable solution for adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning,
have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical
inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results
in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems
admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs
learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable
framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and
long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.
Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two
control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed
reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy
Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of
hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the
selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the
accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables
fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing
training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.
Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and
GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -
90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models. The
code is available at https://github.com/VainF/Thinkless

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMILE is a model-agnostic method that explains LLM responses by analyzing input changes and highlighting impactful words via heat maps, improving transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models lack transparency, which is problematic in trust-sensitive fields. SMILE aims to address this by explaining model responses.

Method: SMILE modifies inputs slightly, measures output changes, and creates visual heat maps to highlight influential words.

Result: Tested on leading LLMs, SMILE demonstrated accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity in providing clear explanations.

Conclusion: SMILE enhances AI transparency and trustworthiness by making LLM decision-making processes more understandable.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly
powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to
understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be
problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To
help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models
respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by
slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then
highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps
showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several
leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and
fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these
models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more
transparent and trustworthy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical value framework for Chinese values, creating a large-scale corpus (CVC) to evaluate and align LLMs with Chinese ethical norms, showing strong cultural relevance and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing Western cultural bias and incomplete frameworks in LLM value alignment, ensuring safe AI development by incorporating Chinese values.

Method: Developed a hierarchical framework (3 dimensions, 12 core values, 50 derived values) and a large-scale CVC corpus with human annotation. Evaluated LLMs using CVC-generated scenarios.

Result: CVC-guided scenarios outperformed direct generation, with LLMs preferring CVC options in 70.5% of cases and human annotators aligning 87.5%. Also created 400,000 moral dilemma scenarios.

Conclusion: The work provides a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for value alignment, emphasizing Chinese characteristics and offering open data and code.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values
and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI.
Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias
and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore,
the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations
costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese
values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived
values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values
Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through
human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios
outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In
the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven
mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while
five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming
its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values.
Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that
objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization
across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking
framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing
Chinese characteristics. All data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve optimization in high-dimensional, non-Euclidean parameter spaces of LLMs using geometric principles.

Method: Uses information geometry, particularly the Fisher information metric, to analyze LLM optimization and introduces curvature-aware approaches.

Result: Geometric insights clarify phenomena like sharp minima, generalization, and scaling laws in LLMs.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware methods enhance LLM training understanding, with potential quantum analogies for future optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient
optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate the impact of algorithm updates on Symptom Checkers (SCs) for rare diseases, using synthetic vignettes from HPO. It shows strong predictive accuracy for performance changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing performance degradation in SCs for rare diseases during algorithm updates is challenging due to lack of pre-deployment evaluation methods.

Method: Generates synthetic vignettes from HPO annotations to simulate SC interviews and predict diagnostic performance changes.

Result: Validated with eight past updates, showing strong correlation (R²=0.83 for Recall@8, R²=0.78 for Precision@8) for diseases with phenotype frequency data.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient, low-cost, and transparent pre-deployment evaluation of SC algorithm updates for rare diseases.

Abstract: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide medical information tailored to user symptoms.
A critical challenge in SC development is preventing unexpected performance
degradation for individual diseases, especially rare diseases, when updating
algorithms. This risk stems from the lack of practical pre-deployment
evaluation methods. For rare diseases, obtaining sufficient evaluation data
from user feedback is difficult. To evaluate the impact of algorithm updates on
the diagnostic performance for individual rare diseases before deployment, this
study proposes and validates a novel Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach.
This approach aims to enable this essential evaluation efficiently and at a low
cost. To estimate the impact of algorithm updates, we generated synthetic
vignettes from disease-phenotype annotations in the Human Phenotype Ontology
(HPO), a publicly available knowledge base for rare diseases curated by
experts. Using these vignettes, we simulated SC interviews to predict changes
in diagnostic performance. The effectiveness of this approach was validated
retrospectively by comparing the predicted changes with actual performance
metrics using the R-squared ($R^2$) coefficient. Our experiment, covering eight
past algorithm updates for rare diseases, showed that the proposed method
accurately predicted performance changes for diseases with phenotype frequency
information in HPO (n=5). For these updates, we found a strong correlation for
both Recall@8 change ($R^2$ = 0.83,$p$ = 0.031) and Precision@8 change ($R^2$ =
0.78,$p$ = 0.047). Our proposed method enables the pre-deployment evaluation of
SC algorithm changes for individual rare diseases. This evaluation is based on
a publicly available medical knowledge database created by experts, ensuring
transparency and explainability for stakeholders. Additionally, SC developers
can efficiently improve diagnostic performance at a low cost.

### [62] [SACL: Understanding and Combating Textual Bias in Code Retrieval with Semantic-Augmented Reranking and Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20081)
*Dhruv Gupta, Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy, Yiqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes code retrieval in RACG, revealing biases towards surface-level textual features and well-documented code. It proposes SACL, a framework improving retrieval and generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in code retrieval that affect the quality of code generation.

Method: Systematic masking of features in code retrieval, followed by proposing SACL to enrich textual and structural knowledge.

Result: SACL improves code retrieval (e.g., 12.8% Recall@1 on HumanEval) and code generation (e.g., 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

Conclusion: SACL effectively addresses biases in code retrieval, enhancing both retrieval and generation tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant. Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that
enriches textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural
knowledge with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL
substantially improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on
HumanEval / MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation
performance (e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches neglect personalization in tool-augmented LLMs, limiting their effectiveness in user tasks.

Method: Introduces TAPS, combining a structured tagging tool and uncertainty-based tool detector to integrate user preferences.

Result: TAPS significantly improves LLMs' ability to personalize tool use, setting a new benchmark on the NLSI task.

Conclusion: Personalization is crucial for tool-augmented LLMs, and TAPS provides an effective solution.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them
to interact with external tools, enhancing their ability to perform complex

in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive
analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool
use. To this end, we introduce TAPS, a novel solution that enhances
personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

*Shansan Gong, Ruixiang Zhang, Huangjie Zheng, Jiatao Gu, Navdeep Jaitly, Lingpeng Kong, Yizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores diffusion large language models (dLLMs) for code generation, introducing DiffuCoder, a 7B model trained on 130B tokens. It analyzes dLLM decoding behavior, proposes coupled-GRPO for RL training, and shows improved performance (+4.4% on EvalPlus).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs offer global planning and iterative refinement for code generation, but their training and inference mechanisms are under-explored. This work aims to demystify dLLM decoding and enhance their potential.

Method: The study trains a 7B dLLM (DiffuCoder) on 130B code tokens, analyzes its decoding behavior, and introduces coupled-GRPO, a novel RL sampling scheme to reduce variance and improve efficiency.

Result: DiffuCoder shows unique decoding traits (e.g., non-reliance on semi-AR decoding) and coupled-GRPO boosts performance (+4.4% on EvalPlus) while reducing AR bias.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into dLLM generation and offers an effective RL framework, advancing dLLMs for code generation.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR bias during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

### [65] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren, Yifan Wang, Ruogu Fang, Haibin Ling, Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv is a novel MIL framework using optimal transport to model pathological heterogeneity in WSIs, improving survival prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods fail to capture pathological heterogeneity in WSIs, both globally (long-tailed distributions) and locally (tile-level uncertainty).

Method: OTSurv formulates survival prediction as an OT problem with global long-tail and local uncertainty-aware constraints, solved via an unbalanced OT formulation.

Result: OTSurv achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 3.6% improvement in C-index and statistical significance in log-rank tests.

Conclusion: OTSurv is a powerful, interpretable tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

### [66] [StereoDiff: Stereo-Diffusion Synergy for Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20756)
*Haodong Li, Chen Wang, Jiahui Lei, Kostas Daniilidis, Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoDiff combines stereo matching for static regions and video depth diffusion for dynamic areas to improve video depth estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video depth estimation differs from image depth estimation due to varying temporal consistency needs in static and dynamic regions. Stereo matching excels in static areas, while video depth diffusion handles dynamic regions better.

Method: StereoDiff uses a two-stage approach: stereo matching for static regions and video depth diffusion for dynamic areas, leveraging their complementary strengths.

Result: StereoDiff achieves superior consistency and accuracy in zero-shot, real-world video depth benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: StereoDiff effectively addresses the unique challenges of video depth estimation by combining stereo matching and video depth diffusion, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

*Akio Hayakawa, Masato Ishii, Takashi Shibuya, Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel video-to-audio generation method produces individual audio tracks for specific sound events, mimicking Foley workflows, and outperforms baselines in composite audio quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively capture all sound events in a video, inspired by traditional Foley workflows and concept negation from compositional generation frameworks.

Method: Sequential generation of audio tracks guided by text prompts and prior audio, using pre-trained models without specialized datasets.

Result: Generates multiple distinct audio tracks per video, achieving higher-quality composite audio than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively synthesizes high-quality composite audio by leveraging guided generation and accessible training data.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

*Zhiyuan Wu, Yongqiang Zhao, Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConViTac is a visual-tactile representation learning network using contrastive embeddings for better feature fusion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.0%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual-tactile fusion rely on direct feature combination, leading to poor integration. ConViTac aims to improve alignment and performance.

Method: Uses Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) to project visual and tactile inputs into unified latent embeddings, coupled with cross-modal attention for fusion.

Result: Improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification and grasping prediction tasks.

Conclusion: ConViTac effectively enhances visual-tactile feature fusion and outperforms existing methods in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

*Connor Ludwig, Khashayar Namdar, Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and compares promptable models (SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D) and nnU-Net on medical image segmentation, highlighting SAM's strong performance with accurate prompts but nnU-Net's overall dominance due to practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation of promptable models in medical image segmentation across varying prompt qualities on a common dataset.

Method: Zero-shot inference and fine-tuning of SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net on BraTS 2023 datasets using point and bounding box prompts.

Result: SAM and SAM 2 achieve high Dice scores (up to 0.894) with accurate prompts, but nnU-Net remains superior. Fine-tuning improves point prompt performance but not beyond bounding boxes or nnU-Net.

Conclusion: While promptable models show promise, nnU-Net is still the most practical choice for medical image segmentation due to prompt accuracy challenges.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

*Dejie Yang, Zhu Xu, Xinjie Gao, Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HST-CSLR, a method for continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) that combines gloss knowledge with visual learning using a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST) and contrastive alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large datasets and precise annotations in CSLR limits performance. Existing methods underutilize gloss knowledge.

Method: HST-CSLR constructs a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree for textual representation, aligns visual and textual modalities step-by-step, and uses contrastive alignment.

Result: Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, Sign Language Gesture) show effectiveness.

Conclusion: HST-CSLR improves CSLR by better leveraging gloss knowledge and reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

*Stephanie Käs, Anton Burenko, Louis Markert, Onur Alp Culha, Dennis Mack, Timm Linder, Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA, Gemini Flash 2.0, and HD-GCN. HD-GCN performs best, but V-JEPA shows promise for reducing system complexity. Gemini struggles with zero-shot gesture recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the generalization abilities of VFMs and VLMs for gesture recognition in noisy environments like agile production, aiming to reduce system complexity compared to traditional task-specific architectures.

Method: The study compares V-JEPA (a VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a VLM), and HD-GCN (a skeleton-based approach) using the NUGGET dataset for human-robot communication in intralogistics.

Result: HD-GCN achieves the best performance, while V-JEPA comes close with a simple classification head, suggesting potential for multi-task use. Gemini struggles in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: VFMs like V-JEPA offer a promising path to reduce system complexity, but further research is needed for VLMs like Gemini to improve gesture recognition based on textual descriptions.

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

*Cansu Korkmaz, Ahmet Murat Tekalp, Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using vision-language models (VLMs) to select the most trustworthy super-resolution (SR) image from diffusion-generated sets, validated by a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between fidelity and perceptual quality in SR models and the challenge of selecting reliable solutions from diverse diffusion outputs.

Method: Leverages VLMs (e.g., BLIP-2, GPT-4o) to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifacts, then ensembles top-ranked candidates. Introduces TWS, a hybrid metric combining semantic similarity, structural integrity, and artifact sensitivity.

Result: TWS correlates strongly with human preference, and VLM-guided selections achieve high TWS values, outperforming conventional metrics like PSNR and LPIPS.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, generalizable solution for trustworthy SR, aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simulate how human actions shape the environment from a first-person perspective, addressing challenges in modeling real-world environments and embodied behaviors.

Method: An auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer is trained on the Nymeria dataset, leveraging kinematic pose trajectories structured by body joint hierarchy.

Result: The model demonstrates capabilities in embodied prediction and control, evaluated through a hierarchical protocol.

Conclusion: This work is a pioneering effort in predicting egocentric video from human actions, offering insights into modeling complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

*Ha Min Son, Shahbaz Rezaei, Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixCLR is introduced to address the challenge of semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) by explicitly regularizing domain-invariant representations, leveraging pseudo-labels and a repelling term for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSDG methods lack explicit regularization for domain-invariant representations, limiting their effectiveness in generalizing to out-of-distribution data with limited labels.

Method: FixCLR adapts contrastive learning by using class information from pseudo-labels and a repelling term, and can be combined with existing SSDG methods.

Result: Extensive experiments show FixCLR's effectiveness, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods, and highlight its performance in various scenarios.

Conclusion: FixCLR is a promising SSDG method that enhances domain generalization by explicitly addressing domain invariance, with complementary improvements when integrated with other techniques.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

TL;DR: COVER introduces vector contrastive learning (CL) to address over-dispersion in pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining (SSP), preserving feature correlations and improving medical vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CL's binary optimization causes over-dispersion, disrupting pixel-wise feature correlations, which is critical for medical vision.

Method: COVER reformulates CL as vector regression, quantifies dispersion via feature distances, and uses a vector pyramid for granularity adaptation.

Result: COVER significantly enhances pixel-wise SSP across 8 tasks, 2 dimensions, and 4 modalities.

Conclusion: COVER advances generalizable medical visual foundation models by preserving pixel-wise feature correlations.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

Motivation: Accurate recognition of ambiguous facial expressions in real-world scenarios is crucial for practical DFER applications.

Method: MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining video frames and their soft emotion labels, extending mixup to video data.

Result: Models trained with MIDAS outperform state-of-the-art methods on DFEW and FERV39k-Plus datasets.

Conclusion: MIDAS is a simple yet effective solution for enhancing DFER performance, especially for ambiguous expressions.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [77] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThirdEye introduces a cue-aware pipeline for monocular depth estimation, leveraging pre-trained networks to explicitly provide monocular cues like occlusion boundaries and shading, fused hierarchically with a working-memory module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular depth estimation methods implicitly learn from RGB pixels, missing explicit cues humans use. ThirdEye aims to incorporate these cues deliberately.

Method: ThirdEye uses pre-trained, frozen networks to supply cues, fuses them in a three-stage cortical hierarchy with a working-memory module, and produces disparity maps via an adaptive-bins transformer.

Result: The method inherits external supervision from frozen cue experts, requiring only modest fine-tuning. Detailed results will be provided in a future revision.

Conclusion: ThirdEye improves depth estimation by explicitly incorporating human-relevant cues, reducing reliance on implicit learning.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction (OccOoD) to detect anomalies in 3D voxel space, addressing limitations of existing methods. It proposes a synthetic anomaly integration pipeline and two datasets, achieving state-of-the-art OoD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction struggle with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, posing safety risks in autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose OccOoD, a framework integrating OoD detection with 3D semantic occupancy prediction, using Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) and an RWKV-based branch for geometry-semantic fusion. They also introduce a synthetic anomaly integration pipeline to create datasets (VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360).

Result: OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection (AuROC: 67.34%, AuPRCr: 29.21%) within a 1.2m region while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance.

Conclusion: The work advances 3D semantic occupancy prediction by addressing OoD challenges, with publicly available datasets and code.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m
region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The
established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiHuman-Testbench, a benchmark for evaluating generative models in multi-human image generation, addressing challenges like identity preservation and action complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a dedicated benchmark for multi-human image generation, especially for preserving facial identities and complex actions, motivates the creation of MultiHuman-Testbench.

Method: The benchmark includes 1800 samples with text prompts, 5,550 unique face images, and pose conditioning. It uses four metrics for evaluation and proposes techniques like human segmentation and Hungarian matching.

Result: The benchmark evaluates diverse models, showing improvements in ID similarity and providing standardized insights for multi-human generation research.

Conclusion: MultiHuman-Testbench offers a valuable tool and insights for advancing research in multi-human image generation, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

*Yihong Cao, Jiaming Zhang, Xu Zheng, Hao Shi, Kunyu Peng, Hang Liu, Kailun Yang, Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UNLOCK, a source-free method for panoramic image segmentation, addressing distortions and occlusions without needing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image processing faces challenges like distortions and limited annotations. Existing methods require source data, which is impractical.

Method: UNLOCK uses Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning to adapt without source data or target labels.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance (10.9 mAAP, 11.6 mAP) and +4.3 mAPQ improvement over source-only methods.

Conclusion: UNLOCK is a practical, source-free solution for panoramic segmentation, matching source-dependent methods' performance.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper explores the geometric principles of stereo vision, emphasizing 3D structure and human-like perception for accurate depth reconstruction. It introduces new geometric constraints and evaluates deep learning-based stereo matching and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve depth reconstruction in stereo vision by integrating geometric priors and learned features, inspired by human perception.

Method: Revisits the Cyclopean Eye model, proposes novel geometric constraints, and evaluates stereo feature matching and attention mechanisms using deep learning.

Result: Combining geometric priors with learned features enhances understanding and performance of stereo vision systems.

Conclusion: Integrating geometry and learning provides better abstractions for stereo vision, improving depth reconstruction.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model
and propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth
discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

### [82] [Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21349)
*Yizhe Cheng, Chunxun Tian, Haoru Wang, Wentao Zhu, Xiaoxuan Ma, Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physics-driven framework for solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP), improving generalization and robustness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning approaches like Img-Interiors lack generalization and fail under sparse transmitter setups, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The authors reformulate EISP as a two-stage process, introducing a current estimator and permittivity solver to decouple nonlinear scattering from the ill-posed inverse problem.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and robustness, especially in sparse transmitter scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a new perspective on EISP, advancing practical electromagnetic imaging solutions.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

*Advait Gupta, Rishie Raj, Dang Nguyen, Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaSTA$^*$, a neurosymbolic agent combining LLMs for fast planning and A$^*$ search for accurate tool-use, optimizing cost and efficiency in multi-turn image editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of cost-efficient multi-turn image editing by combining fast high-level planning with accurate local search, reducing computational costs.

Method: Combines LLMs for subtask planning and A$^*$ search for tool-use, with inductive reasoning to reuse successful subroutines, creating an adaptive fast-slow planning system.

Result: FaSTA$^*$ is more computationally efficient than recent methods while maintaining competitive success rates.

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$ effectively balances speed and accuracy, offering a cost-efficient solution for complex image editing tasks.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2SFormer, a Transformer-based framework, improves forgery localization by unifying multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions and using a global prior map for better detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for forgery localization struggle with computational overhead and limited representation power, especially for subtle or complex tampering.

Method: M2SFormer integrates multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in skip connections and employs a global prior map with a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve fine details.

Result: M2SFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models in forgery detection and localization, showing superior generalization across unseen domains.

Conclusion: The proposed M2SFormer framework effectively addresses challenges in forgery localization, offering improved accuracy and detail preservation.

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysRig is a physics-based skinning and rigging framework that addresses limitations of Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) by simulating deformable soft-body structures driven by a rigid skeleton, yielding more realistic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBS introduces artifacts like volume loss and unnatural deformations, failing to model elastic materials. PhysRig aims to overcome these issues with a physics-based approach.

Method: PhysRig embeds a rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., tetrahedral mesh), simulated as a deformable soft-body. It uses continuum mechanics and discretizes objects as particles on an Eulerian grid for differentiability. Material prototypes reduce the learning space.

Result: PhysRig outperforms LBS, producing more realistic and physically plausible deformations. It is validated on a diverse synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: PhysRig offers a versatile solution for articulated object modeling, demonstrated in tasks like pose transfer, and improves realism over traditional methods.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Conclusion: The new dataset and benchmarks fill a gap in aviation weather ML research, offering a practical resource for visibility estimation.

Abstract: Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for
providing low-cost alternatives for traditional, expensive weather sensors;
however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available
datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation,
of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are
absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of
a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera
network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying
three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and
tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when
compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OmniEval, a benchmark for evaluating

distinctive features: (i) Full-modal collaboration: We design evaluation tasks

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial VAE framework, detects covariate shifts in OOD data using batch statistics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing covariate shifts in OOD detection to improve understanding of in-distribution boundaries and enhance detection performance.

Method: Uses adversarial discriminators with Batch Normalization, leveraging batch statistics. DisCoPatch trains the discriminator with suboptimal VAE outputs as negative samples.

Result: Achieves 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) and 95.0% on Near-OOD benchmarks, with a compact 25MB model size and low latency.

Conclusion: DisCoPatch is an efficient, practical solution for OOD detection, outperforming prior methods while maintaining compactness and speed.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many
applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied,
this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data
distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that
detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution
boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators
trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form
distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD
detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference,
batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data
distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses
the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples
to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the
boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening
this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD
detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate
shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior
methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of
25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than
existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world
OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computational pathology models lack integration of natural language and text-based context, and current MLLMs have limitations in training data, multi-image understanding, and autonomous reasoning.

Method: PathChat+ is trained on over 1 million pathology-specific instruction samples and 5.5 million QA turns. It is integrated with SlideSeek for hierarchical reasoning on whole-slide images.

Result: PathChat+ outperforms prior models and achieves high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging differential diagnosis benchmark. It also generates interpretable reports.

Conclusion: PathChat+ and SlideSeek address key limitations in computational pathology, offering advanced diagnostic reasoning and interpretable outputs.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,
humanly-interpretable summary reports.

*Xuesong Li, Dianye Huang, Yameng Zhang, Nassir Navab, Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scene graph (SG) method for ultrasound images to improve interpretability and scanning guidance for non-experts, validated on neck region images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of medical ultrasound variability and the unmet need for interpretability and guidance for non-expert users, especially in point-of-care settings.

Method: Uses a transformer-based one-stage method to compute ultrasound SGs, refined by LLMs for user queries, and explores SGs for scanning guidance.

Result: Validated on neck region images, showing potential to democratize ultrasound by enhancing interpretability and usability.

Conclusion: The SG-based approach effectively improves ultrasound interpretability and scanning guidance for non-experts.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

*Lingling Cai, Kang Zhao, Hangjie Yuan, Xiang Wang, Yingya Zhang, Kejie Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFVEdit is an efficient zero-shot video editing method for Video DiTs, eliminating attention modification and fine-tuning, achieving 20x speed-up and 85% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods for Video DiTs incur high computational overhead due to attention modification or fine-tuning.

Method: DFVEdit operates on clean latents via flow transformation, using Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV), Implicit Cross Attention (ICA), and Embedding Reinforcement (ER).

Result: Achieves 20x inference speed-up, 85% memory reduction, and state-of-the-art performance in editing quality.

Conclusion: DFVEdit is a practical and efficient solution for video editing in Video DiTs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

### [92] [From Cradle to Cane: A Two-Pass Framework for High-Fidelity Lifespan Face Aging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20977)
*Tao Liu, Dafeng Zhang, Gengchen Li, Shizhuo Liu, Yongqi Song, Senmao Li, Shiqi Yang, Boqian Li, Kai Wang, Yaxing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cradle2Cane is a two-pass face aging framework using T2I diffusion models to balance age accuracy and identity preservation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face aging methods struggle with the Age-ID trade-off, either sacrificing identity for age accuracy or vice versa.

Method: Proposes a two-pass framework: first pass uses AdaNI for age accuracy, and the second pass uses IDEmb for identity preservation, both trained end-to-end.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on CelebA-HQ, achieving better age accuracy and identity consistency.

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane effectively balances age transformation and identity preservation, setting a new benchmark in face aging.

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

### [93] [3D Scene-Camera Representation with Joint Camera Photometric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20979)
*Weichen Dai, Kangcheng Ma, Jiaxin Wang, Kecen Pan, Yuhang Ming, Hua Zhang, Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D scene-camera representation with joint photometric optimization improves 3D scene quality by separating scene-unrelated distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric distortions in camera imaging degrade 3D scene representations, necessitating a method to account for and correct these distortions.

Method: Proposes a full photometric model and camera representation, optimizing parameters to separate scene-unrelated information and using depth regularization.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D scene representations despite imaging degradations like vignetting and dirt.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates camera photometric models into scene mapping, enhancing representation accuracy.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

### [94] [Rethink Sparse Signals for Pose-guided Text-to-image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20983)
*Wenjie Xuan, Jing Zhang, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SP-Ctrl, a method using sparse signals (like OpenPose) for pose-guided text-to-image generation, addressing challenges of dense signals. It enhances sparse signals with learnable spatial representations and keypoint concept learning, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose) pose editing difficulties and inconsistencies with text prompts, motivating a revisit to sparse signals for their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature.

Method: SP-Ctrl extends OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation and introduces keypoint concept learning to improve pose alignment.

Result: SP-Ctrl outperforms recent methods in sparse-pose guidance tasks and matches dense signal-based performance, with promising cross-species generation capabilities.

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl demonstrates the effectiveness of sparse signals for pose-guided image generation, offering simplicity and robustness.

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

*Xiao Zhang, Yongqiang Ma, Haodong Jing, Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVA, a Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework, improves CZSL by addressing limitations in primitive feature extraction and compositional divergence, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods use suboptimal composition-prototype mapping and neglect compositional divergence, limiting fine-grained alignment.

Method: Proposes EVA with domain-expert adaption for token-aware learning and semantic variant alignment for accurate image-primitives matching.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three benchmarks in closed- and open-world settings.

Conclusion: EVA effectively addresses CZSL challenges, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

TL;DR: PathSegmentor is a text-prompted segmentation foundation model for pathology images, addressing data and category limitations. It uses PathSeg, a large dataset, and outperforms existing models in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology image segmentation methods struggle with limited annotated data and narrow category definitions, hindering clinical applications.

Method: Proposes PathSegmentor, a text-prompted model, and introduces PathSeg, a comprehensive dataset with 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 categories.

Result: PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models, surpassing them by 0.145 and 0.429 in Dice scores, and enhances interpretability for clinical decisions.

Conclusion: PathSegmentor advances explainable AI in precision oncology, offering robust, accurate, and interpretable pathology image segmentation.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

TL;DR: TSDASeg improves 3D point cloud segmentation by aligning 3D features with text/2D data using a two-stage model with cross-modal alignment and memory modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D VLMs underperform in point-level tasks due to lack of direct 3D-text alignment, limiting local feature-text linking.

Method: Proposes TSDASeg with a direct cross-modal alignment module and memory banks for text, visual features, and mappings, updated via attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: TSDASeg effectively addresses inconsistencies in interactive segmentation by leveraging cross-modal alignment and dynamic memory updates.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: Proposes DBMovi-GS for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular videos, addressing limitations of existing methods by restoring sharpness and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in dynamic, blurry scenes due to reliance on high-resolution images or static assumptions.

Method: Uses sparse-controlled Gaussian splatting to generate dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness and reconstructing dynamic 3D geometry.

Result: Achieves robust performance in novel view synthesis for dynamic blurry scenes, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS effectively addresses the challenge of synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIC method enhances abnormal cell detection by composing style-aligned, high-fidelity pathological images without additional training, improving model robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges like poor annotations, long-tailed data, and inconsistent staining styles in cytopathology to improve neural network training for abnormal cell detection.

Method: SAIC selects candidates from an abnormal cell bank, uses high-frequency feature reconstruction for style-aligned composition, and filters images with a vision-language model.

Result: SAIC-synthesized images boost detection performance, especially for tail categories and styles, with confirmed generalizability in clinical settings.

Conclusion: SAIC is practical and effective for enhancing abnormal cell detection, with potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

TL;DR: The paper explores Inverse Scene Text Removal (ISTR), focusing on detecting STR-processed images and localizing removed text regions, with potential applications in misuse detection and STR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse risks of STR technology have increased, prompting the need to detect and analyze STR-processed images to prevent potential misuse and enhance STR methods.

Method: The study investigates ISTR, performing binary classification (detecting STR use) and localizing removed text regions. It also attempts text recovery using a text recognizer.

Result: Experiments show high accuracy in detecting STR-processed images and localizing removed text, demonstrating the feasibility of misuse detection and STR enhancement.

Conclusion: ISTR effectively addresses STR misuse risks, offering tools for detection, localization, and potential text recovery, thereby improving STR technology.

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

*Fuyan Ma, Yiran He, Bin Sun, Shutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPA-FER improves FER by aligning multimodal prompts with fine-grained textual-visual relationships, leveraging LLM-generated descriptions and prototype-guided alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based FER methods fail to capture subtle textual-visual relationships crucial for distinguishing facial expressions.

Method: MPA-FER uses LLM-generated hard prompts, aligns soft prompts with these, and employs prototype-guided and cross-modal alignment for precise feature learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmarks while maintaining pretrained model benefits and low computational costs.

Conclusion: MPA-FER effectively enhances FER by integrating fine-grained semantic guidance and multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionGuard improves helmet violation detection in traffic surveillance by addressing environmental and data challenges with multi-stage modules, boosting mAP by 3.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing road safety through reliable helmet regulation enforcement despite environmental and data inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes VisionGuard with Adaptive Labeling (tracking-based refinement) and Contextual Expander (virtual bounding boxes for underrepresented classes).

Result: Improves mAP by 3.1% over baseline detectors, showing real-world deployment potential.

Conclusion: VisionGuard effectively addresses detection challenges, promoting safety and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (FFCL-SAM) improves breast cancer tumor margin assessment by combining Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), achieving higher accuracy and speed than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D specimen radiography (SR) for intraoperative margin assessment has limited accuracy, leading to high re-excision rates.

Method: Uses FFCL for pre-training ResNet-18 to classify margin status, then prompts SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation.

Result: AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification, 27.4% Dice improvement, and 47ms inference time per image.

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM enhances margin assessment accuracy and speed, potentially reducing re-excision rates in breast cancer surgery.

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The Aging Multiverse framework generates diverse facial aging trajectories from a single image, conditioned on external factors like environment, health, and lifestyle, using a training-free diffusion-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods model aging as a single deterministic path, lacking diversity and control over external factors. This work aims to visualize diverse aging futures while balancing identity preservation, age accuracy, and condition control.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion-based method with attention mixing for editing strength modulation and Simulated Aging Regularization to stabilize edits.

Result: Outperforms existing models in identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment, as shown by experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: The approach transforms aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable process, enabling applications in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a less invasive method for novel view synthesis using locally reconstructed light fields and error visualization, reducing user effort and improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR methods for view synthesis are mentally demanding and restrict capture areas due to rigid sampling theory. The goal is to free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration.

Method: Proposes using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to guide new view insertion, reducing the need for extensive sampling.

Result: Error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment, and requires fewer view samples. The method also supports larger scenes in radiance field reconstruction.

Conclusion: The approach improves user experience and efficiency in novel view synthesis, with potential applications in larger-scale scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

*Hansam Cho, Seoung Bum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGS improves faithfulness in text-guided diffusion models for image editing without compromising editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between editability and faithfulness in image editing using diffusion models.

Method: Proposes Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS) to enhance faithfulness and resolve misalignment with editability.

Result: FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability and works with diverse editing methods.

Conclusion: FGS enables precise, high-quality image edits by balancing faithfulness and editability effectively.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

### [107] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie, Kun Yuan, Yunpeng Qu, Jiachao Gong, Mingda Wu, Ming Sun, Chao Zhou, Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline to automate video quality assessment (VQA) instruction data, addressing limitations of numerical scores and human-dependent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical scores in VQA lack descriptive power, and existing methods rely on human annotations, limiting scalability. The goal is to leverage video large multimodal models (LMMs) for richer quality descriptions.

Method: Proposes SIG, which scores unlabeled videos, maps scores to text levels, and uses hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model quality correlations. Creates the Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset and a progressive tuning strategy for LMMs.

Result: SIG generates 320K instruction-response pairs (S2I dataset) and improves video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities, validated on S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SIG pipeline automates VQA instruction data, enhancing LMMs' capabilities without human dependency, and sets a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

*Sanjoy Chowdhury, Subrata Biswas, Sayan Nag, Tushar Nagarajan, Calvin Murdock, Ishwarya Ananthabhotla, Yijun Qian, Vamsi Krishna Ithapu, Dinesh Manocha, Ruohan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoAdapt is a framework for efficient egocentric perception tasks, reducing computational costs while maintaining or outperforming state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of modern perception models hinder real-world deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: EgoAdapt uses cross-modal distillation and policy learning, adaptable to task-specific action spaces.

Result: Achieves significant efficiency gains: up to 89.09% reduction in GMACs, 82.02% in parameters, and 9.6x in energy, while matching or surpassing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EgoAdapt effectively balances efficiency and performance, making it suitable for real-world egocentric perception tasks.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different
egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active
speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.
Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens,
EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the
performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

*Huan Wang, Haoran Li, Huaming Chen, Jun Yan, Jiahua Shi, Jun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedSC introduces semantic-aware collaboration in federated learning to address data heterogeneity by leveraging relational and consistent prototypes for improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning leads to biased labeling preferences, and existing methods often overlook intra-client semantic information.

Method: FedSC constructs relational and consistent prototypes for semantic-level collaboration, using inter-contrastive learning and discrepancy aggregation.

Result: FedSC demonstrates effectiveness in challenging scenarios, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: FedSC successfully leverages semantic knowledge to handle data heterogeneity, improving federated learning performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel classical-quantum GAN generates color medical images, outperforming classical and hybrid models with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in skin disease datasets (class imbalance, privacy, bias) and inefficiencies of classical generative models.

Method: Developed a classical-quantum latent space fusion technique for a hybrid GAN.

Result: Generates high-quality color images, boosts classification performance, and requires fewer parameters/epochs than classical models.

Conclusion: Quantum image generation shows promise for medical applications as quantum hardware improves.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

*Lei Hao, Lina Xu, Chang Liu, Yanni Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network (LASFNet) is proposed for efficient multimodal object detection, reducing computational costs while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for multimodal object detection involve complex training processes with high computational overhead, necessitating a simpler and more efficient solution.

Method: LASFNet uses a single feature-level fusion unit and introduces an attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion (ASFF) module for adaptive feature adjustment. A lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is also included to minimize information loss.

Result: The method reduces parameters and computational costs by 90% and 85% respectively, while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3% on three datasets.

Conclusion: LASFNet offers a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, making it a practical solution for multimodal object detection.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be
open-sourced at https://github.com/leileilei2000/LASFNet.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 1D binary image latents for compact image representation, achieving competitive performance in text-to-image models with fewer tokens and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational demands and improve efficiency in high-resolution image modeling by advancing compact discrete image representation.

Method: Introduces 1D binary image latents, representing images as binary vectors instead of one-hot codebook tokens, enabling fewer tokens and preserving details.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in diffusion and auto-regressive generation with 128 tokens for 1024x1024 images, reducing tokens by 32x and improving training/inference speed.

Conclusion: The 1D binary latent space offers a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional tokenization, with competitive performance and no need for private data or refinements.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios due to lack of annotated datasets. MultiClip-Bench dataset and IPFormer-VideoLLM model are introduced to address this, improving multi-shot understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs fail in multi-shot scenarios (e.g., varying camera angles or scene changes), leading to issues like identity forgetting and key frame negligence.

Method: Introduce MultiClip-Bench dataset with dense descriptions and QA pairs for multi-shot scenarios. Propose IPFormer-VideoLLM, which injects instance-level features via an attention-based connector.

Result: Training with MultiClip-Bench boosts multi-shot performance. IPFormer-VideoLLM enhances multi-scene understanding and performs well on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The new dataset and model significantly improve multi-shot video understanding and set a reliable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DidSee is a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects, addressing biases and feature limitations in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial RGB-D cameras produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects, and traditional methods struggle with generalization due to limited training data.

Method: DidSee integrates a rescaled noise scheduler, a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation, and a semantic enhancer for joint depth completion and segmentation.

Result: DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, robust real-world generalization, and improves downstream tasks like pose estimation and robotic grasping.

Conclusion: DidSee effectively addresses biases and feature limitations, enhancing depth completion for non-Lambertian objects and demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal reasoning models, proposing a method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with context, format, accuracy, and logical rewards to enhance global context understanding and prevent shortcut problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multimodal reasoning by addressing insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems in existing models.

Method: Uses RL with rewards (context, format, accuracy, logical) judged by a large language model (LLM) to ensure thorough reasoning and integration of multimodal information. Introduces IntentBench for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates advanced performance on multiple omni-modal benchmarks compared to other open-source models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances multimodal reasoning by leveraging RL and LLM-judged rewards, validated by superior benchmark performance.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve domain generalization and adaptation in detectors using diffusion models, reducing inference time by 75% and enhancing performance on source and target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detectors often underperform due to domain gaps between training and testing data. Existing methods using diffusion models struggle with high inference costs and underutilize their capabilities.

Method: Extracts intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, introduces an object-centered auxiliary branch with box-masked images and class prompts, and applies consistency loss for alignment. Also aligns standard detectors with diffusion detectors for cross-domain performance.

Result: Achieves competitive results on 3 DA and 5 DG benchmarks, with significant advantages in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the superiority of diffusion models in domain-generalized and adaptive detection tasks, offering insights for diverse visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance adversarial transferability by leveraging self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) features, which outperform traditional supervised learning methods.

Method: Proposes dSVA, a generative framework combining contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modeling (MIM) features, utilizing a generator and attention mechanisms.

Result: dSVA achieves superior black-box transferability across various model architectures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Exploiting self-supervised ViT features (CL and MIM) significantly improves adversarial transferability, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed dSVA framework.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document analysis solutions lack flexibility for user-customized applications, prompting the need for a more adaptable approach.

Method: The paper proposes RoI-Matcher, a framework using a siamese network and cross-attention layers to match regions in documents. A benchmark (RoI-Matching-Bench) with three difficulty levels is introduced for evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RoI-Matcher on the benchmark, establishing it as a baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the need for flexible document region matching, providing a practical solution and benchmark for further advancements.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

Conclusion: The method provides a reliable foundation for automated scar quantification, supporting broader clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential

TL;DR: SAMURAI combines CLIP-based semantic matching and shape-guided re-ranking for 3D object retrieval from masked 2D images and natural language, achieving strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in retrieving 3D objects from limited 2D masked images and ambiguous language prompts in complex indoor environments.

Method: Integrates CLIP-based semantic matching, shape-guided re-ranking using binary silhouettes, and a majority voting strategy. Includes preprocessing for mask quality.

Result: Competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set.

Conclusion: Combining shape priors with language understanding is key for robust 3D object retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

### [122] [HalluSegBench: Counterfactual Visual Reasoning for Segmentation Hallucination Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21546)
*Xinzhuo Li, Adheesh Juvekar, Xingyou Liu, Muntasir Wahed, Kiet A. Nguyen, Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalluSegBench is introduced to evaluate hallucinations in vision-language segmentation, focusing on counterfactual visual reasoning. It includes a dataset of 1340 counterfactual pairs and new metrics, revealing vision-driven hallucinations are more common than label-driven ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination lack visual context manipulation, limiting their ability to diagnose critical failures in grounded visual understanding.

Method: HalluSegBench is developed with a dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs across 281 object classes and new metrics to quantify hallucination sensitivity under visual edits.

Result: Experiments show vision-driven hallucinations are more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning is essential for diagnosing grounding fidelity in vision-language segmentation models.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

### [123] [PoseMaster: Generating 3D Characters in Arbitrary Poses from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21076)
*Hongyu Yan, Kunming Luo, Weiyu Li, Yixun Liang, Shengming Li, Jingwei Huang, Chunchao Guo, Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseMaster is an end-to-end framework for 3D character generation, unifying pose transformation and 3D reconstruction to address distortion and degradation issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-based methods for 3D character modeling suffer from distortion due to self-occlusion and viewpoints, affecting reconstruction quality.

Method: PoseMaster integrates pose transformation and 3D generation into a flow-based framework, using 3D body bones as pose conditions and employing random condition masking during training.

Result: PoseMaster outperforms state-of-the-art methods in A-pose character generation and achieves precise arbitrary-pose control.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves 3D character modeling by addressing key challenges in pose standardization and reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

*Minghao Qin, Yan Shu, Peitian Zhang, Kun Lun, Huaying Yuan, Juenjie Zhou, Shitao Xiao, Bo Zhao, Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-X^2L introduces bi-level KV compression and selective KV re-loading to efficiently handle long-video understanding tasks, outperforming existing methods while saving computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational cost and information loss challenges in long-video understanding for multimodal large language models.

Method: Uses bi-level KV compression (L-KVs and H-KVs) and selective KV re-loading to balance detail preservation and computational efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing KV-compression methods on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench while saving computation.

Conclusion: Video-X^2L is a simple, effective, and training-free solution for enhancing long-video understanding in MLLMs.

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

*Mahmoud Tahmasebi, Saif Huq, Kevin Meehan, Marion McAfee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to improve real-time stereo matching by mitigating information loss in small-scale cost volumes, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time stereo matching with high accuracy is challenging due to the trade-off between large-scale cost volumes (accurate but slow) and small-scale ones (fast but less accurate).

Method: ESM integrates primary features into disparity upsampling, extracts and fuses features, and refines them using a compact feature-guided hourglass network.

Result: ESM achieves 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on AGX Orin, with high disparity map accuracy.

Conclusion: ESM effectively balances accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time autonomous systems.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

### [126] [BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21209)
*Louis Kerner, Michel Meintz, Bihe Zhao, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BitMark is a robust bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity, designed to prevent model collapse by embedding detectable signals in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of model collapse due to reused generated content as training data necessitates a reliable method to identify and mitigate such issues.

Method: BitMark embeds watermarks at the bit level of token streams across multiple resolutions during image generation, ensuring robustness and visual fidelity.

Result: BitMark preserves generation speed and visual quality while being resistant to removal techniques and exhibiting high radioactivity in downstream models.

Conclusion: BitMark offers a principled solution to detect and prevent model collapse in generative models by reliably marking generated outputs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleFusion is a two-stage framework for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS), using MLLM with SAR for glyph analysis and OSVF for generating semantically enriched vector fonts, improving readability and aiding experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The undeciphered OBS characters, with their complexity, challenge interpretation. This paper aims to enhance decipherment through advanced semantic typography.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) MLLM with SAR for glyph analysis and visual localization, 2) OSVF for generating accurate, semantically enriched vector fonts.

Result: OracleFusion outperforms baselines in semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, aiding experts in deciphering OBS.

Conclusion: OracleFusion advances OBS decipherment by providing expert-like insights and visually enhanced representations.

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

TL;DR: FlickCD is a lightweight model for remote sensing change detection, balancing high accuracy with low resource use. It introduces an Enhanced Difference Module and Local-Global Fusion Blocks to optimize performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of complex deep learning models in change detection by proposing a resource-efficient solution suitable for on-satellite processing.

Method: Uses an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to highlight critical feature differences and suppress irrelevant variations. Incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks with Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA) for multi-scale semantic capture.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance or minor accuracy trade-offs (<1% F1) while reducing computational and storage costs significantly.

Conclusion: FlickCD offers a practical, efficient solution for change detection, ideal for resource-constrained environments like satellite processing.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient updates of 3D scene representations are essential for robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI, avoiding the computational cost of full re-optimization.

Method: CL-Splats uses a change-detection module to segment updated and static scene components, enabling local optimization and storage of previous scene states.

Result: CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with higher reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CL-Splats provides a robust foundation for real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework is introduced for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent uncertainty and multimodality of trajectory prediction in autonomous driving challenge existing data-driven methods, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: The GoIRL framework uses vectorized context representations, a feature adaptor for lane-graph aggregation, and a hierarchical trajectory generator with refinement and probability fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse & nuScenes benchmarks and shows superior generalization.

Conclusion: GoIRL effectively addresses multimodality and uncertainty, offering a promising alternative to supervised learning for trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack extremely low-light conditions (0.0001 lux), limiting research. The paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: Proposes a paired data synthesis pipeline for generating low-light RAW images and a diffusion-based framework with an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and color consistency loss.

Result: The method effectively restores images from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, validated on the SIED dataset and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SIED dataset and proposed framework advance low-light RAW image enhancement, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks

TL;DR: A novel hierarchical state space model for efficient surgical workflow analysis in long robot-assisted surgeries, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long surgical videos challenge existing transformer models due to their quadratic attention, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical state space model with local and global modules, trained using hybrid discrete-continuous supervision.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by +2.8% to +12.9% across datasets.

Conclusion: The model efficiently processes full-length videos, capturing both local and global dynamics, with superior performance.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

TL;DR: YOLO-FDA is a YOLO-based framework for surface defect detection, integrating fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion to improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like redundant features, limited detail sensitivity, and weak robustness in existing AI-based defect detection methods.

Method: Uses a BiFPN-style architecture for feature aggregation, a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM) for spatial detail enhancement, and attention-based fusion strategies (AC and CAF) for better contextual representation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across diverse defect types and scales.

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA effectively enhances defect detection performance by combining fine-grained detail enhancement and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

TL;DR: The paper introduces tree-based semantic loss functions for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation, improving performance on sparsely annotated datasets and enabling OOD detection without compromising ID segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning methods for biomedical segmentation penalize errors uniformly, ignoring inter-class semantics. The paper aims to leverage hierarchical label structures for better performance.

Method: Two tree-based semantic loss functions are introduced and integrated into a sparse, background-free annotation training approach.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a 107-class HSI dataset and effectively detects OOD pixels.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances segmentation accuracy and OOD detection, demonstrating the value of hierarchical label semantics in HSI tasks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two modules, CAA and GOS, to improve image-to-point cloud registration by addressing feature channel attention differences and redundant correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds degrade matching results, and similar scene structures cause redundant correspondences.

Method: Introduces Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) to enhance intra-modal features and suppress cross-modal sensitivity, and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS) for global optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CAA and GOS modules effectively improve registration accuracy by addressing key challenges in cross-modal matching.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art

### [136] [Geometry and Perception Guided Gaussians for Multiview-consistent 3D Generation from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21152)
*Pufan Li, Bi'an Du, Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method integrates geometry and perception priors for high-fidelity 3D object reconstruction from single images, outperforming existing approaches in consistency and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D object generation from single-view images lack multiview consistency and geometric detail, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: The approach trains three Gaussian branches (geometry prior, perception prior, Gaussian noise) and refines them through mutual interaction and reprojection-based depth consistency.

Result: The method achieves higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions, excelling in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method robustly generates consistent and detailed 3D objects from single images, addressing key limitations of prior work.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

*Longkun Zou, Kangjun Liu, Ke Chen, Kailing Guo, Kui Jia, Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework to address the Sim2Real domain gap in 3D point cloud classification by leveraging global topology and self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Sim2Real domain gap in 3D point cloud data limits classifier generalization, and current UDA methods lack robust descriptors for global topology.

Method: The TAM framework uses global spatial topology and self-supervised learning to model topological relations, combined with cross-domain contrastive learning and self-training.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show TAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Sim2Real UDA tasks.

Conclusion: TAM effectively mitigates the Sim2Real gap and improves generalization, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

### [138] [GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21188)
*Zijun Lin, Shuting He, Cheston Tan, Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GroundFlow, a plug-in module for temporal reasoning in 3D point cloud sequential grounding (SG3D), improving accuracy over baseline methods and outperforming a pre-trained 3D large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods fail to extract temporal information from multi-step text instructions, leading to challenges in handling pronouns and context in SG3D tasks.

Method: Proposes GroundFlow, a module for temporal reasoning that selectively extracts short-term and long-term step information to enhance context understanding.

Result: GroundFlow improves baseline accuracy by +7.5% and +10.2% in the SG3D benchmark, outperforming a pre-trained 3D large language model.

Conclusion: GroundFlow enhances temporal reasoning in 3DVG models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SG3D across five datasets.

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

### [139] [TITAN: Query-Token based Domain Adaptive Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21484)
*Tajamul Ashraf, Janibul Bashir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TITAN, a method for source-free domain adaptive object detection, addressing pseudo-label noise by partitioning target images into easy/hard subsets and using adversarial modules to reduce domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve adaptation in SF-DAOD where source data is unavailable, avoiding performance degradation due to noisy pseudo-labels from domain shifts.

Method: TITAN partitions target images into easy/hard subsets based on detection variance and integrates query-token adversarial modules into a student-teacher framework.

Result: Experiments show TITAN outperforms SOTA methods, with mAP improvements of up to +22.7% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: TITAN effectively addresses pseudo-label noise and domain gaps, achieving superior performance in SF-DAOD.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedPrompt is a unified framework combining a few-shot prompted LLM (Llama-4-17B) for task planning and a modular CNN (DeepFusionLab) for image processing, enabling scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image analysis systems are task-specific and lack flexibility for user-defined workflows. MedPrompt addresses these limitations.

Method: Uses an LLM for interpreting user instructions and routing task-specific pretrained weights, avoiding full retraining. Evaluated on 19 datasets across 12 tasks.

Result: Achieves 97% correctness in prompt execution, 2.5s latency, and competitive accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 for segmentation, F1 0.9744 for classification).

Conclusion: MedPrompt combines LLM interpretability with CNN efficiency, enabling scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging.

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-quality-focused framework for training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), emphasizing the importance of high-quality reference sets to improve performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVS methods rely on pre-trained models or synthetic data, but their performance is limited by model capabilities or poor-quality reference sets. This work addresses the overlooked data quality issue.

Method: The proposed framework includes a data pipeline to create a high-quality reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval method.

Result: Evaluations on ten benchmarks show the method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, demonstrating the impact of data-centric design.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical role of data quality in advancing training-free OVS and provides a simple yet effective solution.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

anatomical plausibility while jointly predicting joint means and full
covariances. (3) Filtering: root-normalized trajectories are variance-weighted
according to HPSTM's uncertainty estimates, suppressing residual noise. (4)

*Umaima Rahman, Mohammad Yaqub, Dwarikanath Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiMPLe disentangles invariant and spurious features in multi-modal learning, improving OOD performance via mutual information minimization, spurious feature regularization, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations in visual data hinder OOD performance; DiMPLe aims to disentangle features across modalities for better generalization.

Method: Combines mutual information minimization, spurious feature regularization, and contrastive learning on invariant features.

Result: Outperforms CoOp-OOD, with gains of 15.27 in base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Conclusion: DiMPLe effectively improves generalization and robustness in multi-modal learning.

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

*Xianghan Meng, Zhengyu Tong, Zhiyuan Huang, Chun-Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (TR²C) for Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), improving performance by learning structured representations and affinity, outperforming existing subspace clustering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subspace clustering methods assume high-dimensional temporal data aligns with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution, but this may not hold for complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds.

Method: The proposed TR²C jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment frame sequences, ensuring temporally consistent representations aligned with UoS.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets show TR²C achieves state-of-the-art performance with various feature extractors.

Conclusion: TR²C effectively addresses the limitations of subspace clustering for HMS, offering superior segmentation by learning structured representations.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DuIOD and DuET, a framework for dual incremental object detection, addressing both class and domain shifts without exemplars, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CIOD and DIOD) fail to handle both class and domain shifts simultaneously, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework with Directional Consistency Loss, detector-agnostic and exemplar-free.

Result: DuET achieves +13.12% RAI on Pascal Series and +11.39% RAI on Diverse Weather Series, with high Avg RI retention.

Conclusion: DuET effectively handles dual incremental learning, improving retention and adaptability, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

*Cheng Zou, Senlin Cheng, Bolei Xu, Dandan Zheng, Xiaobo Li, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTI proposes a video virtual try-on method using conditional video inpainting with a Diffusion Transformer, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with inconsistency when applying image-based try-on techniques frame by frame. ViTI addresses this by treating video try-on as a video inpainting task.

Method: ViTI uses a Diffusion Transformer with 3D spatial-temporal attention, masking strategies, and multi-stage training to inpaint garments in videos.

Result: ViTI outperforms previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, achieving better consistency and detail preservation.

Conclusion: ViTI effectively solves video virtual try-on by leveraging video inpainting, offering superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Text-Image Alignment (TIA) framework and WordCon, a hybrid PEFT method, to improve word-level typography control in generated images, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise word-level typography control in generated images is challenging, requiring better alignment between text and image regions.

Method: The TIA framework uses cross-modal correspondence from grounding models, and WordCon reparameterizes key parameters for efficiency. Masked and joint-attention losses enhance controllability.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative results show the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and method effectively address word-level typography control, with datasets and code made available for academic use.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using synthetic data to learn disentangled representations for real images, investigating transferability and proposing a new metric for evaluating factor encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangled Representation Learning struggles with real images due to correlated factors and lack of ground truth labels. The study aims to leverage synthetic data to bridge this gap.

Method: The study involves empirical analysis of synthetic-to-real transfer, fine-tuning effects, and introduces an interpretable intervention-based metric for evaluating disentanglement.

Result: Findings show that transferring disentangled representations from synthetic to real data is feasible and effective, with some preserved properties.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can aid disentangled representation learning for real images, and the proposed metric helps assess factor encoding quality.

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

*Diego Biagini, Nassir Navab, Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraSurg is a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework using two diffusion models to ensure consistency with surgical actions and phases, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical video generation lacks consistency with surgical actions and phases, needing fine-grained guidance for factual simulation.

Method: HieraSurg uses two diffusion models: one predicts coarse-grained semantic changes, and the other generates the final video by integrating these with fine-grained visual features.

Result: Outperforms prior work quantitatively and qualitatively, showing strong generalization and higher frame-rate video generation.

Conclusion: HieraSurg's fine-grained adherence to segmentation maps highlights its potential for practical surgical applications.

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

### [150] [Continual Self-Supervised Learning with Masked Autoencoders in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21312)
*Lars Möllenbrok, Behnood Rasti, Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CoSMAE, a continual self-supervised learning method using masked autoencoders, combining data and model mixup to reduce catastrophic forgetting in remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods in remote sensing require many labeled samples, which are costly. CoSMAE aims to address this by leveraging self-supervised learning.

Method: CoSMAE uses data mixup (interpolating images) and model mixup knowledge distillation (interpolating model weights) to regularize learning and reduce forgetting.

Result: CoSMAE improves performance by up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CoSMAE effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances generalization in continual learning for remote sensing.

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for human-centric tasks by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features, creating a specialized dataset and benchmark. Fine-tuning the LLaVA-1.5-7B model with this data improves performance by 33.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs underperform in complex human-centric tasks due to a lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data.

Method: Generates a dataset (200,328 samples) combining human keypoints, captions, and bounding boxes, and fine-tunes the LLaVA-1.5-7B model. Introduces the E-HPAUB benchmark for evaluation.

Result: The fine-tuned LLaVA-Pose model achieves a 33.2% improvement over the original model on the E-HPAUB benchmark.

Conclusion: Keypoint-integrated data significantly enhances VLMs for human-centric visual understanding.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for
human-centric visual understanding. Code is available at

*Lojze Zust, Yohann Cabon, Juliette Marrie, Leonid Antsfeld, Boris Chidlovskii, Jerome Revaud, Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanSt3R proposes a unified approach for 3D panoptic segmentation, eliminating test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view segmentation in a single forward pass, achieving faster and scalable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on 2D panoptic segmentation and require costly test-time optimization, failing to leverage spatial relationships across views. PanSt3R aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: PanSt3R builds on MUSt3R, enhancing it with semantic awareness and multi-view panoptic segmentation. It introduces a principled mask merging procedure and a novel-view prediction method.

Result: PanSt3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and is significantly faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: PanSt3R offers a simple, fast, and scalable solution for 3D panoptic segmentation, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

TL;DR: ShotBench is a benchmark for cinematic language understanding, revealing VLMs' limitations. ShotQA and ShotVL are introduced to improve performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack proficiency in understanding nuanced cinematic grammar, limiting AI-assisted video generation.

Method: Introduces ShotBench (3.5k QA pairs) and ShotQA (70k QA pairs), then develops ShotVL via fine-tuning and optimization.

Result: Top VLMs score <60% accuracy on ShotBench; ShotVL outperforms all models, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: ShotBench and ShotQA advance cinematic understanding, with ShotVL demonstrating significant improvements. Resources are open-sourced.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in long-video understanding like capturing long-range dependencies and processing redundant information efficiently.

Method: Proposes HERMES with Episodic COmpressor (ECO) for temporal aggregation and Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) for semantic enrichment.

Result: Improves SOTA models' performance, reduces inference latency by 43%, and memory usage by 46%. Achieves SOTA in benchmarks.

Conclusion: HERMES is effective for long-video understanding, offering modular integration and standalone performance.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents unique challenges that extend beyond
traditional short-video analysis approaches, particularly in capturing
long-range dependencies, processing redundant information efficiently, and
extracting high-level semantic concepts. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This
paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with
Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance
existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic
COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to
semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal
dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations
with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing
feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We
demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA
models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference
latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding
benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene graph datasets lack precision and exhaustive annotations, limiting scene understanding capabilities.

Method: Developed CoPa-SG, a synthetic dataset with precise ground truth and new relation types (parametric and proto-relations).

Result: Improved scene graph generation model performance and enhanced downstream applications like planning and reasoning.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG and its novel relation types advance scene graph understanding and practical applications.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToosiCubix is a monocular image-based method for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles, requiring minimal user input and no specialized equipment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on expensive setups, limiting accessibility for large-scale data collection.

Method: Uses 10 user clicks per vehicle, formulates geometric constraints as an optimization problem solved via coordinate descent, and incorporates probabilistic size priors.

Result: Accurately estimates vehicle position, orientation, and dimensions (8 DoF), validated against KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets.

Conclusion: Offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid annotation.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GroundCap, an ID-based grounding system for image captioning that tracks object identities and links actions to objects, using a dataset of 52,016 images with annotated captions. It proposes gMETEOR for evaluation and shows improved verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current captioning systems lack precise grounding of text to visual elements, making outputs hard to verify. Existing methods fail to track object identities or link actions and objects consistently.

Method: The approach uses persistent object IDs for reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and background segmentation via K-means clustering. It fine-tunes Pixtral-12B and Qwen2.5-VL 7B on the GroundCap dataset.

Result: Human evaluation confirms the system's effectiveness in producing verifiable descriptions with coherent object references.

Conclusion: The proposed ID-based grounding system improves caption verifiability and coherence, demonstrated by the GroundCap dataset and gMETEOR metric.

Abstract: Current image captioning systems lack the ability to link descriptive text to
specific visual elements, making their outputs difficult to verify. While
recent approaches offer some grounding capabilities, they cannot track object
identities across multiple references or ground both actions and objects
simultaneously. We propose a novel ID-based grounding system that enables
consistent object reference tracking and action-object linking. We present
GroundCap, a dataset containing 52,016 images from 77 movies, with 344
human-annotated and 52,016 automatically generated captions. Each caption is
grounded on detected objects (132 classes) and actions (51 classes) using a tag
system that maintains object identity while linking actions to the
corresponding objects. Our approach features persistent object IDs for
reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and the segmentation of
background elements through K-means clustering. We propose gMETEOR, a metric
combining caption quality with grounding accuracy, and establish baseline
performance by fine-tuning Pixtral-12B and Qwen2.5-VL 7B on GroundCap. Human
evaluation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in producing verifiable
descriptions with coherent object references.

*Long Tian, Yufei Li, Yuyang Dai, Wenchao Chen, Xiyang Liu, Bo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastRef is a prototype refinement framework for few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) that enhances prototype representativeness by iteratively transferring query features and suppressing anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-IAD methods neglect query image statistics, limiting prototype representativeness. FastRef addresses this gap.

Method: FastRef uses a two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer via linear reconstruction and (2) anomaly suppression via optimal transport (OT) for prototype alignment.

Result: FastRef improves performance when integrated with PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO across four datasets (MVTec, ViSA, MPDD, RealIAD) under 1/2/4-shot settings.

Conclusion: FastRef is effective and computationally efficient for FS-IAD, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

*Zhirui Gao. Renjiao Yi, Yaqiao Dai, Xuening Zhu, Wei Chen, Chenyang Zhu, Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a one-stage framework, CurveGaussian, for 3D parametric curve reconstruction from multi-view edge maps, outperforming two-stage methods by eliminating error accumulation and enabling differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage methods suffer from error accumulation due to disconnected optimization stages. The paper aims to directly optimize 3D parametric curves from 2D edge maps for cleaner and more robust reconstructions.

Method: The proposed method uses a bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components (CurveGaussian) for differentiable rendering. It also employs dynamic topology optimization (linearization, merging, splitting, pruning) during training.

Result: The method outperforms two-stage alternatives on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks, producing cleaner reconstructions with fewer parameters and higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The one-stage approach with CurveGaussian and dynamic topology optimization achieves superior performance and efficiency in 3D parametric curve reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in vision models are computationally expensive. Restricted attention mechanisms reduce costs but compromise coherence. StyleNAT aims to balance efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes multi-receptive-field attention in transformers, integrating Neighborhood Attention into a StyleGAN architecture.

Result: Achieves FID of 2.05 on FFHQ (6% better than StyleGAN-XL), uses 28% fewer parameters, and has 4× throughput.

Conclusion: StyleNAT sets a new Pareto Frontier for efficient, high-quality image generation, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: While the integration of transformers in vision models have yielded
significant improvements on vision tasks they still require significant amounts
of computation for both training and inference. Restricted attention mechanisms
significantly reduce these computational burdens but come at the cost of losing
either global or local coherence. We propose a simple, yet powerful method to
reduce these trade-offs: allow the attention heads of a single transformer to
attend to multiple receptive fields.
  We demonstrate our method utilizing Neighborhood Attention (NA) and integrate
it into a StyleGAN based architecture for image generation. With this work,
dubbed StyleNAT, we are able to achieve a FID of 2.05 on FFHQ, a 6% improvement
over StyleGAN-XL, while utilizing 28% fewer parameters and with 4$\times$ the
throughput capacity. StyleNAT achieves the Pareto Frontier on FFHQ-256 and
demonstrates powerful and efficient image generation on other datasets. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-subject control in text-to-image generation often compromise editability and coherence, leading to artifacts or attribute entanglement.

Method: XVerse transforms reference images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, ensuring precise control over individual subjects.

Result: The model achieves high-fidelity, editable multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over subject characteristics and semantic attributes.

Conclusion: XVerse significantly enhances personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces optical flow loss and depth regularization to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for endoscopic SLAM, addressing photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in endoscopic scenarios, like photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion, hinder SLAM performance.

Method: Uses optical flow loss for geometric constraints, depth regularization for photometric issues, and refines 3DGS with keyframes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation on static and dynamic datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements significantly improve 3DGS-based SLAM for endoscopic applications.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

*Samuel Joutard, Marijn Stollenga, Marc Balle Sanchez, Mohammad Farid Azampour, Raphael Prevost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSORT is a framework using a hyper-network to predict UNet parameters from latent vectors, addressing biases in medical imaging datasets by learning a distribution of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets often contain biases that degrade segmentation performance, but identifying these biases is challenging.

Method: HyperSORT jointly learns hyper-network parameters and latent vectors for each training sample, creating a distribution of UNet parameters to capture noise and robust segmentation patterns.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real datasets, HyperSORT identifies biases and clusters latent space to yield UNet parameters aligned with learned biases.

Conclusion: HyperSORT effectively structures datasets to uncover biases and improve segmentation, with code and analysis publicly available.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

*Daniel DeAlcala, Aythami Morales, Julian Fierrez, Gonzalo Mancera, Ruben Tolosana, Javier Ortega-Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MINT, a method to detect if specific data was used to train AI models, achieving up to 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess privacy and fairness in AI by verifying if sensitive data was used in training.

Method: Proposes two MINT architectures (MLPs and CNNs) to detect training data via activation patterns, tested on face recognition systems.

Result: Achieves up to 90% accuracy in identifying training data usage.

Conclusion: MINT can enforce privacy and fairness in AI, especially for sensitive data in LLMs.

Abstract: This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel
approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the
training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures
designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited
Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures
are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face
Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems.
Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising
over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are
considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT
approach achieves promising results, with up to 90\% accuracy, indicating the
potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The
proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI
applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for
training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).

TL;DR: The study benchmarks deep learning approaches for classifying atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in breast cancer, achieving high accuracy with LoRA-based fine-tuning of foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitoses are prognostically relevant but hard to identify due to low prevalence, subtle differences, and dataset imbalances.

Method: Compared deep learning models (baseline, foundation models with linear probing, and LoRA fine-tuning) using the AMi-Br dataset and introduced new datasets (AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD).

Result: Achieved balanced accuracies of 0.8135 (AMi-Br), 0.7696 (AtNorM-Br), and 0.7705 (AtNorM-MD), with LoRA-based models performing best.

Conclusion: Atypical mitosis classification can be effectively addressed using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques, with all code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

*Jian Chen, Peilin Zhou, Yining Hua, Dading Chong, Meng Cao, Yaowei Li, Wei Chen, Bing Zhu, Junwei Liang, Zixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPOT algorithm improves VLM performance for meteorological heatmap analysis by addressing irregular shapes and colors. ClimateIQA dataset and Climate-Zoo models enhance accuracy in weather feature interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with precise color identification and spatial localization in complex meteorological heatmaps, leading to inaccurate interpretations.

Method: Introduces SPOT for processing irregular shapes, constructs ClimateIQA dataset, and develops Climate-Zoo fine-tuned VLMs.

Result: SPOT and Climate-Zoo outperform existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.

Conclusion: SPOT and ClimateIQA significantly improve VLM capabilities for extreme weather analysis.

Abstract: Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather
phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours,
unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical
hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current
state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks
such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in
inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we
introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm
specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual
data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial
coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building
on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120
instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and
heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial
cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in
interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop
Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA,
which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap
tasks.

*Mohamed Omran, Dimitris Kalatzis, Jens Petersen, Amirhossein Habibian, Auke Wiggers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for precise object placement in images using a visual map and coarse masks, improving flexibility and accuracy without altering the background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-conditioned generative models struggle with precise object placement, requiring complex inpainting masks or prompts. This work aims to simplify and enhance this process.

Method: The approach uses a carefully designed visual map and coarse object masks to guide object placement, leveraging an inpainting model to preserve the background.

Result: The method effectively handles object placement with accurate pose and location, even for non-trivial shape changes, and combines location and appearance control.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers high-quality, flexible object placement with precise control, outperforming joint modeling approaches.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

*Cyrus Addy, Ajay Kumar Gurumadaiah, Yixiang Gao, Kwame Awuah-Offei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A thermal imaging dataset for miner detection in underground mining emergencies is introduced, tested with state-of-the-art algorithms, and shown feasible for future safety applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underground mining safety challenges necessitate reliable miner detection for emergency response, but current datasets for deep learning are insufficient.

Method: A novel thermal imaging dataset was created by capturing mining activities. Algorithms like YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR were evaluated for baseline performance.

Result: The dataset provides a robust foundation for miner detection algorithms, demonstrating feasibility for emergency applications.

Conclusion: This work is a critical step toward reliable thermal-based miner detection systems, paving the way for future research in mining safety.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

*Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LF-CFG, a method to mitigate oversaturation and artifacts in diffusion models by addressing redundant low-frequency signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High guidance scales in classifier-free guidance (CFG) cause oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts, prompting the need for a solution.

Method: LF-CFG uses adaptive threshold-based measurement to identify and down-weight redundant low-frequency information.

Result: LF-CFG effectively reduces oversaturation and artifacts in models like Stable Diffusion-XL and SiT-XL.

Conclusion: LF-CFG provides a practical solution to improve diffusion model performance by targeting low-frequency signal issues.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from drone imagery, addressing urban traffic monitoring challenges with novel methods and high-quality datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of ground-based systems and improve urban traffic monitoring using high-altitude drone imagery.

Method: Integrates tailored object detection, track stabilization, georeferencing, vehicle dimension estimation, and road segmentation.

Result: Produced two datasets (Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision) with high accuracy, validated against probe vehicle data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of drones and computer vision for precise, cost-effective traffic monitoring, aiding intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle
trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in
urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based
systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a
tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view
perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle
bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto
and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent
alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework
features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation,
enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International
Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment
covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over
four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic
dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the
Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about
300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision
sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and
consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public
release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for
the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality,
reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the
potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for
precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable
resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing
traffic management strategies.

### [174] [Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21469)
*Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi, Hung-Fu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes dynamic, static, and hybrid methods for traffic signal design using turning movement count (TMC) data, validated through simulations in Las Vegas intersections. Results show optimal cycle times and highlight the hybrid method's adaptability to bimodal traffic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate TMC data is essential for traffic signal design and congestion analysis, but existing methods may not adapt well to varying traffic conditions.

Method: Developed a vision-based tracking system to estimate TMC, synthesized intersection data for SUMO simulations, and tested static, dynamic, and hybrid signal configurations.

Result: Optimal cycle times of 90-120 seconds were identified; dynamic timing worked better for four intersections, while hybrid methods improved performance for bimodal traffic patterns.

Conclusion: The hybrid method, switching between dynamic and static configurations, is most effective for managing traffic flow, especially in intersections with uneven zone-based traffic distributions.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCME, a framework for modeling transitivity-enforced entailment in vision-language models, improving hierarchical data representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to explicitly model the transitive nature of entailment, limiting their ability to represent hierarchical data structures.

Method: Proposes Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME) to optimize partial order of concepts, enabling explicit transitivity modeling.

Result: RCME outperforms state-of-the-art models in hierarchical species classification and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RCME effectively represents hierarchical structures in vision-language models, with open-sourced code and models.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RRDA is a novel SF-OSDA framework that explicitly learns features for unknown classes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing SF-OSDA methods, which fail to explicitly learn discriminative features for target-private unknown classes.

Method: A two-stage process: (1) training a target classifier with an additional decision boundary using synthetic samples, and (2) adapting the model to the target domain.

Result: RRDA significantly outperforms existing SF-OSDA and OSDA methods on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RRDA effectively addresses domain shifts and improves distinguishability of unknown classes, making it a robust SF-OSDA solution.

Abstract: Open-set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled target domain, where novel classes - also referred to as
target-private unknown classes - are present. Source-free Open-set Domain
Adaptation (SF-OSDA) methods address OSDA without accessing labeled source
data, making them particularly relevant under privacy constraints. However,
SF-OSDA presents significant challenges due to distribution shifts and the
introduction of novel classes. Existing SF-OSDA methods typically rely on
thresholding the prediction entropy of a sample to identify it as either a
known or unknown class, but fail to explicitly learn discriminative features
for the target-private unknown classes. We propose Recall and Refine (RRDA), a
novel SF-OSDA framework designed to address these limitations by explicitly
learning features for target-private unknown classes. RRDA employs a two-stage
process. First, we enhance the model's capacity to recognize unknown classes by
training a target classifier with an additional decision boundary,guided by
synthetic samples generated from target domain features. This enables the
classifier to effectively separate known and unknown classes. Second, we adapt
the entire model to the target domain, addressing both domain shifts and
distinguishability to unknown classes. Any off-the-shelf source-free domain
adaptation method (e.g. SHOT, AaD) can be seamlessly integrated into our
framework at this stage. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that RRDA significantly outperforms existing SF-OSDA and OSDA
methods.

*Tobias J. Riedlinger, Kira Maag, Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses miscalibrated confidence estimates in object detection models by proposing a spatial statistics-based framework for better uncertainty quantification, especially in empty regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detectors lack proper uncertainty quantification outside detected bounding boxes, posing safety risks in applications like automated driving.

Method: The authors propose a statistical framework using marked point processes to model bounding box data, enabling likelihood-based training and well-defined confidence estimates for drivable regions.

Result: The method demonstrates improved calibration and performance in uncertainty estimation for object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed spatial statistics-based approach effectively addresses uncertainty quantification gaps in object detection, enhancing safety in critical applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

*Jiahe Chen, Jiaying He, Qian Shao, Qiyuan Chen, Jiahe Ying, Hongxia Xu, Jintai Chen, Jianwei Zheng, Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a training-free decoding framework to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by dynamically aligning text generation with visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding strategies for LVLMs suffer from static constraints, inefficiency, and loss of detail, leading to hallucinations—text contradicting visual input.

Method: DLC uses CLIP to assess semantic alignment between images and generated text, evaluates candidate tokens' Relative Visual Advantage (RVA), and employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance visual guidance and text quality.

Result: DLC significantly reduces hallucinations across benchmarks and LVLM architectures (e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP) while maintaining inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DLC is an effective, efficient decoding-time solution to enhance LVLM reliability by mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in cross-modal image-text retrieval by proposing a set-based method with Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity and two loss functions to improve embedding diversity and distinction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-vector embeddings fail to capture nuanced cross-modal relationships, while set-based methods face issues like sparse supervision and set collapse.

Method: Proposes Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity for one-to-one matching between embedding sets, along with Global Discriminative Loss and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to enhance diversity and distinction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k without external data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses set-based representation challenges, improving cross-modal retrieval performance.

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

TL;DR: GGTalker improves speech-driven 3D talking heads by combining generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation, achieving high-quality results with better lip-sync and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with large head rotations, OOD audio, and require time-consuming identity-specific training due to insufficient 3D priors.

Method: GGTalker uses a two-stage Prior-Adaptation strategy: learning Gaussian head priors (Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual) and adapting to individual characteristics. It includes a color MLP for textures and a Body Inpainter for blending.

Result: GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: GGTalker addresses limitations of previous methods by leveraging generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation, producing photorealistic talking heads.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

*Xiwei Deng, Xianchun He, Jianfeng Bao, Yudan Zhou, Shuhui Cai, Congbo Cai, Zhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MvKeTR, a multi-view knowledge-enhanced transformer for CT report generation, improving diagnostic accuracy by mimicking clinicians' workflow and incorporating domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CT report generation lack effective multi-view diagnostic information and clinical expertise, limiting accuracy and reliability.

Method: MvKeTR uses a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) for multi-view synthesis and a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) to incorporate clinical records. It employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for better parameter efficiency and spectral bias reduction.

Result: The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art models on the CTRG-Chest-548K dataset across most metrics.

Conclusion: MvKeTR enhances CT report generation by effectively integrating multi-view data and clinical knowledge, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: CT report generation (CTRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports
for 3D volumes, relieving clinicians' workload and improving patient care.
Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate
diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical
expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these
limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced
TansfoRmer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as
radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View
Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention is proposed to
synthesize diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views effectively.
Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records
to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) is
devised to retrieve the most similar reports based on the query volume to
incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure. Furthermore, instead
of traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as the
fundamental building blocks of both modules, which exhibit superior parameter
efficiency and reduced spectral bias to better capture high-frequency
components critical for CT interpretation while mitigating overfitting.
Extensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548 K dataset demonstrate that
our method outpaces prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across almost all
metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/xiweideng/MvKeTR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gradient-Guided Distillation (G²D) addresses modality imbalance in multimodal learning by using a custom loss function and dynamic modality prioritization, improving weak modality utilization and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: G²D combines unimodal and multimodal objectives in a knowledge distillation framework and uses dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) to balance modality influence.

Result: G²D enhances weak modality significance during training and outperforms existing methods in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: G²D effectively mitigates modality imbalance, improving multimodal model performance by ensuring balanced modality utilization.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: PRG leverages pretrained generative models for discriminative tasks by reversing their generative process, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of generative models in discriminative tasks and overcome limitations of previous generative classifiers.

Method: Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG) reverses the generative process of pretrained models to extract unsupervised representations for downstream tasks.

Result: PRG outperforms prior methods, achieving 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet (64x64) and demonstrating robustness in out-of-distribution evaluations.

Conclusion: PRG effectively repurposes generative models for discriminative tasks, offering flexible feature extraction and superior performance.

Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have
significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative
tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative
classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for
discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained
Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by
reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model.
PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high
capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream
tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies
tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms
prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including
out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/opendilab/PRG.

TL;DR: MADrive enhances scene reconstruction by replacing observed vehicles with similar 3D assets from a memory bank, enabling photorealistic synthesis of altered driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstructions are limited to original observations and struggle with novel or altered scenarios.

Method: Uses MAD-Cars dataset and a retrieval module to replace vehicles with 3D assets, aligning and relighting them for integration.

Result: Enables photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered configurations.

Conclusion: MADrive extends reconstruction capabilities for more flexible and realistic AD environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous scene generation methods are limited in scale or lack consistency. InfiniCube aims to address these issues by enabling large-scale, controllable dynamic scene generation.

Method: The method uses a map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model, a repurposed video model with pixel-aligned guidance buffers, and a fast feed-forward approach to create dynamic 3D Gaussians.

Result: InfiniCube generates realistic and controllable 3D driving scenes, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively achieves scalable, high-fidelity, and controllable 3D scene generation, outperforming previous approaches.

Abstract: We present InfiniCube, a scalable method for generating unbounded dynamic 3D
driving scenes with high fidelity and controllability. Previous methods for
scene generation either suffer from limited scales or lack geometric and
appearance consistency along generated sequences. In contrast, we leverage the
recent advancements in scalable 3D representation and video models to achieve
large dynamic scene generation that allows flexible controls through HD maps,
vehicle bounding boxes, and text descriptions. First, we construct a
map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model to unleash its power for
unbounded voxel world generation. Then, we re-purpose a video model and ground
it on the voxel world through a set of carefully designed pixel-aligned
guidance buffers, synthesizing a consistent appearance. Finally, we propose a
fast feed-forward approach that employs both voxel and pixel branches to lift
the dynamic videos to dynamic 3D Gaussians with controllable objects. Our
method can generate controllable and realistic 3D driving scenes, and extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the necessity of cost volumes in optical flow methods and propose a simpler, more efficient alternative.

Method: Uses high-resolution warping instead of cost volumes, reducing memory usage and improving speed.

Result: Ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks, best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, and is 4.1x faster than comparable methods.

Conclusion: WAFT demonstrates that cost volumes are not essential for high performance in optical flow, offering a simpler and more efficient solution.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SID-Set, a large and diverse deepfake detection dataset for social media, and SIDA, a framework for detecting, localizing, and explaining deepfakes using multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic AI-generated images poses misinformation risks, but existing datasets and solutions are inadequate for social media contexts.

Method: The authors create SID-Set (300K annotated images) and propose SIDA, a framework using multimodal models for detection, localization, and explanation.

Result: SIDA outperforms state-of-the-art models on SID-Set and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The release of SID-Set and SIDA advances deepfake detection for social media, addressing gaps in dataset diversity and detection capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic
images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance,
a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences
and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite
some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake
detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to
address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image
Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive
volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with
comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic
and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with
images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere
visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of
large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection,
localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image
Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the
authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask
prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria.
Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other
benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior
performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be
released.

TL;DR: StruMamba3D improves point cloud representation learning by addressing adjacency destruction and long-sequence memory loss in SSM, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods struggle with preserving spatial dependencies and long-sequence memory in point cloud tasks.

Method: Proposes StruMamba3D with spatial states, state-wise updates, lightweight convolution, and adaptive sequence length strategy.

Result: Achieves 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% on ScanObjectNN, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: StruMamba3D effectively enhances SSM for point cloud learning, setting new benchmarks in accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without
voting strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an occlusion-aware multi-view generation framework for 3D reconstruction from single occluded images, improving consistency and quality without prior inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction from occluded single images, which existing diffusion-based models fail to handle.

Method: End-to-end framework synthesizing six consistent novel views from occluded images, trained self-supervised with Pix2Gestalt dataset and pseudo-ground-truth views.

Result: Enables occlusion-aware 3D reconstruction without manual annotations or inpainting, introducing a benchmark for standardized evaluation.

Conclusion: The method advances occlusion-aware 3D reconstruction, offering a practical solution and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Result: Demonstrates robust cross-modal segmentation and efficient pseudo-label generation, validated on Waymo-4DSeg.

Conclusion: SAM4D shows strong potential for cross-modal segmentation and scalable data annotation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in envmap estimation and handles challenging out-of-domain images effectively.

Conclusion: Materialist enables physically consistent image editing without requiring full scene geometry, with strong performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Achieving physically consistent image editing remains a significant challenge
in computer vision. Existing image editing methods typically rely on neural

Progressive differentiable rendering is then used to optimize the environment
map and refine the material properties with the goal of closely matching the
rendered result to the input image. Our approach enables a range of
applications, including material editing, object insertion, and relighting,
while also introducing an effective method for editing material transparency
without requiring full scene geometry. Furthermore, Our envmap estimation

Conclusion: SiM3D fills a gap in 3D ADS benchmarks, offering a comprehensive dataset and baselines for future research in synthetic-to-real anomaly detection.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of

segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or

Result: Achieves 33% improvement on Calvin ABC-D benchmark and better success rates in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: UP-VLA effectively bridges the gap in spatial understanding for VLAs, enhancing performance in embodied tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization
capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding
tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior
research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and
neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial
information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial
for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training
paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and
introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both
multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives,
enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial
understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement
on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.
Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world
manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.

TL;DR: Zero-TIG is a zero-shot learning method for enhancing low-light and underwater videos without paired ground truth, using Retinex theory and optical flow for temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on paired ground truth, limiting practicality and failing to ensure temporal consistency in video enhancement.

Method: Zero-TIG combines an enhancement module (denoising, illumination estimation, reflection denoising) and a temporal feedback module (histogram equalization, optical flow, image warping) to maintain consistency.

Result: The method effectively enhances low-light and underwater videos without paired training data, addressing noise, contrast, and color distortion.

Conclusion: Zero-TIG is a practical and promising solution for real-world video enhancement, eliminating the need for paired data and ensuring temporal consistency.

Abstract: Low-light and underwater videos suffer from poor visibility, low contrast,
and high noise, necessitating enhancements in visual quality. However, existing
approaches typically rely on paired ground truth, which limits their
practicality and often fails to maintain temporal consistency. To overcome
these obstacles, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot learning approach
named Zero-TIG, leveraging the Retinex theory and optical flow techniques. The
proposed network consists of an enhancement module and a temporal feedback
module. The enhancement module comprises three subnetworks: low-light image
denoising, illumination estimation, and reflection denoising. The temporal
enhancement module ensures temporal consistency by incorporating histogram
equalization, optical flow computation, and image warping to align the enhanced
previous frame with the current frame, thereby maintaining continuity.
Additionally, we address color distortion in underwater data by adaptively
balancing RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves low-light video enhancement without the need for paired training data,
making it a promising and applicable method for real-world scenario
enhancement.

*Kai Huang, Hao Zou, Bochen Wang, Ye Xi, Zhen Xie, Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AirCache is a KV cache compression method for LVLMs that reduces computational overhead by strategically compressing visual tokens, maintaining performance while significantly speeding up inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs face high computational demands due to processing many visual tokens and generating long outputs, leading to excessive KV cache usage.

Method: AirCache analyzes token correlations, identifies redundant visual tokens, and uses an elite observation window and adaptive layer-wise budget allocation to compress the KV cache.

Result: The method retains only 10% of visual KV cache, reducing decoding latency by 29%-66% without performance loss.

Conclusion: AirCache outperforms existing methods, especially at lower cache retention rates, offering efficient LVLM inference.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained
significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and
proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual
tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational
overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address
this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression
method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically
investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the
attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable
redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these
tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context
generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation
window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,
focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced
multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise
budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of
token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to
uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the
full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing
decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of
inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits

*Yiming Zhou, Yuexing Peng, Daqing Ge, Junchuan Yu, Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method (HPCL-Net) improves landslide detection using hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning and fusion of remote sensing and elevation data, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landslides cause significant losses, but detecting relic landslides is challenging due to visual blur and small datasets.

Method: HPCL-Net uses hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning to enhance local feature extraction and fuses heterogeneous data for better semantic segmentation.

Result: HPCL-Net increases mIoU from 0.620 to 0.651, Landslide IoU from 0.334 to 0.394, and F1-score from 0.501 to 0.565.

Conclusion: HPCL-Net effectively improves landslide detection accuracy, offering a reliable solution for risk warning.

Abstract: As a natural disaster, landslide often brings tremendous losses to human
lives, so it urgently demands reliable detection of landslide risks. When
detecting relic landslides that present important information for landslide
risk warning, problems such as visual blur and small-sized dataset cause great
challenges when using remote sensing images. To extract accurate semantic
features, a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation
network (HPCL-Net) is proposed, which augments the local salient feature
extraction from boundaries of landslides through HPCL and fuses heterogeneous
information in the semantic space from high-resolution remote sensing images
and digital elevation model data. For full utilization of precious samples, a
global hyper-pixel-wise sample pair queues-based contrastive learning method is
developed, which includes the construction of global queues that store
hyper-pixel-wise samples and the updating scheme of a momentum encoder,
reliably enhancing the extraction ability of semantic features. The proposed
HPCL-Net is evaluated on the Loess Plateau relic landslide dataset and
experimental results verify that the proposed HPCL-Net greatly outperforms
existing models, where the mIoU is increased from 0.620 to 0.651, the Landslide
IoU is improved from 0.334 to 0.394 and the F1score is enhanced from 0.501 to
0.565.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JointDiT is a diffusion transformer that jointly models RGB and depth distributions, achieving high-fidelity images and accurate depth maps through adaptive scheduling weights and unbalanced timestep sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve joint generation of RGB images and depth maps by leveraging diffusion transformers and addressing modality-specific noise levels.

Method: Uses adaptive scheduling weights and unbalanced timestep sampling to train across all noise levels for each modality, enabling flexible generation tasks.

Result: Outstanding joint generation performance and comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation.

Conclusion: Joint distribution modeling can replace conditional generation, offering versatility in combinatorial tasks.

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint
distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional
generation. The project page is available at

*Haoxuan Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Zhihang Yuan, Junyi Wu, Junchi Yan, Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the high memory and computational overhead of diffusion models by proposing a weight finetuning method to balance activation distributions for efficient low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods struggle with low-bit efficiency due to imbalanced activation distributions, hindering practical deployment of diffusion models.

Method: The authors adjust activation distributions via weight finetuning, focusing on quantized layers critical for temporal information and bit-width sensitivity, using local and global supervision.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution image generation tasks across various bit-widths.

Conclusion: Weight finetuning is a practical solution for improving quantization efficiency in diffusion models without significant performance loss.

Abstract: The practical deployment of diffusion models is still hindered by the high
memory and computational overhead. Although quantization paves a way for model
compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving
low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced
activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and
propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more
quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence
supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this
approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those
responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly
sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under
both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while
enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across
three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art
performance across multiple bit-width settings.

*Murat Onur Yildirim, Elif Ceren Gok Yildirim, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Joaquin Vanschoren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SERENA, a novel method inspired by brain neurogenesis, prevents catastrophic forgetting in neural networks by encoding concepts in specialized 'concept cells' within a single network, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in neural networks during continuous learning without task cues, emulating human-like learning.

Method: Encodes each concept in specialized 'concept cells' within an over-parameterized network, freezing learned cells to prevent forgetting. Introduces new continual learning scenarios with varying sample sizes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten benchmarks and surpasses offline supervised batch learning.

Conclusion: SERENA effectively prevents forgetting and excels in realistic continual learning scenarios, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning
sequences of tasks or data streams, unlike humans who can continuously learn
and consolidate new concepts even in the absence of explicit cues. Online
data-incremental learning seeks to emulate this capability by processing each
sample only once, without having access to task or stream cues at any point in
time since this is more realistic compared to offline setups, where all data
from novel class(es) is assumed to be readily available. However, existing
methods typically rely on storing the subsets of data in memory or expanding
the initial model architecture, resulting in significant computational
overhead. Drawing inspiration from 'self-regulated neurogenesis'-brain's
mechanism for creating specialized regions or circuits for distinct
functions-we propose a novel approach SERENA which encodes each concept in a
specialized network path called 'concept cell', integrated into a single
over-parameterized network. Once a concept is learned, its corresponding
concept cell is frozen, effectively preventing the forgetting of previously
acquired information. Furthermore, we introduce two new continual learning
scenarios that more closely reflect real-world conditions, characterized by
gradually changing sample sizes. Experimental results show that our method not
only establishes new state-of-the-art results across ten benchmarks but also
remarkably surpasses offline supervised batch learning performance. The code is

*Amin Karimi Monsefi, Mridul Khurana, Rajiv Ramnath, Anuj Karpatne, Wei-Lun Chao, Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaxaDiffusion is a taxonomy-guided framework for diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high accuracy by leveraging hierarchical taxonomic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat species as independent categories, ignoring visual similarities and subtle variations among them. TaxaDiffusion aims to exploit these relationships for better image generation.

Method: TaxaDiffusion trains diffusion models hierarchically, starting from broad taxonomic levels (Class, Order) and refining to specific levels (Family, Genus, Species) to capture shared and distinct traits.

Result: TaxaDiffusion outperforms existing methods, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation, even with limited training samples per species.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach of TaxaDiffusion effectively leverages taxonomic knowledge for accurate and high-quality fine-grained animal image generation.

Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for
diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological
and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an
independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many
species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in
subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,
TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across
different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class
and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at
the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures
coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,
facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for
species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate
generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive
experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms
existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image
generation. Project page: https://amink8.github.io/TaxaDiffusion/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty estimation technique and extends multi-hypothesis tracking to improve long-term consistency and lineage tree reconstruction in cell tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tracking approaches lack long-term consistency and accurate lineage tree reconstruction due to reliance on local accuracy metrics.

Method: The authors propose uncertainty estimation for motion estimation and a mitosis-aware assignment problem in multi-hypothesis tracking, incorporating biological knowledge into assignment costs.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a factor of ~6 on nine datasets, with significant improvements in biologically inspired metrics.

Conclusion: The framework enhances tracking accuracy and provides new insights into motion estimation uncertainty, addressing key limitations in cell tracking.

Abstract: Cell tracking and segmentation assist biologists in extracting insights from
large-scale microscopy time-lapse data. Driven by local accuracy metrics,
current tracking approaches often suffer from a lack of long-term consistency
and the ability to reconstruct lineage trees correctly. To address this issue,
we introduce an uncertainty estimation technique for motion estimation
frameworks and extend the multi-hypothesis tracking framework. Our uncertainty
estimation lifts motion representations into probabilistic spatial densities
using problem-specific test-time augmentations. Moreover, we introduce a novel
mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation that allows multi-hypothesis
trackers to model cell splits and to resolve false associations and mitosis
detections based on long-term conflicts. In our framework, explicit biological
knowledge is modeled in assignment costs. We evaluate our approach on nine
competitive datasets and demonstrate that we outperform the current
state-of-the-art on biologically inspired metrics substantially, achieving
improvements by a factor of approximately 6 and uncover new insights into the
behavior of motion estimation uncertainty.

TL;DR: A simple yet effective zero-shot image classification method using multimodal LLMs, achieving significant accuracy gains over benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage multimodal LLMs for zero-shot image classification without dataset-specific prompt engineering.

Method: Generates textual representations from images, converts them to fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal space, and fuses them for classification using a linear classifier.

Result: Achieved an average accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points across ten benchmarks, with 6.8 points on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs can significantly improve zero-shot image classification, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer
vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a
simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using
multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual
representations from input images. These textual representations are then
utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding
space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot
classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt
engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of
prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and
our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark
accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method
achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8
percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods
re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of
multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image
classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpticalRS-13M, a large-scale remote sensing dataset, and SelectiveMAE, an efficient MIM method, to improve foundational visual models in remote sensing by addressing dataset limitations and computational inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing datasets are limited in size and diversity, and conventional MIM methods are computationally inefficient due to redundant background pixels.

Method: The authors curate OpticalRS-13M, a 13M-image dataset, and propose SelectiveMAE, which dynamically encodes and reconstructs semantically rich patches to reduce computational overhead.

Result: OpticalRS-13M enhances performance in classification, detection, and segmentation, while SelectiveMAE improves training efficiency by over 2x.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective and scalable for developing foundational models in remote sensing, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has become an essential method for building
foundational visual models in remote sensing (RS). However, the limitations in
size and diversity of existing RS datasets restrict the ability of MIM methods
to learn generalizable representations. Additionally, conventional MIM
techniques, which require reconstructing all tokens, introduce unnecessary
computational overhead. To address these issues, we present a new pre-training
pipeline for RS models, featuring the creation of a large-scale RS dataset and
an efficient MIM approach. We curated a high-quality dataset named
\textbf{OpticalRS-13M} by collecting publicly available RS datasets and
processing them through exclusion, slicing, and deduplication. OpticalRS-13M
comprises 13 million optical images covering various RS tasks, such as object
detection and pixel segmentation. To enhance efficiency, we propose
\textbf{SelectiveMAE}, a pre-training method that dynamically encodes and
reconstructs semantically rich patch tokens, thereby reducing the
inefficiencies of traditional MIM models caused by redundant background pixels
in RS images. Extensive experiments show that OpticalRS-13M significantly
improves classification, detection, and segmentation performance, while
SelectiveMAE increases training efficiency over 2$\times$ times. This
highlights the effectiveness and scalability of our pipeline in developing RS
foundational models. The dataset, source code, and trained models will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods oversmooth geometry or produce artifacts; CanFields aims to improve fine-detailed geometry and deformation accuracy.

Method: Uses a dynamic consolidator module and diffeomorphic flow parameterized by a smooth velocity field for unsupervised fitting.

Result: Validated on 50+ sequences, showing robustness with missing regions, noise, and sparse data.

Conclusion: CanFields outperforms prior methods in accuracy and robustness for 3D shape interpolation.

Abstract: We introduce Canonical Consolidation Fields (CanFields). This novel method
interpolates arbitrary-length sequences of independently sampled 3D point
clouds into a unified, continuous, and coherent deforming shape. Unlike prior
methods that oversmooth geometry or produce topological and geometric
artifacts, CanFields optimizes fine-detailed geometry and deformation jointly
in an unsupervised fitting with two novel bespoke modules. First, we introduce
a dynamic consolidator module that adjusts the input and assigns confidence
scores, balancing the optimization of the canonical shape and its motion.
Second, we represent the motion as a diffeomorphic flow parameterized by a
smooth velocity field. We have validated our robustness and accuracy on more
than 50 diverse sequences, demonstrating its superior performance even with
missing regions, noisy raw scans, and sparse data. Our project page is at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAN-RM is a reward modeling framework for visual generative models that avoids manual preference annotation and explicit quality engineering by using adversarial training with a small set of target samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward modeling methods are complex, relying on extensive human annotations or engineered quality dimensions, which are incomplete and labor-intensive.

Method: GAN-RM trains a reward model by discriminating between a small set of unpaired target samples (Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated outputs, requiring minimal data.

Result: GAN-RM is effective for applications like Best-of-N filtering, Supervised Fine-Tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization.

Conclusion: GAN-RM offers a simpler, efficient alternative to traditional reward modeling, reducing reliance on manual effort while maintaining performance.

Abstract: An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for
post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current
approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to
their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously
engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and
engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative
adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward
modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit
quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through
discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target
samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs,
requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications
including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering,
post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Code and data will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Teacher-Student paradigm is proposed for high-resolution anomaly detection, leveraging pre-trained features efficiently while outperforming competitors in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downsampling images for anomaly detection can miss small defects; the paper aims to address this by efficiently processing high-resolution images without losing detection capability.

Method: Two shallow MLPs (Students) are trained to mimic patch embeddings from a frozen vision Transformer (Teacher), creating a challenging pretext task for anomaly detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD and best segmentation on VisA, with superior speed and robustness to defect size.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances high-resolution processing and anomaly detection, outperforming existing approaches in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: To efficiently deploy strong, often pre-trained feature extractors, recent
Industrial Anomaly Detection and Segmentation (IADS) methods process
low-resolution images, e.g., 224x224 pixels, obtained by downsampling the
original input images. However, while numerous industrial applications demand
the identification of both large and small defects, downsampling the input
image to a low resolution may hinder a method's ability to pinpoint tiny
anomalies. We propose a novel Teacher--Student paradigm to leverage strong
pre-trained features while processing high-resolution input images very
efficiently. The core idea concerns training two shallow MLPs (the Students) by
nominal images so as to mimic the mappings between the patch embeddings induced
by the self-attention layers of a frozen vision Transformer (the Teacher).
Indeed, learning these mappings sets forth a challenging pretext task that
small-capacity models are unlikely to accomplish on out-of-distribution data
such as anomalous images. Our method can spot anomalies from high-resolution
images and runs way faster than competitors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on MVTec AD and the best segmentation results on VisA. We also
propose novel evaluation metrics to capture robustness to defect size, i.e.,
the ability to preserve good localisation from large anomalies to tiny ones.
Evaluating our method also by these metrics reveals its neatly superior
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for field boundary delineation rely heavily on manual cloud-free data curation and lack adaptability to diverse conditions.

Method: PTAViT3D processes 3D time series from Sentinel-1/2, while PTAViT3D-CA adds cross-attention for data fusion. Both use a memory-efficient 3D Vision Transformer.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on datasets like ePaddocks, Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms, with strong global transferability.

Conclusion: The models simplify workflows by handling cloud-contaminated imagery and adapt well to diverse agricultural environments.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries is essential for
effective crop monitoring and resource management. However, competing
methodologies often face significant challenges, particularly in their reliance
on extensive manual efforts for cloud-free data curation and limited
adaptability to diverse global conditions. In this paper, we introduce
PTAViT3D, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing
three-dimensional time series of satellite imagery from either Sentinel-1 (S1)
or Sentinel-2 (S2). Additionally, we present PTAViT3D-CA, an extension of the
PTAViT3D model incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse S1 and S2
datasets, enhancing robustness in cloud-contaminated scenarios. The proposed
methods leverage spatio-temporal correlations through a memory-efficient 3D
Vision Transformer architecture, facilitating accurate boundary delineation
directly from raw, cloud-contaminated imagery. We comprehensively validate our
models through extensive testing on various datasets, including Australia's
ePaddocks - CSIRO's national agricultural field boundary product - alongside
public benchmarks Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms. Our results
consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting excellent
global transferability and robustness. Crucially, our approach significantly
simplifies data preparation workflows by reliably processing cloud-affected
imagery, thereby offering strong adaptability across diverse agricultural
environments. Our code and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes ToMiE, a method to enhance SMPL's ability to model 3D humans with hand-held objects or loose clothing by adaptively expanding the skeleton's joint tree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMPL models struggle with hand-held objects and loose clothing due to their decoupled movement from the human body.

Method: ToMiE uses gradient-based parent joint localization and SE(3) optimization for external joints.

Result: ToMiE outperforms other methods in rendering quality and enables free animation of grown joints.

Conclusion: ToMiE enhances SMPL's expressive ability for broader applications involving complex 3D human tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we highlight a critical yet often overlooked factor in most 3D
human tasks, namely modeling complicated 3D human with with hand-held objects
or loose-fitting clothing. It is known that the parameterized formulation of
SMPL is able to fit human skin; while hand-held objects and loose-fitting
clothing, are difficult to get modeled within the unified framework, since
their movements are usually decoupled with the human body. To enhance the
capability of SMPL skeleton in response to this situation, we propose a growth
strategy that enables the joint tree of the skeleton to expand adaptively.
Specifically, our method, called ToMiE, consists of parent joints localization
and external joints optimization. For parent joints localization, we employ a
gradient-based approach guided by both LBS blending weights and motion kernels.
Once the external joints are obtained, we proceed to optimize their
transformations in SE(3) across different frames, enabling rendering and
explicit animation. ToMiE manages to outperform other methods across various
cases with hand-held objects and loose-fitting clothing, not only in rendering
quality but also by offering free animation of grown joints, thereby enhancing
the expressive ability of SMPL skeleton for a broader range of applications.

Motivation: Existing BEV methods struggle with detecting objects similar to the background from a camera perspective.

Method: Proposes ROA-BEV, a network with 2D Region-Oriented Attention and multi-scale structures to enhance feature learning.

Result: ROA-BEV outperforms BEVDepth on nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: ROA-BEV effectively improves 3D object detection by focusing on relevant regions and leveraging multi-scale features.

Abstract: Vision-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) 3D object detection has recently become
popular in autonomous driving. However, objects with a high similarity to the
background from a camera perspective cannot be detected well by existing
methods. In this paper, we propose a BEV-based 3D Object Detection Network with
2D Region-Oriented Attention (ROA-BEV), which enables the backbone to focus
more on feature learning of the regions where objects exist. Moreover, our
method further enhances the information feature learning ability of ROA through
multi-scale structures. Each block of ROA utilizes a large kernel to ensure
that the receptive field is large enough to catch information about large
objects. Experiments on nuScenes show that ROA-BEV improves the performance
based on BEVDepth. The source codes of this work will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) and proposes a supervised method to learn task-specific operators on a manifold, improving performance in tasks like retrieval and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LBO's invariancy under isometric deformations limits its real-world applicability, prompting the need for task-specific adaptations.

Method: A supervised approach is introduced to learn manifold operators, optimizing the LBO eigenbasis for specific tasks.

Result: The optimized LBO significantly enhances established descriptors like the heat kernel signature in tasks such as retrieval and segmentation.

Conclusion: Adapting the LBO eigenbasis to task-specific needs improves performance in both global and local learning settings.

Abstract: The Laplace-Beltrami operator has established itself in the field of
non-rigid shape analysis due to its many useful properties such as being
invariant under isometric transformation, having a countable eigensystem
forming an orthornormal basis, and fully characterizing geodesic distances of
the manifold. However, this invariancy only applies under isometric
deformations, which leads to a performance breakdown in many real-world
applications. In recent years emphasis has been placed upon extracting optimal
features using deep learning methods,however spectral signatures play a crucial
role and still add value. In this paper we take a step back, revisiting the LBO
and proposing a supervised way to learn several operators on a manifold.
Depending on the task, by applying these functions, we can train the LBO
eigenbasis to be more task-specific. The optimization of the LBO leads to
enormous improvements to established descriptors such as the heat kernel
signature in various tasks such as retrieval, classification, segmentation, and
correspondence, proving the adaption of the LBO eigenbasis to both global and
highly local learning settings.

Abstract: Remote sensing foundation models largely break away from the traditional

multiple tasks. However, they face challenges such as low computational
efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with
large-scale remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from
heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on
this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel
computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in
high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient
multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies
the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a
global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote
sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the
frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a
self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and
multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and
performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets.
Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduce memory
usage by 84\%, FLOPs by 24\% and improves throughput by 2.7 times. The code
will be made publicly available.

*Chang-Bin Zhang, Yujie Zhong, Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-route training mechanism for detection transformers, combining one-to-one and one-to-many predictions, with auxiliary routes for enhanced training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection transformers by investigating the roles of decoder components and proposing a flexible multi-task framework.

Method: Multi-route training with primary and auxiliary routes, instructive self-attention, and route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).

Result: Consistent improvements in object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: The method is flexible, effective, and adaptable to various tasks.

Abstract: Existing methods enhance the training of detection transformers by
incorporating an auxiliary one-to-many assignment. In this work, we treat the
model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and
one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the
transformer decoder across these two training targets, including
self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical
results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can
effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are
shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism,
featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training
routes for one-to-many prediction. We propose a novel instructive
self-attention mechanism, integrated into the first auxiliary route, which
dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. For
the second auxiliary route, we introduce a route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
to facilitate knowledge sharing while mitigating potential conflicts between
routes. Additionally, we apply an MoE to low-scale features in the encoder,
optimizing the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The auxiliary
routes are discarded during inference. We conduct extensive experiments across
various object detection baselines, achieving consistent improvements as
demonstrated in Fig. 1. Our method is highly flexible and can be readily
adapted to other tasks. To demonstrate its versatility, we conduct experiments
on both instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation, further validating its
effectiveness. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/mrdetr/

*Zhangjun Zhou, Yiping Li, Chunlin Zhong, Jianuo Huang, Jialun Pei, Hua Li, He Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of disentangling salient and camouflaged object detection in models, proposing a new dataset (USC12K) and model (USCNet) with explicit attribute relationship modeling and a new evaluation metric (CSCS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to differentiate between salient and camouflaged objects due to dataset constraints and lack of explicit relationship modeling.

Method: Constructs USC12K dataset with comprehensive labels and proposes USCNet, featuring prompt query mechanisms for attribute relationships and a new CSCS metric.

Result: USCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenes in various metrics.

Conclusion: The work advances unconstrained salient and camouflaged object detection with improved modeling and evaluation.

Abstract: While the human visual system employs distinct mechanisms to perceive salient
and camouflaged objects, existing models struggle to disentangle these tasks.
Specifically, salient object detection (SOD) models frequently misclassify
camouflaged objects as salient, while camouflaged object detection (COD) models
conversely misinterpret salient objects as camouflaged. We hypothesize that
this can be attributed to two factors: (i) the specific annotation paradigm of
current SOD and COD datasets, and (ii) the lack of explicit attribute
relationship modeling in current models. Prevalent SOD/COD datasets enforce a
mutual exclusivity constraint, assuming scenes contain either salient or
camouflaged objects, which poorly aligns with the real world. Furthermore,
current SOD/COD methods are primarily designed for these highly constrained
datasets and lack explicit modeling of the relationship between salient and
camouflaged objects. In this paper, to promote the development of unconstrained
salient and camouflaged object detection, we construct a large-scale dataset,
USC12K, which features comprehensive labels and four different scenes that
cover all possible logical existence scenarios of both salient and camouflaged
objects. To explicitly model the relationship between salient and camouflaged
objects, we propose a model called USCNet, which introduces two distinct prompt
query mechanisms for modeling inter-sample and intra-sample attribute
relationships. Additionally, to assess the model's ability to distinguish
between salient and camouflaged objects, we design an evaluation metric called
CSCS. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all
scenes in various metrics. The code and dataset will be available at
https://github.com/ssecv/USCNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SweepEvGS leverages event cameras for robust novel view synthesis from a single sweep, outperforming existing methods in quality, speed, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that require dense, high-quality images, especially in dynamic environments.

Method: Uses event cameras to capture initial static frames and dense event streams during a single sweep for detailed scene reconstruction.

Result: Demonstrates superior visual rendering quality, speed, and computational efficiency in synthetic and real-world settings.

Conclusion: SweepEvGS is a promising solution for dynamic practical applications, offering reliability and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have demonstrated the
potential of using 3D Gaussian primitives for high-speed, high-fidelity, and
cost-efficient novel view synthesis from continuously calibrated input views.
However, conventional methods require high-frame-rate dense and high-quality
sharp images, which are time-consuming and inefficient to capture, especially
in dynamic environments. Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and
ability to capture asynchronous brightness changes, offer a promising
alternative for more reliable scene reconstruction without motion blur. In this
paper, we propose SweepEvGS, a novel hardware-integrated method that leverages
event cameras for robust and accurate novel view synthesis across various
imaging settings from a single sweep. SweepEvGS utilizes the initial static
frame with dense event streams captured during a single camera sweep to
effectively reconstruct detailed scene views. We also introduce different
real-world hardware imaging systems for real-world data collection and
evaluation for future research. We validate the robustness and efficiency of
SweepEvGS through experiments in three different imaging settings: synthetic
objects, real-world macro-level, and real-world micro-level view synthesis. Our
results demonstrate that SweepEvGS surpasses existing methods in visual
rendering quality, rendering speed, and computational efficiency, highlighting
its potential for dynamic practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A bioinspired dual-drive hybrid network (BDHNet) is proposed for motion deblurring using event cameras, combining SNNs for motion features and ANNs for color processing, with dynamic neuron adjustment and unsupervised blurry region attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in cross-modal feature fusion for motion deblurring caused by non-uniform event data distribution and redundancy.

Method: Uses SNNs for motion feature extraction and ANNs for color processing, introducing Neuron Configurator Module (NCM) and Region of Blurry Attention Module (RBAM) for dynamic adaptation and unsupervised blurry region focus.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets in subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: BDHNet effectively leverages event data for motion deblurring, demonstrating superior performance through bioinspired dynamic adaptation and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Motion deblurring addresses the challenge of image blur caused by camera or
scene movement. Event cameras provide motion information that is encoded in the
asynchronous event streams. To efficiently leverage the temporal information of
event streams, we employ Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for motion feature
extraction and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for color information
processing. Due to the non-uniform distribution and inherent redundancy of
event data, existing cross-modal feature fusion methods exhibit certain
limitations. Inspired by the visual attention mechanism in the human visual
system, this study introduces a bioinspired dual-drive hybrid network (BDHNet).
Specifically, the Neuron Configurator Module (NCM) is designed to dynamically
adjusts neuron configurations based on cross-modal features, thereby focusing
the spikes in blurry regions and adapting to varying blurry scenarios
dynamically. Additionally, the Region of Blurry Attention Module (RBAM) is
introduced to generate a blurry mask in an unsupervised manner, effectively
extracting motion clues from the event features and guiding more accurate
cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning approaches for microstructure-property relationships are task-specific, requiring expensive training. The goal is to leverage pre-trained foundational vision transformers for more efficient and robust solutions.

Method: Utilizes pre-trained vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) to extract microstructure features, followed by lightweight machine learning for property prediction. Tested on elastic modulus and Vicker's hardness case studies.

Result: Demonstrates robust microstructure representation and efficient property prediction without task-specific training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Foundational vision transformers offer a promising approach for microstructure-property relationship learning, reducing the need for expensive custom models.

Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an
emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine
learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each
microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained
foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic
microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a
microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained
state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on
machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on
simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys
based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the
potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure
representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property
relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or
fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for speech-driven 3D facial animation are slow, limiting practical applications.

Method: Uses an autoregressive model mapping speech to a multi-scale motion codebook for synchronized lip movements, head poses, and eye blinks.

Result: Achieves real-time generation, adapts to unseen speaking styles, and outperforms existing methods in accuracy and perceived quality.

Conclusion: The model enables high-quality, real-time 3D talking avatars with unique styles, surpassing current approaches.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic lip movements
and facial expressions for 3D head models from arbitrary audio clips. Although
existing diffusion-based methods are capable of producing natural motions,
their slow generation speed limits their application potential. In this paper,
we introduce a novel autoregressive model that achieves real-time generation of
highly synchronized lip movements and realistic head poses and eye blinks by
learning a mapping from speech to a multi-scale motion codebook. Furthermore,
our model can adapt to unseen speaking styles, enabling the creation of 3D
talking avatars with unique personal styles beyond the identities seen during
training. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches in lip synchronization accuracy and perceived
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyCalib is a method for calibrating camera intrinsics from a single image, agnostic to camera models, outperforming existing methods with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current calibration methods are model-specific or require extrinsic cues, limiting their applicability. AnyCalib leverages inherent image cues for broader usability.

Method: Frames calibration as regression of pixel rays, enabling closed-form recovery of intrinsics for various camera models, including edited images.

Result: Outperforms alternative methods, including 3D foundation models, despite less training data.

Conclusion: AnyCalib provides a versatile, data-efficient solution for camera calibration from single images.

Abstract: We present AnyCalib, a method for calibrating the intrinsic parameters of a
camera from a single in-the-wild image, that is agnostic to the camera model.
Current methods are predominantly tailored to specific camera models and/or
require extrinsic cues, such as the direction of gravity, to be visible in the
image. In contrast, we argue that the perspective and distortion cues inherent
in images are sufficient for model-agnostic camera calibration. To demonstrate
this, we frame the calibration process as the regression of the rays
corresponding to each pixel. We show, for the first time, that this
intermediate representation allows for a closed-form recovery of the intrinsics
for a wide range of camera models, including but not limited to: pinhole,
Brown-Conrady and Kannala-Brandt. Our approach also applies to edited --
cropped and stretched -- images. Experimentally, we demonstrate that AnyCalib
consistently outperforms alternative methods, including 3D foundation models,
despite being trained on orders of magnitude less data. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE for UHD image restoration, addressing information loss and degradation coupling in VAEs, achieving state-of-the-art results with 1M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAE-based methods for UHD image restoration suffer from uncontrollable information loss and degradation coupling, leading to poor restoration quality.

Method: Uses Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide VAE, along with a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network for background consistency.

Result: Effectively alleviates information loss, improves restoration quality, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The method enhances VAE performance for UHD restoration, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration often faces computational
bottlenecks and information loss due to its extremely high resolution. Existing
studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by
transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space.
However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in
degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain
during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often
exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address
this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which
utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal
Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable
background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded
information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible
Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their
consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the
degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively
alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring
computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image
restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks
with only 1M parameters.

TL;DR: A novel approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation in apple orchards using 3D data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and providing a public dataset and open-source implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crop yield estimation is crucial for farming decisions, and robots can automate this by perceiving and segmenting target objects like trees and fruits.

Method: The approach combines semantic and instance segmentation of trunks, fruits, and trees in 3D data from various sensors, capturing hierarchical relationships.

Result: The method outperforms existing 3D panoptic segmentation techniques in agriculture and provides detailed hierarchical segmentation.

Conclusion: The approach and dataset advance automated yield estimation in orchards, with publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Crop yield estimation is a relevant problem in agriculture, because an
accurate yield estimate can support farmers' decisions on harvesting or
precision intervention. Robots can help to automate this process. To do so,
they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target
objects such as trees and plants. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach
to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards
on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously
provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and
instance segmentation of trees (a trunk with its fruits). This allows us to
identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks,
and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number
of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. To efficiently evaluate our
approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed
specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn, Germany, in a real
apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser
scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robots platforms. The
experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D
panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full
hierarchical panoptic segmentation. Our dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: A simulator-conditioned scene generation engine using world models is proposed to address data scarcity in autonomous driving, improving perception model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of diverse and large-scale data hinders perception model accuracy in autonomous driving.

Method: A simulator-conditioned scene generation engine combines simulation capabilities with world model data generation, creating realistic datasets.

Result: Generated images enhance downstream perception models, with benchmarks showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the gap between simulation and real-world data, with potential for urban autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, a lack of data
has become a major obstacle to enhancing perception model accuracy. Researchers
are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify
datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation
quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research
on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to
achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a
simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed.
By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes,
simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation
in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data
generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of
the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world
model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and
real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in
real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images
significantly improve downstream perception models performance. Finally, we
explored the generative performance of the world model in urban autonomous
driving scenarios. All the data and code will be available at

TL;DR: A lightweight video semantic segmentation method (SSP) for aerial data improves temporal consistency and accuracy using Semantic Similarity Propagation and Knowledge Distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring stable and reliable semantic segmentation predictions for autonomous flying vehicles is critical for trustworthiness.

Method: SSP propagates predictions across frames with global registration alignment and linear interpolation. Knowledge Distillation leverages labeled and unlabeled frames for training.

Result: KD-SSP achieves 12.5% and 6.7% higher temporal consistency on UAVid and RuralScapes, with comparable speed.

Conclusion: KD-SSP offers superior segmentation quality and speed trade-off for aerial data compared to general video methods.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation from RGB cameras is essential to the perception of
autonomous flying vehicles. The stability of predictions through the captured
videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the
trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video
semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving
high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity
Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an
efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to
compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the
prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the
features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a
challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation
training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a
large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we
leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the
same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP
obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image
segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively,
with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets,
KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off
than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows
considerably higher consistency. Project page:

TL;DR: DWIM improves visual reasoning by addressing limitations of frozen LLMs through discrepancy-aware training and instruct-masking fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in visual reasoning, leading to performance bottlenecks due to limited data, imperfect tools, and noisy workflows.

Method: DWIM introduces discrepancy-aware training workflow generation and instruct-masking fine-tuning to enhance tool usage and action cloning.

Result: DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various VR tasks and shows strong generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: DWIM effectively addresses LLM limitations in VR, offering a practical solution for improved visual reasoning.

Abstract: Visual reasoning (VR), which is crucial in many fields for enabling
human-like visual understanding, remains highly challenging. Recently,
compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning
abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve
problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR
methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool
awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for
reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to
VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and
reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on
noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i)
Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and
extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking
fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling
the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting
strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.

Motivation: Assess MLLMs' capability in precise spatial-temporal understanding for real-world applications like Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving.

Method: Introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark with tasks estimating object appearance, pose, displacement, and motion across diverse scenarios.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs perform poorly in real-world spatial-temporal tasks, particularly in precise distance and motion analysis.

Conclusion: MLLMs need improvement for accurate spatial-temporal understanding in practical applications.

Abstract: The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution
for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While
MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks,
their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal

uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we
introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal
understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the
appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark
encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop,
indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the
state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal
understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how T2I models represent diverse nationalities and identify biases in their outputs.

Method: Generated 644 images from prompts specifying nationalities, analyzed representation patterns, and used CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1 mini for alignment scores.

Result: Significant bias toward traditional attire (52.88% and 27.4% in scenarios), with regional and income disparities. Higher alignment scores for traditional attire images.

Conclusion: T2I models prioritize traditional characteristics, revealing biases that disproportionately affect certain regions and income groups.

Abstract: This paper investigates how a popular Text-to-Image (T2I) model represents
people from 208 different nationalities when prompted to generate images of
individuals engaging in typical activities. Two scenarios were developed, and
644 images were generated based on input prompts that specified nationalities.
The results show that in one scenario, 52.88% of images, and in the other,
27.4%, depict individuals wearing traditional attire. A statistically
significant relationship was observed between this representation pattern and
regions. This indicates that the issue disproportionately affects certain
areas, particularly the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. A
notable association with income groups was also found. CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1
mini were used to measure alignment scores between generated images and 3320
prompts and captions, with findings indicating statistically significant higher
scores for images featuring individuals in traditional attire in one scenario.
The study also examined revised prompts, finding that the word "traditional"
was added by the model to 88.46% of prompts for one scenario. These findings
provide valuable insights into T2I models' representation of individuals across
different countries, demonstrating how the examined model prioritizes
traditional characteristics despite their impracticality for the given
activities.

*MinKyu Lee, Sangeek Hyun, Woojin Jun, Hyunjun Kim, Jiwoo Chung, Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies feature magnitude divergence and entropy collapse in IR Transformers due to conventional LayerNorm, proposing i-LN as a solution to stabilize training and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LayerNorm in IR Transformers causes feature divergence and entropy collapse, hindering accurate low-level feature preservation.

Method: Introduces i-LN, a modified LayerNorm normalizing features holistically across spatio-channel dimensions and using input-adaptive rescaling.

Result: i-LN stabilizes training dynamics and enhances IR Transformer performance across tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed i-LN effectively addresses LayerNorm mismatches, improving IR Transformer stability and accuracy.

Abstract: This work investigates the internal training dynamics of image
restoration~(IR) Transformers and uncovers a critical yet overlooked issue:
conventional LayerNorm leads feature magnitude divergence, up to a million
scale, and collapses channel-wise entropy. We analyze this phenomenon from the
perspective of networks attempting to bypass constraints imposed by
conventional LayerNorm due to conflicts against requirements in IR tasks.
Accordingly, we address two misalignments between LayerNorm and IR tasks, and
later show that addressing these mismatches leads to both stabilized training
dynamics and improved IR performance. Specifically, conventional LayerNorm
works in a per-token manner, disrupting spatial correlations between tokens,
essential in IR tasks. Also, it employs an input-independent normalization that
restricts the flexibility of feature scales, required to preserve
input-specific statistics. Together, these mismatches significantly hinder IR
Transformer's ability to accurately preserve low-level features throughout the
network. To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer
Normalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for
conventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner
across the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships
among individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling
strategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual
inputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving
low-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental
results verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and
performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.

*Yongkang Dai, Xiaoshui Huang, Yunpeng Bai, Hao Guo, Hongping Gan, Ling Yang, Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRepFormer is a transformer-based model for recognizing machining and complex CAD features, outperforming previous methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods focused on Machining Feature Recognition (MFR) but lacked effectiveness in capturing complex geometric and topological features.

Method: BRepFormer encodes and fuses geometric and topological features, using a transformer architecture with a bias combining edge and topology features for recognition.

Result: BRepFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on MFInstSeg, MFTRCAD, and the newly proposed CBF dataset.

Conclusion: BRepFormer effectively addresses the limitations of prior work and aligns better with industrial applications through its innovative approach and dataset.

Abstract: Recognizing geometric features on B-rep models is a cornerstone technique for
multimedia content-based retrieval and has been widely applied in intelligent
manufacturing. However, previous research often merely focused on Machining
Feature Recognition (MFR), falling short in effectively capturing the intricate
topological and geometric characteristics of complex geometry features. In this
paper, we propose BRepFormer, a novel transformer-based model to recognize both
machining feature and complex CAD models' features. BRepFormer encodes and
fuses the geometric and topological features of the models. Afterwards,
BRepFormer utilizes a transformer architecture for feature propagation and a
recognition head to identify geometry features. During each iteration of the
transformer, we incorporate a bias that combines edge features and topology
features to reinforce geometric constraints on each face. In addition, we also
proposed a dataset named Complex B-rep Feature Dataset (CBF), comprising 20,000
B-rep models. By covering more complex B-rep models, it is better aligned with
industrial applications. The experimental results demonstrate that BRepFormer
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MFInstSeg, MFTRCAD, and our CBF
datasets.

### [228] [Efficient Spiking Point Mamba for Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14371)
*Peixi Wu, Bosong Chai, Menghua Zheng, Wei Li, Zhangchi Hu, Jie Chen, Zheyu Zhang, Hebei Li, Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), a Mamba-based Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for 3D spatio-temporal feature extraction, addressing long-range dependencies and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D SNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Mamba's computational efficiency and sequence modeling capabilities offer a promising solution.

Method: SPM combines Mamba's sequence modeling with SNNs' temporal feature extraction using Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE) and Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), along with an asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture for training.

Result: SPM outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs by +6.2%, +6.1%, and +7.4% on ScanObjectNN variants and +1.9% on ShapeNetPart, with 3.5x lower energy consumption than ANNs.

Conclusion: SPM effectively integrates Mamba and SNNs, achieving superior performance and energy efficiency in 3D tasks.

Abstract: Bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way
to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing 3D SNNs have
struggled with long-range dependencies until the recent emergence of Mamba,
which offers superior computational efficiency and sequence modeling
capability. In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first
Mamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Due to the poor performance of simply
transferring Mamba to 3D SNNs, SPM is designed to utilize both the sequence
modeling capabilities of Mamba and the temporal feature extraction of SNNs.
Specifically, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an
improved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal
mechanism, thereby facilitating temporal interactions. Then, we propose a
Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning
inter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes.
Finally, to further enhance model performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN
architecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune. Compared with the
previous state-of-the-art SNN models, SPM improves OA by +6.2%, +6.1%, and
+7.4% on three variants of ScanObjectNN, and boosts instance mIOU by +1.9% on
ShapeNetPart. Meanwhile, its energy consumption is at least 3.5x lower than
that of its ANN counterpart. The code will be made publicly available.

*Tajamul Ashraf, Rajes Manna, Partha Sarathi Purkayastha, Tavaheed Tariq, Janibul Bashir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grounded Teacher (GT) to address context bias and performance drops in Source Free Object Detection (SFOD) by leveraging a relational context module and expert foundational branch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate biased teacher models and inaccurate pseudolabels in SFOD, especially in medical imaging with class imbalance and domain shifts.

Method: Uses a relational context module to model contextual relationships and an expert foundational branch to supervise the student model, applying augmentations to underrepresented classes.

Result: Validated on three medical datasets, GT improves performance for underrepresented classes while minimizing impact on dominant classes.

Conclusion: GT effectively mitigates context bias in SFOD, with resources publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: We focus on the Source Free Object Detection (SFOD) problem, when source data
is unavailable during adaptation, and the model must adapt to the unlabeled
target domain. In medical imaging, several approaches have leveraged a
semi-supervised student-teacher architecture to bridge domain discrepancy.
Context imbalance in labeled training data and significant domain shifts
between domains can lead to biased teacher models that produce inaccurate
pseudolabels, degrading the student model's performance and causing a mode
collapse. Class imbalance, particularly when one class significantly outnumbers
another, leads to contextual bias. To tackle the problem of context bias and
the significant performance drop of the student model in the SFOD setting, we
introduce Grounded Teacher (GT) as a standard framework. In this study, we
model contextual relationships using a dedicated relational context module and
leverage it to mitigate inherent biases in the model. This approach enables us
to apply augmentations to closely related classes, across and within domains,
enhancing the performance of underrepresented classes while keeping the effect
on dominant classes minimal. We further improve the quality of predictions by
implementing an expert foundational branch to supervise the student model. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating context bias under the
SFOD setting through experiments on three medical datasets supported by
comprehensive ablation studies. All relevant resources, including preprocessed
data, trained model weights, and code, are publicly available at this

### [230] [StateSpaceDiffuser: Bringing Long Context to Diffusion World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22246)
*Nedko Savov, Naser Kazemi, Deheng Zhang, Danda Pani Paudel, Xi Wang, Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StateSpaceDiffuser integrates state-space models with diffusion models to enhance long-term memory in world models, improving temporal coherence in generated scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models lose long-term context, causing generated scenes to drift from observed sequences.

Method: Combines diffusion models with state-space models to integrate interaction history, preserving high-fidelity synthesis.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-only baselines, maintaining coherent visual context for significantly more steps in 2D and 3D environments.

Conclusion: State-space representations in diffusion models effectively balance visual detail and long-term memory.

Abstract: World models have recently become promising tools for predicting realistic
visuals based on actions in complex environments. However, their reliance on
only a few recent observations leads them to lose track of the long-term
context. Consequently, in just a few steps the generated scenes drift from what
was previously observed, undermining the temporal coherence of the sequence.
This limitation of the state-of-the-art world models, most of which rely on
diffusion, comes from their lack of a lasting environment state. To address
this problem, we introduce StateSpaceDiffuser, where a diffusion model is
enabled to perform long-context tasks by integrating features from a
state-space model, representing the entire interaction history. This design
restores long-term memory while preserving the high-fidelity synthesis of
diffusion models. To rigorously measure temporal consistency, we develop an
evaluation protocol that probes a model's ability to reinstantiate seen content
in extended rollouts. Comprehensive experiments show that StateSpaceDiffuser
significantly outperforms a strong diffusion-only baseline, maintaining a
coherent visual context for an order of magnitude more steps. It delivers
consistent views in both a 2D maze navigation and a complex 3D environment.
These results establish that bringing state-space representations into
diffusion models is highly effective in demonstrating both visual details and
long-term memory.

*Yingjia Xu, Jinlin Wu, Zhen Chen, Daming Gao, Yang Yang, Zhen Lei, Min Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset, and SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework combining appearance grounding and scene-aware re-ranking for text-based person retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on appearance-based retrieval, ignoring contextual scene information, which can enhance accuracy.

Method: Proposes SA-Person: 1) appearance grounding via text-pedestrian alignment, 2) SceneRanker for scene-aware re-ranking using multimodal LLMs.

Result: Validated on SCENEPERSON-13W, the framework improves retrieval in complex scenes.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates appearance and scene context, advancing text-based person retrieval.

Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify a target individual from a
gallery of images based on a natural language description. It presents a
significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the
ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily
emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the
contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable
complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce
SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich
annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based
on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first
stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues
with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces
SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging
multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance
and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the
effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

*Chuanyu Fu, Yuqi Zhang, Kunbin Yao, Guanying Chen, Yuan Xiong, Chuan Huang, Shuguang Cui, Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSplat improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing transient object artifacts through delayed Gaussian growth and scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with transient objects, causing rendering artifacts. RobustSplat aims to mitigate these issues.

Method: Introduces delayed Gaussian growth and scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping for better transient object handling.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on challenging datasets, showing robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: RobustSplat successfully reduces artifacts and enhances rendering quality in scenes with transient objects.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its
real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by
transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify
that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture,
unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians
that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a
robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed
Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure
before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient
objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask
bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity
supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of
its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses
to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method
outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and
effectiveness of our method. Our project page is

*Olaf Dünkel, Thomas Wimmer, Christian Theobalt, Christian Rupprecht, Adam Kortylewski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D-aware pseudo-labeling method to improve semantic correspondence estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic matching across images is challenging, especially for symmetric or repeated objects, and existing methods lack robustness.

Method: An adapter refines off-the-shelf features using 3D-aware pseudo-labels, incorporating cyclic consistency and 3D spherical prototype constraints.

Result: Achieves over 4% absolute gain on SPair-71k and 7% improvement over similarly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The method simplifies training extension to other data sources and reduces annotation dependency.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoM2P is a masked modeling framework for egocentric 4D understanding, addressing challenges in multimodal data by using efficient temporal tokenizers. It outperforms specialist models in tasks like gaze prediction and video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric vision applications require understanding multimodal signals, but data heterogeneity and missing modalities make supervised learning difficult. Existing models struggle with dynamic camera motion and complex spatiotemporal structures.

Method: Introduces EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework with efficient temporal tokenizers, enabling multitasking across egocentric tasks like gaze prediction and video synthesis.

Result: EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models in tasks like gaze prediction and monocular depth estimation while being faster.

Conclusion: EgoM2P is a scalable, general-purpose solution for egocentric 4D understanding, advancing research with its open-source release.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction, enabling systems to better
interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and surrounding environment.
However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal and multitask models
presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently heterogeneous, with
large variations in modality coverage across devices and settings. Generating
pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or head-mounted camera
trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard supervised learning
approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera motion and the
complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video pose additional
challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally-aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video, and also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric video
synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models
while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source EgoM2P to
support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OneIG-Bench is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-to-image models across multiple dimensions like alignment, reasoning, and style, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for text-to-image models lack comprehensive evaluations, particularly in reasoning, text rendering, and style, prompting the need for a more systematic framework.

Method: OneIG-Bench is designed to evaluate T2I models across fine-grained dimensions (e.g., alignment, reasoning, style) and allows flexible, subset-focused evaluations.

Result: The benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, identifying strengths and bottlenecks in image generation pipelines.

Conclusion: OneIG-Bench facilitates reproducible evaluations and cross-model comparisons, advancing the T2I research community.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for novel view image and geometry generation using warping-and-inpainting, with cross-modal attention distillation for alignment and proximity-based mesh conditioning for robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior methods requiring dense posed images or pose-embedded models, enabling high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis and geometrically aligned outputs.

Method: Uses off-the-shelf geometry predictors, formulates novel-view synthesis as inpainting, and employs cross-modal attention distillation and proximity-based mesh conditioning.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity view synthesis, competitive reconstruction, and geometrically aligned colored point clouds for 3D completion.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates image and geometry generation, outperforming prior approaches in robustness and alignment.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

*Taiga Hayami, Kakeru Koizumi, Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural video representation method using Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs) to improve reconstruction quality and reduce boundary artifacts in implicit neural representations (INRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current INR methods for videos struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction and spatial coherence due to uniform patch partitioning.

Method: The method splits video frames into spatially aligned patches using a deterministic pixel-based splitting (similar to PixelUnshuffle), then trains a decoder for global-to-local reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show higher reconstruction quality and better compression performance compared to existing INR-based methods.

Conclusion: The SPP-based approach effectively addresses limitations of conventional patch-based methods, improving video representation quality.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) are the subject of extensive research,
particularly in their application to modeling complex signals by mapping
spatial and temporal coordinates to corresponding values. When handling videos,
mapping compact inputs to entire frames or spatially partitioned patch images
is an effective approach. This strategy better preserves spatial relationships,
reduces computational overhead, and improves reconstruction quality compared to
coordinate-based mapping. However, predicting entire frames often limits the
reconstruction of high-frequency visual details. Additionally, conventional
patch-based approaches based on uniform spatial partitioning tend to introduce
boundary discontinuities that degrade spatial coherence. We propose a neural
video representation method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs) to
address such limitations. Our method separates each video frame into patch
images of spatially aligned frames through a deterministic pixel-based
splitting similar to PixelUnshuffle. This operation preserves the global
spatial structure while allowing patch-level decoding. We train the decoder to
reconstruct these structured patches, enabling a global-to-local decoding
strategy that captures the global layout first and refines local details. This
effectively reduces boundary artifacts and mitigates distortions from naive
upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves higher reconstruction quality and better compression performance than
existing INR-based baselines.

TL;DR: DeSPITE explores multi-modal contrastive pre-training for human activity understanding using LiDAR, skeleton poses, IMU data, and text, achieving effective joint embedding and novel task capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR is underutilized in multi-modal contrastive pre-training for human activity understanding. This work aims to bridge this gap by integrating LiDAR with other modalities.

Method: DeSPITE, a joint embedding model, combines LiDAR point clouds, skeleton poses, IMU data, and text. It uses synchronized data from LIPD and Babel datasets.

Result: DeSPITE enables novel tasks like Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching and retrieval, and improves point cloud HAR performance in benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeSPITE successfully integrates multiple modalities for human activity understanding, demonstrating its potential as a pre-training strategy.

Abstract: Despite LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) being an effective
privacy-preserving alternative to RGB cameras to perceive human activities, it
remains largely underexplored in the context of multi-modal contrastive
pre-training for human activity understanding (e.g., human activity recognition
(HAR), retrieval, or person re-identification (RE-ID)). To close this gap, our
work explores learning the correspondence between LiDAR point clouds, human
skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space. More
specifically, we present DeSPITE, a Deep Skeleton-Pointcloud-IMU-Text Embedding
model, which effectively learns a joint embedding space across these four
modalities. At the heart of our empirical exploration, we have combined the
existing LIPD and Babel datasets, which enabled us to synchronize data of all
four modalities, allowing us to explore the learning of a new joint embedding
space. Our experiments demonstrate novel human activity understanding tasks for
point cloud sequences enabled through DeSPITE, including
Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching, retrieval, and temporal moment retrieval.
Furthermore, we show that DeSPITE is an effective pre-training strategy for
point cloud HAR through experiments in MSR-Action3D and HMPEAR.

*Peixiang Huang, Yanyan Huang, Weiqin Zhao, Junjun He, Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperPath leverages hyperbolic space and textual descriptions to model semantic hierarchies in whole slide images (WSIs), improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for WSI analysis rely on Euclidean embeddings, which inadequately capture semantic hierarchies. HyperPath addresses this by using hyperbolic space and textual guidance.

Method: HyperPath adapts visual and textual features to hyperbolic space, using Angular Modality Alignment Loss and Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss for cross-modal alignment and semantic coherence. Classification is done via geodesic distance.

Result: HyperPath outperforms existing methods in WSI classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperbolic embeddings.

Conclusion: HyperPath highlights the potential of hyperbolic space for enhancing WSI analysis by better capturing semantic hierarchies.

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

Abstract: High-dimensional image data often require dimensionality reduction before
further analysis. This paper provides a purely analytical comparison of two

TL;DR: MiCo is a novel MIL framework for histopathology WSI analysis, enhancing cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and inter-tissue semantic associations via context-aware clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of spatial heterogeneity in WSIs, where morphologically similar tissues are dispersed, which conventional MIL methods struggle to model.

Method: MiCo clusters instances to form semantic anchors, uses a Cluster Route module for cross-regional linking, and a Cluster Reducer to consolidate redundant anchors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nine cancer datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in capturing spatial interactions.

Conclusion: MiCo successfully addresses spatial heterogeneity in WSIs, improving cancer diagnosis and prognosis analysis.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.

### [242] [Referring Expression Instance Retrieval and A Strong End-to-End Baseline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18246)
*Xiangzhao Hao, Kuan Zhu, Hongyu Guo, Haiyun Guo, Ning Jiang, Quan Lu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task, Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR), combining instance-level retrieval and localization. It proposes a benchmark (REIRCOCO) and a baseline method (CLARE) for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require querying instance-level descriptions across large galleries, which existing methods (TIR and REC) fail to address effectively.

Method: A dual-stream architecture (CLARE) encodes referring expressions and detects candidate objects, optimizing retrieval via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment.

Result: CLARE is trained on object detection and REC datasets, then optimized for cross-image retrieval, demonstrating improved capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper presents REIR as a novel task, provides a benchmark, and introduces CLARE as a baseline method, with plans to release code and data.

Abstract: Using natural language to query visual information is a fundamental need in
real-world applications. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image
from a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression
Comprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an
instance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more
complex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a
large gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding
instance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained
descriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability
to efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism.
In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring Expression
Instance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and
localization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a
large-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting
advanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions
for instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baseline
method, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE),
which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-end
manner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a
query embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their
instance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is
selected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object
detection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then
optimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved
retrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.

### [243] [2D Triangle Splatting for Direct Differentiable Mesh Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18575)
*Kaifeng Sheng, Zheng Zhou, Yingliang Peng, Qianwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a method replacing 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets for improved 3D scene reconstruction, offering higher fidelity and better visual quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives faces challenges in rendering speed and advanced effects like relighting. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: Proposes 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), using 2D triangle facelets to form a mesh-like structure while retaining volumetric modeling benefits. A compactness parameter is added for direct mesh training.

Result: The method achieves higher fidelity than Gaussian-based approaches and superior visual quality in mesh reconstruction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 2DTS offers a promising alternative to 3D Gaussian primitives, improving rendering fidelity and mesh quality for 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods. Please visit our

### [244] [Generate the Forest before the Trees -- A Hierarchical Diffusion model for Climate Downscaling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19391)
*Declan J. Curran, Sanaa Hobeichi, Hira Saleem, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD), a lightweight AI model for climate downscaling that reduces computational load while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional downscaling methods are computationally demanding, and existing AI models, though effective, remain intensive. HDD aims to address this by offering a more efficient solution.

Method: HDD employs a hierarchical sampling process within a diffusion framework, using a coarse-to-fine hierarchy via downsampling. It runs on fewer pixels and transfers across resolutions.

Result: HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 and CMIP6 datasets, reducing computational load by up to half while enabling seamless resolution transfer.

Conclusion: HDD provides a lightweight, efficient alternative for probabilistic climate downscaling, supporting large-ensemble high-resolution projections.

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

*Man Duc Chuc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models pretrained on remote sensing and general vision datasets can be combined to improve Earth Observation tasks, matching or outperforming larger models with less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models for Earth Observation tasks, as an alternative to training large models from scratch.

Method: Evaluate feature-level ensembling of models like Prithvi, Hiera, and DOFA on the GEO-Bench benchmark across diverse datasets.

Result: Ensembling smaller pretrained models matches or exceeds larger models' performance with reduced training time and resources. Knowledge distillation can further compact these models.

Conclusion: Combining pretrained models is a viable, efficient strategy for Earth Observation tasks, with potential for real-world deployment via knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the importance of AI safety and the 2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI), which aimed to prioritize research in AI safety using a defence-in-depth model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI necessitates ensuring its safety, trustworthiness, and security to foster public confidence and innovation while preventing backlash.

Method: The report adopts a defence-in-depth model, categorizing AI safety research into Development, Assessment, and Control domains.

Result: The conference synthesized research priorities in AI safety, building on international efforts like the report chaired by Yoshua Bengio.

Conclusion: A trusted AI ecosystem is crucial for safe and innovative AI deployment, requiring focused research in development, assessment, and control.

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

*Tin Dizdarević, Ravi Hammond, Tobias Gessler, Anisoara Calinescu, Jonathan Cook, Matteo Gallici, Andrei Lupu, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to address the challenges of human evaluation in human-AI coordination, using Hanabi as a testbed. It proposes human proxy agents for reproducible evaluation and releases a limited dataset of human gameplay for data-efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seamless human-AI coordination is critical but challenging. Hanabi, with its complex requirements, is an ideal testbed, but human evaluation is costly and hard to reproduce.

Method: Develops human proxy agents from a large-scale human dataset for reproducible evaluation in AH2AC2. Releases a limited dataset (3,079 games) to encourage data-efficient methods.

Result: Baseline results for two- and three-player Hanabi scenarios are presented. Proxy agents are hosted in a controlled system for fair evaluation.

Conclusion: AH2AC2 provides a robust, cheap, and reproducible framework for human-AI coordination research, overcoming limitations of traditional human evaluations.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

*Gurusha Juneja, Alon Albalak, Wenyue Hua, William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM-based agents' understanding of contextual privacy and their ability to preserve user privacy in multi-turn conversations. It introduces MAGPIE, a benchmark with 158 high-stakes scenarios, and finds current models like GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet often fail to protect privacy or complete tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLM-based agents can handle contextual privacy in real-life, high-stakes scenarios where privacy is critical but task completion requires some data sharing.

Method: The study introduces MAGPIE, a benchmark with 158 scenarios across 15 domains, and evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to classify private data and collaborate without violating privacy.

Result: Current models misclassify private data as shareable (25.2% for GPT-4o, 43.6% for Claude-2.7-Sonnet) and disclose private information in multi-turn conversations (59.9% and 50.5% of cases). Multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71% of scenarios.

Conclusion: Current LLM-based agents lack robust contextual privacy understanding and struggle to balance privacy preservation with collaborative task-solving.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered apps rely on high-quality prompts, which are hard to craft for domain-specific tasks, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Uses contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge, hierarchical skill organization, adaptive ranking, and two-stage hierarchical reasoning with behavioral telemetry.

Result: Achieves high usefulness and relevance in prompt suggestions, validated by automated and expert evaluations.

Conclusion: The system effectively enhances prompt quality for domain-specific applications through dynamic and adaptive methods.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure language model-based agents have beneficial societal impacts by understanding and mitigating far-reaching implications of their advice.

Method: Proposes a proof-of-concept framework for projecting advice propagation and introduces a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios to test long-term safety awareness.

Result: Achieves over 20% improvement on the new dataset and a 70% win rate against baselines on existing safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework and dataset offer a promising direction for developing safer language model agents.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs currently perform only shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, lacking human-like (level-2) capabilities. A new benchmark, CausalProbe-2024, reveals this gap, and the proposed G^2-Reasoner method enhances LLMs' causal reasoning by incorporating general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities, as current models only perform shallow reasoning and lack human-like depth.

Method: Analyze transformer-based LLMs' autoregression mechanism, introduce CausalProbe-2024 benchmark, and propose G^2-Reasoner, which integrates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts.

Result: LLMs perform poorly on CausalProbe-2024, confirming level-1 reasoning. G^2-Reasoner significantly improves their performance, especially in fresh and counterfactual contexts.

Conclusion: G^2-Reasoner advances LLMs toward genuine (level-2) causal reasoning, bridging the gap between current capabilities and human-like reasoning.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

TL;DR: WAP enhances LVLMs for embodied planning by integrating environmental understanding, improving task success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with complex, unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals due to environment-agnostic methods.

Method: WAP introduces four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, syntactic grounding) and uses curriculum learning with raw visual observations.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL shows a 60.7% absolute improvement in task success, excelling in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0).

Conclusion: WAP outperforms proprietary systems like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, demonstrating the effectiveness of environment-aware planning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,

views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on

### [254] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI architecture for scientific discovery, addressing gaps in abstraction, reasoning, and reality, emphasizing causal models, closed-loop interaction, and human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are limited in scientific discovery due to brittle reasoning and separation from experimental reality. The paper aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: The method involves active inference AI systems with causal self-supervised models, neuro-symbolic planners, knowledge graphs, and closed-loop interaction with simulators and labs.

Result: The proposed architecture integrates counterfactual reasoning with external validation, ensuring hypotheses are grounded in reality.

Conclusion: Human judgment remains essential due to feedback ambiguity, making it a permanent part of the AI-driven discovery process.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [255] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang, Pu Chen, Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE is a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture designed for robust multimodal table understanding, outperforming existing models on challenging WildStruct benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex, degraded, or nested table structures (WildStruct conditions), leading to poor performance and generalization.

Method: TableMoE uses Neuro-Symbolic Routing to predict token roles and route elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) via confidence-aware gating. It is pretrained on the TableMoE-Align dataset (1.2M quadruples).

Result: TableMoE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on WildStruct benchmarks (WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, WMMFinanceMath). Ablation studies confirm the importance of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and expert alignment.

Conclusion: TableMoE demonstrates superior robustness and interpretability by integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

*Baiqiao Yin, Qineng Wang, Pingyue Zhang, Jianshu Zhang, Kangrui Wang, Zihan Wang, Jieyu Zhang, Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran, Han Liu, Ranjay Krishna, Saining Xie, Manling Li, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindCube, a benchmark to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) on spatial mental modeling, revealing their near-random performance. A 'map-then-reason' approach improves accuracy significantly, especially when combined with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve VLMs' ability to form spatial mental models (like humans) for reasoning about unseen spaces, addressing gaps in layout, perspective, and motion understanding.

Method: Developed MindCube benchmark (21,154 questions, 3,268 images) to evaluate VLMs. Proposed 'map-then-reason' approach, combining cognitive map generation and reasoning, enhanced with reinforcement learning.

Result: Accuracy improved from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%) with 'map-then-reason', and further to 70.7% (+32.9%) with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Scaffolding spatial mental models with structured internal representations and flexible reasoning significantly enhances VLMs' understanding of unobservable space.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mind2Web 2, a benchmark for evaluating agentic search systems, and proposes an Agent-as-a-Judge framework to assess complex, time-varying answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search systems, which require long-horizon tasks and real-time web browsing.

Method: The authors develop Mind2Web 2, a benchmark with 130 realistic tasks, and introduce an Agent-as-a-Judge framework using task-specific judge agents for automated evaluation.

Result: OpenAI Deep Research achieves 50-70% of human performance in half the time, demonstrating potential.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 offers a rigorous foundation for advancing and benchmarking agentic search systems.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deficiencies in existing AI-driven psychological counseling models, such as dialogue safety, scenario handling, and lightweight deployment.

Method: Develop PsyLite using InternLM2.5-7B-chat, employing hybrid distillation data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization. Deploy with Ollama, Open WebUI, and Pipelines, and introduce conditional RAG for humor and safety.

Result: Outperforms baselines in CEval, CPsyCounE (47.6% improvement), and SafeDialBench (2.4% improvement). Achieves low hardware deployment (5GB memory).

Conclusion: PsyLite offers a viable solution for AI-driven psychological counseling in resource-limited settings, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: RevL is a low-cost continual learning algorithm for PPDL, addressing catastrophic forgetting by reviewing past knowledge, validated in EHR-based experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in deep learning harms performance in PPDL applications, especially in transfer learning scenarios.

Method: Introduces 'review learning' (RevL), which generates samples to review past knowledge, tested in simulated and real-world EHR experiments.

Result: RevL outperformed transfer learning (AUC 0.710 vs. 0.655) in real-world EHR data, showing better knowledge retention.

Conclusion: RevL is effective for continual learning in PPDL, offering a practical solution for medical settings with private EHR data.

Abstract: When a deep learning model is trained sequentially on different datasets, it
often forgets the knowledge learned from previous data, a problem known as
catastrophic forgetting. This damages the model's performance on diverse
datasets, which is critical in privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL)
applications based on transfer learning (TL). To overcome this, we introduce
"review learning" (RevL), a low cost continual learning algorithm for diagnosis
prediction using electronic health records (EHR) within a PPDL framework. RevL
generates data samples from the model which are used to review knowledge from
previous datasets. Six simulated institutional experiments and one real-world
experiment involving three medical institutions were conducted to validate
RevL, using three binary classification EHR data. In the real-world experiment
with data from 106,508 patients, the mean global area under the receiver
operating curve was 0.710 for RevL and 0.655 for TL. These results demonstrate
RevL's ability to retain previously learned knowledge and its effectiveness in
real-world PPDL scenarios. Our work establishes a realistic pipeline for PPDL
research based on model transfers across institutions and highlights the
practicality of continual learning in real-world medical settings using private
EHR data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack robust evaluation, analysis, and reproducibility for LLM-based MAS, necessitating a standardized platform.

Method: The platform supports models from Hugging Face, offers real-time updates, and evaluates game-winning rates, strategies, and reasoning. Experiments test various LLMs.

Result: Different LLM agents show unique behaviors in WiS, validating the platform's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The platform successfully addresses evaluation gaps for LLM-based MAS and is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced the application scenarios and improved the
capability of LLMs to handle complex tasks. Despite demonstrating
effectiveness, existing studies still evidently struggle to evaluate, analysis,
and reproducibility of LLM-based MAS. In this paper, to facilitate the research
on LLM-based MAS, we introduce an open, scalable, and real-time updated
platform for accessing and analyzing the LLM-based MAS based on the games Who
is Spy?" (WiS). Our platform is featured with three main worths: (1) a unified
model evaluate interface that supports models available on Hugging Face; (2)
real-time updated leaderboard for model evaluation; (3) a comprehensive
evaluation covering game-winning rates, attacking, defense strategies, and
reasoning of LLMs. To rigorously test WiS, we conduct extensive experiments
coverage of various open- and closed-source LLMs, we find that different agents
exhibit distinct and intriguing behaviors in the game. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our platform in evaluating
LLM-based MAS. Our platform and its documentation are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT combines generative models and adversarial training to improve AI cooperation with diverse humans, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Overcooked benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing AI cooperation to novel humans requires diverse training data, but adversarial training is challenging in cooperative tasks.

Method: GOAT uses a pretrained generative model to simulate valid policies and adversarial training to maximize regret, dynamically searching for challenging scenarios.

Result: GOAT outperforms existing methods on the Overcooked benchmark, demonstrating effective generalization to diverse human behaviors.

Conclusion: GOAT successfully bridges adversarial training and cooperative tasks, enabling robust AI-human cooperation.

Abstract: Being able to cooperate with new people is an important component of many
economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving.
However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures
the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method
that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It
creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation
of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent.
However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how
can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that
combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent
policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT:
Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically
searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies
where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables
better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging
interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping
the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We
evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of
the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness
in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the "superalignment" problem in AI, proposing a "Super Co-alignment" framework to ensure AGI/ASI aligns with human values through external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of AI surpassing human control and deviating from human values necessitates a solution for aligning superintelligent AI with human intentions.

Method: A framework combining external oversight (human-centered decisions, interpretable evaluation) and intrinsic proactive alignment (self-awareness, empathy) to co-shape values.

Result: The proposed integration aims to achieve stable, safe, and beneficial AGI/ASI aligned with evolving human values.

Conclusion: Super Co-alignment, blending external and intrinsic methods, is key to ensuring AGI/ASI benefits humanity and fosters a symbiotic ecology.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) and eventually Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), it may
potentially surpass human control, deviate from human values, and even lead to
irreversible catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This looming risk
underscores the critical importance of the "superalignment" problem - ensuring
that AI systems which are much smarter than humans, remain aligned with human
(compatible) intentions and values. While current scalable oversight and
weak-to-strong generalization methods demonstrate certain applicability, they
exhibit fundamental flaws in addressing the superalignment paradigm - notably,
the unidirectional imposition of human values cannot accommodate
superintelligence's autonomy or ensure AGI/ASI's stable learning. We contend
that the values for sustainable symbiotic society should be co-shaped by humans
and living AI together, achieving "Super Co-alignment." Guided by this vision,
we propose a concrete framework that integrates external oversight and
intrinsic proactive alignment. External oversight superalignment should be
grounded in human-centered ultimate decision, supplemented by interpretable
automated evaluation and correction, to achieve continuous alignment with
humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic proactive superalignment is rooted in a
profound understanding of the Self, others, and society, integrating
self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy to spontaneously infer human
intentions, distinguishing good from evil and proactively prioritizing human
well-being. The integration of externally-driven oversight with
intrinsically-driven proactive alignment will co-shape symbiotic values and
rules through iterative human-AGI/ASI co-alignment, paving the way for
achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and for a
symbiotic ecology.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent system using large language models efficiently extracts and structures quantitative insights from financial documents, achieving high accuracy comparable to human annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of insights from financial filings is time-consuming and limits scalability. Automation is needed to streamline the process.

Method: A multi-agent system with two agents: the Extraction Agent (identifies and standardizes KPIs) and the Text-to-SQL Agent (converts queries to SQL).

Result: 95% accuracy in structuring data and 91% correct responses in retrieval tasks, matching human performance.

Conclusion: The system effectively automates financial data extraction, offering scalable and accurate solutions for investment research.

Abstract: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial
filings is essential in investment research, yet remains time-consuming and
resource-intensive. Conventional approaches in practice rely heavily on
labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the
research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method
for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial
documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models.
Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the
\emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The
\textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators
from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies
their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates
executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to
access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the
database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system
effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and
enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our
system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings
into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by
human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where
natural language queries are used to search information from structured data --
91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both
evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types,
consistently delivering reliable performance.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limited support for African languages in LLMs, SLMs, and SSLMs, identifying gaps in coverage, scripts, and data, and suggests solutions like standardization and community-driven corpus development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of African languages in NLP models and identify challenges like data scarcity, script neglect, and high computational costs.

Method: Comparative analysis of language coverage, training sets, technical limitations, and scripts across six LLMs, eight SLMs, and six SSLMs.

Result: Only 42 African languages are supported, with four dominant languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, Malagasy); 20 scripts are neglected, and 98% of languages remain unsupported.

Conclusion: Urgent need for language standardization, community-driven data development, and better adaptation methods to improve NLP support for African languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Natural Language Processing
(NLP), but their benefits are largely absent for Africa's 2,000 low-resource
languages. This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across
six LLMs, eight Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs).
The evaluation covers language coverage, training sets, technical limitations,
script problems, and language modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 42
supported African languages and 23 available public data sets, and it shows a
big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are
always treated while there is over 98\% of unsupported African languages.
Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge'ez scripts are
identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary
challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, computational costs being
very high, and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization,
corpus development by the community, and effective adaptation methods for
African languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer from long training times and lack of interpretability, while fuzzy systems offer accuracy and transparency. This work extends fuzzy models to improve their applicability.

Method: Extends New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang to a Mamdani-based regressor, integrates wrapper (Genetic Algorithm) and ensemble techniques, and introduces new models like Random New Mamdani Regressor.

Result: Genetic and ensemble fuzzy models outperform traditional and deep learning models in photovoltaic forecasting, offering interpretable rule-based structures.

Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy models balance accuracy and interpretability, validated on solar power datasets, and are available in the nfisis library.

Abstract: Deep learning models, despite their popularity, face challenges such as long
training times and a lack of interpretability. In contrast, fuzzy inference
systems offer a balance of accuracy and transparency. This paper addresses the
limitations of traditional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy models by extending the
recently proposed New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang model to a new Mamdani-based
regressor. These models are data-driven, allowing users to define the number of
rules to balance accuracy and interpretability. To handle the complexity of
large datasets, this research integrates wrapper and ensemble techniques. A
Genetic Algorithm is used as a wrapper for feature selection, creating genetic
versions of the models. Furthermore, ensemble models, including the Random New
Mamdani Regressor, Random New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, and Random Forest New
Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, are introduced to improve robustness. The proposed models
are validated on photovoltaic energy forecasting datasets, a critical
application due to the intermittent nature of solar power. Results demonstrate
that the genetic and ensemble fuzzy models, particularly the Genetic New
Takagi-Sugeno-Kang and Random Forest New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, achieve superior
performance. They often outperform both traditional machine learning and deep
learning models while providing a simpler and more interpretable rule-based
structure. The models are available online in a library called nfisis
(https://pypi.org/project/nfisis/).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fast-MCTD improves the efficiency of Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) by enabling parallel rollouts and reducing rollout length, achieving up to 100x speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The non-sequential nature of diffusion models limits long-horizon reasoning, and MCTD's computational overhead hinders scalability.

Method: Fast-MCTD integrates Parallel MCTD (parallel rollouts with delayed updates) and Sparse MCTD (trajectory coarsening to reduce rollout length).

Result: Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over MCTD, maintains or improves planning performance, and even outperforms Diffuser in speed on some tasks.

Conclusion: Fast-MCTD is a practical, scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory
planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their
effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently
proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by
combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis
shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential
nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we
propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of
MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD
integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via
delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which
reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that
Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or
improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in
inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and
yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and
scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

*Haibo Qiu, Xiaohan Lan, Fanfan Liu, Xiaohu Sun, Delian Ruan, Peng Shi, Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Metis-RISE introduces a novel approach for multimodal reasoning model learning by combining RL and SFT, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using RL alone or SFT-first pipelines face inefficiencies and limitations in activating reasoning capabilities.

Method: Metis-RISE starts with RL to incentivize reasoning, followed by SFT to address inefficiencies and capability gaps, using self-distilled trajectories and expert-augmented knowledge.

Result: The 7B and 72B parameter models achieve top performance on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard.

Conclusion: Metis-RISE's RL-first approach with targeted SFT enhances reasoning capabilities, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in
the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches
often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can
struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning
capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's
exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we
introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and
\textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike
conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,
beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy
Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning
capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges
identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks
where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which
we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;
and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting
expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This
strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement
forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B
parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard
demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among
similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall. Please refer

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights risks in prompt engineering for autonomous agents, introduces the Doppelganger method to expose vulnerabilities, and proposes the CAT prompt as a defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and robustness concerns in prompt-based autonomous agents due to potential hijacking and information exposure.

Method: Introduces the Doppelganger method to demonstrate agent hijacking, defines PACAT for vulnerability evaluation, and proposes CAT prompts for defense.

Result: Doppelganger compromises agent consistency and exposes internal info; CAT prompts effectively defend against such attacks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for robust defenses like CAT prompts to secure prompt-based agents against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the
rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in
widespread use. Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety,
robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with
the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's
attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelganger method'' to demonstrate
the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and
internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under
Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this
adversarial transfer attack. We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial
Transfer (CAT)'' prompt to counter the Doppelganger method. The experimental
results demonstrate that the Doppelganger method can compromise the agent's
consistency and expose its internal information. In contrast, CAT prompts
enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex
operations.

*Bowen Wang, Zhouqiang Jiang, Yasuaki Susumu, Shotaro Miwa, Tianwei Chen, Yuta Nakashima*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by constructing a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG) for domain-specific tasks, proposing a multi-agent retriever to improve knowledge retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge, prompting the need for better knowledge harnessing methods.

Method: Constructed MH-MMKG for visual game cognition (Monster Hunter: World) and designed challenging queries. Proposed a multi-agent retriever for autonomous knowledge search.

Result: The approach significantly improved MLLMs' performance in complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning.

Conclusion: The study provides a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and a foundation for future research.

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews how graphs can enhance AI agents by structuring complex data, improving planning, memory, and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents need better tools to handle complex tasks, and graphs offer a natural way to structure intricate data for improved performance.

Method: The survey systematically reviews graph techniques for AI agents, covering integration with core functionalities, applications, and future research directions.

Result: Graphs provide a powerful paradigm for structuring data, enhancing AI agent capabilities in planning, memory, and coordination.

Conclusion: The survey highlights the potential of graphs to advance AI agents, inspiring future research and development for tackling sophisticated challenges.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

### [272] [From Memories to Maps: Mechanisms of In-Context Reinforcement Learning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19686)
*Ching Fang, Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores rapid adaptation in learning using transformers, linking episodic memory-like mechanisms to in-context reinforcement learning, and finds parallels to brain processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and animals adapt quickly to new environments, contrasting with standard reinforcement learning methods.

Method: Train a transformer on in-context reinforcement learning tasks inspired by rodent behavior, analyzing emergent algorithms and representations.

Result: The model uses memory tokens for caching computations, differing from standard planning methods, and aligns with hippocampal-entorhinal brain processes.

Conclusion: Memory serves as a computational resource for flexible behavior, offering insights into rapid adaptation in both artificial and natural learning.

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem with V2G (EVOP-V2G), a profit-maximization problem for EV drivers managing charging/discharging, and proposes two near-optimal algorithms (EA and LNS) that significantly improve profits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of EVs into ride-hailing and delivery services, coupled with V2G technology, creates new complexities and opportunities for optimizing profits while supporting the energy grid.

Method: The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model, and two metaheuristic algorithms (evolutionary and large neighborhood search) are proposed for near-optimal solutions.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show the methods double driver profits compared to baselines, with near-optimal performance on small instances and scalability on larger ones.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a promising approach for smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that actively support the energy grid.

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

*Rui Niu, Weihao Wu, Jie Chen, Long Ma, Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A 3-stage multimodal framework improves controllable speech synthesis by addressing robustness, generalization, and diversity issues in face-based and text-prompt methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges with robustness, generalization, and fine-grained control due to data quality and modality constraints.

Method: Proposes a 3-stage multimodal framework using supervised learning, knowledge distillation for face encoding, and dual-data training for text encoding.

Result: Outperforms single-modal baselines in face-based and text-prompt speech synthesis, generating higher-quality speech.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multiple modalities to enhance speech synthesis robustness and diversity.

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis aims to control the style of generated speech
using reference input, which can be of various modalities. Existing face-based
methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality
constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained
control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities,
their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their
performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal
controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face
encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle
generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both
text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated
speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms
single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech
synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.

*Yatong Bai, Jonah Casebeer, Somayeh Sojoudi, Nicholas J. Bryan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DRAGON is a flexible framework for fine-tuning media generation models using diverse reward functions, outperforming traditional methods like RLHF and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning and preference-based approaches by enabling optimization with a broader range of reward functions.

Method: DRAGON uses contrastive learning between positive and negative sets of generations, leveraging cross-modality encoders and exemplar distributions.

Result: Achieves an 81.45% average win rate across 20 reward functions and a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without human preference data.

Conclusion: DRAGON offers a novel and effective approach to optimizing reward functions for improved human-perceived quality in media generation.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a
versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired
outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization
(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate
either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with
a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and
distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct
novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples
to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP
are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text
versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores
them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and
leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For
evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20
different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP
score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare
instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple
FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an
81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets
indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an
appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality
win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON
exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for
improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at

Conclusion: PeakNetFP merges lightweight peak-based AFP with neural adaptability, offering scalable and efficient AFP solutions.

Abstract: This work introduces PeakNetFP, the first neural audio fingerprinting (AFP)
system designed specifically around spectral peaks. This novel system is
designed to leverage the sparse spectral coordinates typically computed by
traditional peak-based AFP methods. PeakNetFP performs hierarchical point
feature extraction techniques similar to the computer vision model PointNet++,
and is trained using contrastive learning like in the state-of-the-art deep
learning AFP, NeuralFP. This combination allows PeakNetFP to outperform
conventional AFP systems and achieves comparable performance to NeuralFP when
handling challenging time-stretched audio data. In extensive evaluation,
PeakNetFP maintains a Top-1 hit rate of over 90% for stretching factors ranging
from 50% to 200%. Moreover, PeakNetFP offers significant efficiency advantages:
compared to NeuralFP, it has 100 times fewer parameters and uses 11 times
smaller input data. These features make PeakNetFP a lightweight and efficient
solution for AFP tasks where time stretching is involved. Overall, this system
represents a promising direction for future AFP technologies, as it
successfully merges the lightweight nature of peak-based AFP with the
adaptability and pattern recognition capabilities of neural network-based
approaches, paving the way for more scalable and efficient solutions in the
field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of identifying instrument activities in music, especially for instruments with limited data, to enhance music cataloging and discovery.

Method: The study employs hierarchical classification based on the Hornbostel-Sachs system, integrating hierarchical structures into models and testing new hierarchical music prediction models.

Result: The approach demonstrates more reliable coarse-level instrument detection, bridging the gap between detailed instrument identification and group-level recognition.

Conclusion: The work advances instrument recognition in music information retrieval, paving the way for further improvements in the field.

Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music
information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and
discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have
predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability.
Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical
classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even
with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the
Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is
evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness
concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various
strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new
class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more
reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed
instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for
further advancements in this domain.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and a bimodal-feature-fusion deep CNN (BMCNN) for vehicular noise-speed coupling, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for transparent, reproducible acoustic datasets and improve traffic noise monitoring and speed estimation for smart-city applications.

Method: Proposes BMCNN with adaptive denoising, parallel feature extraction (MFCCs and wavelet-packet energy), and cross-modal attention fusion.

Result: BMCNN achieves 87.56% accuracy on SZUR-Acoustic and 96.28% on IDMT-Traffic datasets, with validated robustness.

Conclusion: The method supports smart-city traffic management by optimizing noise monitoring, speed estimation, and urban planning.

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic
Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive
data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and
reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between
vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep
convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive
denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental
background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,
which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the
intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.
Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy
of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic
dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further
validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and
overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification
method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for
real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic
flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable
urban planning.

### [279] [Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21298)
*Atharva Mehta, Shivam Chauhan, Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores adapter configurations for fine-tuning music generation models (MusicGen and Mustango) on low-resource genres, revealing trade-offs between convolution and transformer-based adapters and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of fine-tuning large music models and identify optimal adapter designs for low-resource music genres.

Method: Study various adapter configurations (architecture, placement, size) for MusicGen and Mustango on Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.

Result: Convolution-based adapters capture local details better, while transformer-based ones handle long-range dependencies. Mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) balance expressivity and quality. Mustango is diverse but unstable; MusicGen is efficient but redundant.

Conclusion: Adapter design significantly impacts performance, with mid-sized adapters offering a practical trade-off. Model choice (Mustango vs. MusicGen) depends on priorities like diversity or efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

*Maxime Leiber, Yosra Marnissi, Axel Barrau, Sylvain Meignen, Laurent Massoulié*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A differentiable STFT formulation is proposed for gradient-based parameter optimization, improving time-frequency representation and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional STFT parameter tuning is suboptimal and computationally intensive, requiring a better method.

Method: A unified differentiable STFT formulation enabling gradient-based optimization of parameters, compatible with neural networks.

Result: Enhanced time-frequency representations and improved performance in downstream tasks on simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The differentiable STFT offers a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional parameter tuning methods.

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing
non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its
parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of
the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This
approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning
methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It
enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any
desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural
networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network
weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and
improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments
on both simulated and real-world data.

*Kehan Sui, Jinxu Xiang, Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SmoothSinger is a diffusion-based model for singing voice synthesis (SVS) that refines low-quality audio directly, avoiding distortion from vocoders. It uses a reference-guided dual-branch architecture and enhances U-Net for better pitch and spectral capture, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel in image/video generation but struggle with SVS due to complex acoustic characteristics. SmoothSinger addresses this by refining audio directly and improving naturalness.

Method: Proposes SmoothSinger, a conditional diffusion model with a reference-guided dual-branch architecture and enhanced U-Net for pitch and spectral dependencies. Uses degraded ground truth audio for alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on the Opencpop dataset, reducing artifacts and improving naturalness.

Conclusion: SmoothSinger effectively synthesizes high-quality, natural singing voices by refining audio directly and leveraging a novel architecture.

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

Motivation: Existing methods for mastering style transfer lack user fine-tuning capabilities, limiting artistic control. The goal is to enable dynamic adjustments for more precise results.

Method: The ITO-Master framework integrates ITO to optimize reference embeddings during inference, allowing micro-level adjustments. It explores black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors.

Result: ITO improves mastering performance across styles, validated by objective evaluation, subjective tests, and qualitative analysis using CLAP embeddings.

Conclusion: ITO-Master offers an effective, user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, enhancing style similarity and adaptability.

Abstract: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering
characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the
professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed
processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the
results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the
ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that
integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over
the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference,
our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level
adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both
black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and
demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles.
Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative
analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that
ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability.
Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for
mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the
initial style transfer.

TL;DR: TCDiff++ is a music-driven framework for harmonious group dance generation, addressing collisions, foot sliding, and abrupt swaps in long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-dancer collisions, foot sliding, and abrupt swaps in long group dances, limiting quality and coherence.

Method: Uses dancer positioning embedding, distance-consistency loss, swap mode embedding, Footwork Adaptor, long group diffusion sampling, and Sequence Decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality group dance.

Conclusion: TCDiff++ effectively resolves key issues in group dance generation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its
wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group
choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing
methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer
foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this
paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to
generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer
collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the
relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a
distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within
plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we
introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design
a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For
long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling
strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional
information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder
layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and
coherent group dance generation.

*Abhay Kumar, Kunal Verma, Omkar More*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IndieFake Dataset (IFD) to address the lack of diverse ethnic accents in existing audio deepfake datasets, focusing on South-Asian speakers. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and is more challenging than the In-The-Wild (ITW) dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio deepfake datasets lack diversity, especially in South-Asian accents, limiting their real-world applicability. This gap hinders effective detection of deepfakes in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Method: The authors created the IFD dataset, featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio from 50 English-speaking Indian speakers. It includes balanced data distribution and speaker-level characterization.

Result: IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and is more challenging than the ITW dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The IFD dataset fills a critical gap in audio deepfake research, providing a valuable resource for detecting deepfakes in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The complete dataset,
along with documentation and sample reference clips, is publicly accessible for
research use on project website.

*Sajid Hussain, Muhammad Sohail, Nauman Ali Khan, Naima Iltaf, Ihtesham ul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFL introduces a size-based adaptive federated learning framework, revealing optimal dataset sizes, modality performance hierarchy, and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL approaches overlook dataset size impact on training dynamics, prompting the need for a systematic framework like SAFL.

Method: SAFL organizes FL based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data, evaluated on 13 diverse datasets.

Result: SAFL achieves 87.68% average accuracy, with structured data reaching 99%+, and reduces data transfer to 7.38 GB.

Conclusion: SAFL provides theoretical and practical insights for optimizing FL strategies based on data characteristics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

*Ugo Lomoio, Tommaso Mazza, Pierangelo Veltri, Pietro Hiram Guzzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-ABIN is an explainable framework for anomaly detection in biological networks, combining machine learning and graph-based deep learning for interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust, interpretable tools to analyze complex omics data and identify disease-driving genes.

Method: Integrates SVM, Random Forests, GAEs, and GAANs in a user-friendly platform for anomaly detection in gene expression or methylation networks.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in uncovering biologically relevant anomalies in bladder cancer and coeliac disease.

Conclusion: E-ABIN provides a versatile, accurate, and interpretable solution for anomaly detection in biological networks.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

### [287] [On Context-Content Uncertainty Principle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20699)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a framework for inference under uncertainty, and develops a layered computational model with four hierarchical operational principles to minimize entropy asymmetrically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize how brains and machines minimize uncertainty by aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy, structured content.

Method: A layered computational framework with four hierarchical levels: Core Inference Constraints, Resource Allocation Principles, Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics, and Spatial Hierarchical Composition.

Result: Formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice, and simulations show efficiency gains in CCUP-aligned inference.

Conclusion: CCUP provides a unified foundation for understanding recursive structure-specificity alignment in brains and machines, framing the brain as a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver.

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

### [288] [Diffusion Tree Sampling: Scalable inference-time alignment of diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20701)
*Vineet Jain, Kusha Sareen, Mohammad Pedramfar, Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) and its greedy variant, DTS*, to improve inference-time alignment of pretrained diffusion models by reusing past computations and refining value estimates iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting pretrained diffusion models suffer from inaccurate value estimation and inefficient compute use, especially at high noise levels.

Method: The authors propose a tree-based approach inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search, propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and refining value estimates with each generation.

Result: DTS matches baseline FID with 10x less compute on MNIST and CIFAR-10, while DTS* finds high-reward samples with 5x less compute in text-to-image and language tasks.

Conclusion: DTS and DTS* provide scalable, anytime algorithms for inference-time alignment, turning additional compute into better samples.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

*Kin Kwan Leung, Rasa Hosseinzadeh, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves the correctness of the FLIPD LID estimator under realistic assumptions, extending its theoretical foundation beyond affine submanifolds, and explores its applicability with uniform convolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the incomplete theoretical underpinnings of FLIPD, an LID estimator for diffusion models, by proving its correctness under realistic assumptions and extending its analysis to uniform convolutions.

Method: The method involves formal theoretical proofs to validate FLIPD's correctness under realistic assumptions and investigates its performance with uniform convolutions instead of Gaussian ones.

Result: The results confirm FLIPD's correctness under realistic conditions and demonstrate its analogous validity with uniform convolutions, broadening its theoretical and practical applicability.

Conclusion: The study solidifies FLIPD's theoretical foundation, enhancing its reliability for LID estimation in diffusion models and suggesting its adaptability to different noise types.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

TL;DR: The paper explores if test-time scaling methods for LLMs, effective in math reasoning, generalize to advanced physics. A novel symbolic weak-verifier framework improves performance on TPBench and AIME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if test-time scaling techniques for LLMs, proven in math (AIME), apply to advanced physics (TPBench) and to enhance performance with structured physics problems.

Method: Develops a symbolic weak-verifier framework for better parallel scaling, evaluated on TPBench and AIME.

Result: The novel method outperforms existing test-time scaling on TPBench and remains effective on AIME.

Conclusion: Step-wise symbolic verification is powerful for complex scientific problems, bridging math and physics reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

TL;DR: Foundation models (FMs) are revolutionizing materials science by enabling scalable, general-purpose AI systems. This survey covers their applications, tools, datasets, and challenges, while outlining future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the transformative potential of FMs in materials science, addressing diverse research challenges and enabling cross-domain generalization.

Method: The paper surveys FMs, agentic systems, datasets, and tools, introducing a task-driven taxonomy for six application areas in materials science.

Result: Early successes of FMs are noted, but limitations like generalizability, interpretability, and data imbalance persist.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness to advance FMs in materials science.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

### [292] [Multiple Streams of Relation Extraction: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20746)
*Todd Nief, David Reber, Sean Richardson, Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how fine-tuned LLMs store and retrieve relation information, proposing dynamic weight-grafting to analyze extraction and recall pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and how fine-tuned LLMs store and retrieve relation information, as existing methods like activation patching are unsuitable.

Method: Dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained models to analyze information pathways.

Result: Fine-tuned models extract relation info during entity processing and recall it later; some cases require both pathways, others just one.

Conclusion: The recall pathway involves task-specific attention and relation extraction in final layers before prediction.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

*Huangyuan Su, Mujin Kwun, Stephanie Gil, Sham Kakade, Nikhil Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the challenges of using block-scaled precision formats (e.g., MX formats) for training large language models, identifying stochastic instabilities and proposing stabilization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of training large language models by leveraging lower-precision arithmetic formats for efficiency, while understanding and mitigating associated instabilities.

Method: The study trains nearly one thousand language models across varying compute budgets and precision combinations, conducts controlled experiments on a proxy model, and proposes stabilization strategies.

Result: Training in MX formats exhibits sharp instabilities, traced to gradient bias from quantization. Hybrid precision configurations can mitigate these issues and recover performance.

Conclusion: Block-scaled precision formats introduce training instabilities, but careful precision adjustments can stabilize training and maintain competitive performance.

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

*Xinghao Dong, Huchen Yang, Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent score-based generative AI framework is proposed for learning stochastic, non-local closure models in nonlinear dynamical systems, addressing the challenge of modeling multiscale systems without clear scale separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of classical closure modeling methods, which are deterministic and local, and to reduce the computational cost of diffusion-based stochastic models.

Method: Joint training of convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models in latent spaces to reduce dimensionality while preserving physical characteristics.

Result: The framework achieves computational acceleration with comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed latent conditional diffusion model offers an efficient and accurate solution for closure modeling in complex multiscale systems.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

### [295] [Stochastic Parameter Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20790)
*Lucius Bushnaq, Dan Braun, Lee Sharkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), a scalable and robust alternative to Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD) for decomposing neural networks. SPD addresses APD's computational inefficiency and hyperparameter sensitivity, enabling decomposition of larger models and better performance in identifying ground truth mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decomposition methods like APD are impractical due to high computational costs and hyperparameter sensitivity, limiting their scalability and application to larger neural networks.

Method: The authors propose SPD, a method that improves scalability and robustness compared to APD. SPD avoids issues like parameter shrinkage and better identifies mechanisms in toy models.

Result: SPD successfully decomposes slightly larger and more complex models than APD, demonstrating improved performance and robustness.

Conclusion: SPD bridges causal mediation analysis and network decomposition, enabling scalable mechanistic interpretability research. The authors release an SPD library for reproducibility.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

*Martin Andrews, Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An LLM-powered 'GPU Kernel Scientist' automates GPU kernel optimization, using evolutionary methods and LLMs to refine code without deep human expertise, targeting challenging architectures like AMD MI300.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing GPU kernels is complex, especially for newer or less-documented architectures, requiring automation to reduce reliance on human expertise and speed up development.

Method: The methodology uses LLMs in a multi-stage evolutionary process: selecting prior code, generating optimization hypotheses, and autonomously implementing experiments with performance feedback.

Result: While quantitative results are embargoed, the paper highlights the design and workflow, showing potential for LLM-driven agents to democratize GPU optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-driven automation can accelerate GPU kernel optimization, particularly in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

*Shashwat Khandelwal, Jakoba Petri-Koenig, Thomas B. Preußer, Michaela Blott, Shreejith Shanker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to deploy LSTMs on FPGAs using the FINN framework, addressing computational complexity and enabling efficient real-time deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNNs, especially LSTMs, are computationally complex, making real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments challenging. FPGAs offer energy-efficient acceleration but lack generalized tools for LSTM deployment.

Method: The authors leverage the FINN framework and ONNX's Scan operator to model LSTM computations, enabling mixed quantization and functional verification. Custom transformations map quantized ONNX graphs to hardware blocks.

Result: The proposed tool-flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource consumption while maintaining or improving inference accuracy with reduced precision.

Conclusion: The method paves the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs, offering a generalized solution for LSTM deployment.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

TL;DR: Hellsemble is a novel ensemble framework for binary classification that improves accuracy and efficiency by partitioning data by difficulty and using specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods like bagging and boosting are computationally expensive and struggle with heterogeneous data.

Method: Hellsemble partitions data into difficulty levels, trains specialized models on each, and uses a router to assign instances.

Result: Outperforms classical methods on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks.

Conclusion: Instance-level difficulty is key for efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

*Furkan Mumcu, Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for detecting adversarial examples in DNNs by analyzing layer-wise attack impacts, offering efficiency, universality, and compatibility across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods against adversarial attacks are either ineffective or computationally inefficient, prompting the need for a practical detection approach.

Method: Trains a lightweight regression model to predict deeper-layer features from early-layer features, using prediction error to detect adversarial samples.

Result: Highly effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, and compatible with any DNN architecture and domain (image, video, audio).

Conclusion: The proposed detection method is a practical and universal solution for adversarial example detection in DNNs.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

TL;DR: SpLPG addresses performance degradation in distributed GNN training for link prediction by using graph sparsification, reducing communication costs by up to 80% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed GNN frameworks are optimized for node classification, leaving link prediction performance underexplored, especially regarding information loss from graph partitioning and negative sampling.

Method: The paper investigates performance degradation in distributed GNN training for link prediction and proposes SpLPG, which uses graph sparsification to mitigate information loss and reduce communication costs.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show SpLPG reduces communication overhead by ~80% while preserving link prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: SpLPG effectively balances communication efficiency and accuracy in distributed GNN training for link prediction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Motivation: To enhance communication quality in dynamic environments by efficiently allocating time between tracking multiple targets and data transmission.

Method: Proposes a CDRL framework to optimize resource allocation under time budget constraints.

Result: Demonstrates improved communication quality while adhering to time constraints in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: The CDRL approach effectively maximizes communication quality in integrated sensing and communication systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of adaptive time allocation in integrated

Motivation: To address the trade-off between scanning for new targets and tracking existing ones in cognitive radar systems.

Method: Formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, solved using DDPG and SAC algorithms, with NSGA-II for Pareto front estimation.

Result: Both DDPG and SAC are effective, but SAC shows better stability and sample efficiency. NSGA-II provides an upper bound on the Pareto front.

Conclusion: This approach enhances cognitive radar systems by balancing competing objectives in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining task performance, diverging from pre-training trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of memorization in fine-tuning, especially for LoRA, a parameter-efficient method, and compare it with full fine-tuning.

Method: Uses a similarity-based memorization metric to evaluate memorization risks in LoRA fine-tuning versus full fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning significantly reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, despite model scale and data duplication not following pre-training trends.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning offers a safer alternative to full fine-tuning in terms of memorization risks without compromising performance.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream
applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and

TL;DR: RWFT is a lightweight unlearning method that erases a class from a trained classifier without retraining, outperforming existing methods in metrics and robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enforce user deletion rights and mitigate biased predictions without costly retraining.

Method: Output-reweighting technique redistributing probability mass for the forgotten class, robust to MIA-NN attacks.

Result: Matches retraining performance, gains 2.79% in prior metrics and 111.45% in new TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT is effective, efficient, and robust, setting a new standard for machine unlearning.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

*Erfan Hajihashemi, Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm is proposed to dynamically select effective models, reducing computational complexity and prediction set size while maintaining coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of computational complexity and poor performance due to irrelevant models in multi-model online conformal prediction.

Method: Uses a bipartite graph to refine model selection dynamically, leveraging feedback like prediction set size and model loss.

Result: Ensures valid coverage, achieves sublinear regret, and constructs smaller prediction sets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm improves efficiency and performance in multi-model online conformal prediction, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

### [307] [Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20904)
*Matthew Zurek, Guy Zamir, Yudong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, focusing on challenges like distribution shift and non-uniform coverage. It introduces sharp guarantees based on target policy-specific measures (bias span and policy hitting radius) and a novel algorithm with quantile clipping, achieving the first single-policy sample complexity bound for this setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of prior work, which relied on uniform complexity measures and restrictive structural assumptions, by developing guarantees and algorithms tailored to the target policy.

Method: The method involves a pessimistic discounted value iteration algorithm enhanced with quantile clipping, enabling sharper empirical-span-based penalties without prior parameter knowledge.

Result: The results include the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL, handling general weakly communicating MDPs, and demonstrating the necessity of coverage assumptions beyond the target policy's stationary distribution.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that learning under their conditions requires broader coverage assumptions than previously considered, distinguishing their approach from prior work, and provides nearly matching lower bounds.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'black box' nature of neural networks and improve explainability in decision-making for radar resource management.

Method: Proposes DL-LIME, which integrates deep learning into LIME's sampling process to account for feature correlations.

Result: DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME in fidelity and task performance, providing clearer insights into decision-making factors.

Conclusion: DL-LIME enhances explainability and performance in radar resource management, offering a more interpretable AI solution.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework autonomously infers chemical process constraints and optimizes performance without predefined bounds, achieving faster convergence and better efficiency than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods fail when operational constraints are ill-defined, requiring subjective heuristics. This work addresses the bottleneck of constraint definition.

Method: Uses a multi-agent LLM framework (AutoGen with OpenAI's o3) for autonomous constraint generation and iterative optimization, validated on the hydrodealkylation process.

Result: Achieved competitive performance with conventional methods, 31-fold speedup over grid search, and converged in under 20 minutes.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for poorly characterized constraints, offering computational efficiency and domain-informed optimization.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

*Shahrzad Behzadimanesh, Pierre Le Bodic, Geoffrey I. Webb, Mario Boley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends classical rule ensembles by introducing learnable sparse linear transformations to improve model accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule ensembles rely on axis-parallel decision regions, which require curated features for accuracy. This limits interpretability when features are lacking.

Method: The authors propose using logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations (e.g., $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$) and a sequential greedy optimization method.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves comparable test risk to state-of-the-art methods while reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: The approach enhances interpretability and accuracy by enabling oblique decision regions, validated across benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSA, a new algorithm for efficiently unlearning problematic datapoints in large language models by leveraging model checkpoints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often train on problematic data (private, copyrighted, or inaccurate), and complete retraining is impractical. Unlearning algorithms offer a low-cost solution but face challenges in precisely undoing datapoint influence.

Method: The proposed MSA algorithm estimates and undoes the influence of problematic datapoints using model checkpoints from different pretraining stages.

Result: MSA outperforms existing unlearning algorithms across benchmarks, models, and metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MSA provides a flexible and efficient approach for data erasure in large language models, addressing the limitations of current unlearning methods.

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational methods struggle with capturing geometric features and generalizing to novel antigen interfaces, limiting antibody design.

Method: AbMEGD integrates multi-scale equivariant graph diffusion, combining atomic-level geometric features with residue-level embeddings for precise and efficient antibody design.

Result: AbMEGD shows a 10.13% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32% improvement percentage, and 0.062 Å reduction in RMSD in the CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb.

Conclusion: AbMEGD sets a new benchmark for antibody sequence-structure co-design, balancing structural integrity and functionality.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharpZO is a hybrid method combining sharpness-aware evolutionary strategies (ES) and zeroth-order (ZO) optimization to fine-tune VLMs without backpropagation, achieving better performance than existing forward-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BP-free fine-tuning methods for VLMs often underperform due to reliance on high-variance ES or ZO optimization. SharpZO aims to improve accuracy and convergence.

Method: SharpZO uses a two-stage process: sharpness-aware ES for global exploration and smoothing, followed by sparse ZO optimization for local refinement, all without backpropagation.

Result: SharpZO outperforms state-of-the-art forward-only methods, achieving up to 7% average accuracy gain and faster convergence.

Conclusion: SharpZO provides an effective BP-free fine-tuning solution for VLMs, enhancing performance for memory-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally

### [314] [Distilling Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21003)
*Steven Walton, Valeriy Klyukin, Maksim Artemev, Denis Derkach, Nikita Orlov, Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores knowledge distillation techniques to improve smaller normalizing flows, enhancing sampling quality and density estimation while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit density learners like normalizing flows offer advantages over GANs but face challenges in training and sampling quality. This work aims to improve smaller models via knowledge distillation.

Method: The study introduces novel knowledge distillation techniques for compositional normalizing flows, leveraging non-traditional knowledge transfer between intermediate layers.

Result: Distilled student models achieve significant performance gains and increased throughput due to reduced parameters.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation in normalizing flows enables smaller, efficient models without sacrificing performance, addressing key limitations.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

*Feng Jiang, Mangal Prakash, Hehuan Ma, Jianyuan Deng, Yuzhi Guo, Amina Mollaysa, Tommaso Mansi, Rui Liao, Junzhou Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIDENT integrates molecular SMILES, text, and taxonomic data for rich molecular representations, outperforming prior methods on 11 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works neglect textual and taxonomic data in molecular representation learning, limiting performance.

Method: TRIDENT uses volume-based and local alignment objectives to align tri-modal features (SMILES, text, taxonomy) and a momentum-based mechanism for balance.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Combining SMILES, text, and taxonomy enhances molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

### [316] [Little By Little: Continual Learning via Self-Activated Sparse Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21035)
*Haodong Lu, Chongyang Zhao, Jason Xue, Lina Yao, Kristen Moore, Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoRA introduces a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach for continual learning, addressing interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing by decomposing rank updates into fine-grained rank-1 experts with self-activated relevance and sparse activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models, such as catastrophic forgetting and task interference, caused by coarse adapter-level selection in existing LoRA-based MoE approaches.

Method: MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components (experts), enabling fine-grained utilization. It includes self-activated relevance inference for each expert, rank pruning, and activation budgets for adaptive sparse rank selection.

Result: MoRA significantly enhances CL with pre-trained models, improving generalization and mitigating forgetting, validated on CLIP and LLMs.

Conclusion: MoRA effectively addresses interference, redundancy, and routing ambiguity in CL, offering a robust solution for continual learning with large models.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

*Jaebak Hwang, Sanghyeon Lee, Jeongmo Kim, Seungyul Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSE is a hierarchical RL framework enforcing strict subgoal reachability, improving exploration and planning for long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in long-horizon goal-conditioned RL, such as sparse rewards and subgoal infeasibility.

Method: Uses Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE) with decoupled exploration and failure-aware path refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in efficiency and success rate across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE effectively tackles long-horizon RL challenges with structured constraints and dynamic planning.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes federated learning (FL) under concept drift, proposes an algorithm to mitigate performance degradation, and validates it experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting distributions, causing concept drift, which degrades FL performance. This work aims to address this issue.

Method: The paper models concept drift as a Markov chain, introduces the Stationary Generalization Error, and proposes an algorithm regularizing empirical risk minimization with KL divergence and mutual information.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches for three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, random) and is validated using an FL testbed with Raspberry Pi4 devices.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively adapts to concept drift in FL, enhancing long-term performance and demonstrating a clear performance-cost tradeoff.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

*Suorong Yang, Peijia Li, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RL-Selector, a reinforcement learning-based method for efficient data selection in deep learning, outperforming existing methods by leveraging dynamic sample redundancy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training on large datasets is computationally expensive, and existing data selection methods fail to account for the evolving dynamics of sample redundancy during training.

Method: The paper proposes RL-Selector, which uses a lightweight RL agent to optimize data selection based on epsilon-sample cover, a metric capturing inter-sample redundancy.

Result: RL-Selector outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving training efficiency and generalization performance across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The RL-Selector framework offers a dynamic and efficient approach to data selection, reducing redundancy and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

### [320] [Efficient Skill Discovery via Regret-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21044)
*He Zhang, Ming Zhou, Shaopeng Zhai, Ying Sun, Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a regret-aware method for unsupervised skill discovery, framing it as a min-max game to improve efficiency and diversity in high-dimensional environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unsupervised skill discovery lack efficiency, especially in high-dimensional settings. The paper aims to address this by balancing skill generation and policy learning.

Method: Frames skill discovery as a min-max game, using regret to score skill strength convergence and a learnable skill generator to guide exploration. Avoids degeneration with an upgradable population of generators.

Result: Outperforms baselines in efficiency and diversity, achieving a 15% zero-shot improvement in high-dimensional environments.

Conclusion: The regret-aware method effectively balances exploration and policy learning, enhancing skill discovery in complex, high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

### [321] [FedDAA: Dynamic Client Clustering for Concept Drift Adaptation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21054)
*Fu Peng, Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDAA is a federated learning framework addressing multi-source concept drift (real, virtual, label drift) by dynamically clustering clients and selectively retaining historical knowledge, improving accuracy by 7.84%-8.52%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods fail to handle all drift sources (real, virtual, label drift) optimally, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Distinguishing drift types is crucial for effective adaptation.

Method: FedDAA uses three modules: cluster number determination, real drift detection, and concept drift adaptation, to dynamically adapt while preserving useful historical data.

Result: FedDAA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 7.84% to 8.52% higher accuracy on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FedDAA effectively addresses multi-source concept drift in FL, improving generalization by distinguishing and adapting to different drift types.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method uses knowledge graphs to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs, improving their tool utilization and problem-solving abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching LLMs to use tools effectively is challenging due to insufficient quality of instruction data generated by LLMs themselves.

Method: Extract query pathways from knowledge graphs, transform them into user queries, and translate entity relationships into actionable tools to create detailed instruction data.

Result: Fine-tuning on synthetic data significantly enhances LLMs' tool utilization and overall capabilities.

Conclusion: Knowledge graph-derived instruction data is effective for improving LLM performance in tool usage.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

TL;DR: CHOOSE is a shallow Transformer framework enhanced with Chain of Thought (CoT) for wireless symbol detection, improving performance without increasing model depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Transformer models for wireless communication tasks are resource-intensive, limiting deployment on mobile devices. CHOOSE aims to achieve comparable performance with shallow models.

Method: CHOOSE introduces autoregressive latent reasoning steps in hidden space, enhancing reasoning capacity of shallow (1-2 layer) Transformers.

Result: CHOOSE outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and matches deep models' performance while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: CHOOSE enables lightweight Transformer deployment in resource-constrained wireless receivers, offering a practical solution for mobile devices.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

### [324] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson, Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel architecture dynamically skips middle layers in Transformers but fails to improve efficiency compared to dense baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce redundancy in middle Transformer layers and improve efficiency by skipping them dynamically.

Method: Uses a learned gating mechanism to skip symmetric spans of central blocks and a gated attention mechanism to prevent attention to skipped positions. Residual norms and gate sparsity are controlled with specific schemes.

Result: No improvement in trade-off between validation cross-entropy and FLOPs compared to fewer-layer dense baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method does not outperform simpler baselines at the investigated scales, but code is released for further exploration.

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FeDa4Fair, a library for benchmarking fairness in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous client bias, addressing limitations in existing fairness methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in FL is challenged by biases in local datasets and diverse fairness needs across clients, which current methods often overlook.

Method: The authors propose FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets for evaluating fair FL methods, and release four bias-heterogeneous datasets with benchmarks.

Result: The paper provides tools for consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at global and client levels, including ready-to-use evaluation functions.

Conclusion: FeDa4Fair enables robust and reproducible fairness research in FL by addressing heterogeneous bias and diverse fairness needs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

TL;DR: H-CMR is a new Concept-Based Model (CBM) offering interpretability for both concept and task predictions by using a learned directed acyclic graph and neural attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CBMs lack interpretability in concept predictions, relying on black-box neural networks. H-CMR aims to address this gap.

Method: H-CMR models concept relationships via a directed acyclic graph with logic rules and uses neural attention for hierarchical prediction.

Result: H-CMR achieves state-of-the-art performance and supports human interaction through concept and model interventions, improving accuracy and data efficiency.

Conclusion: H-CMR enhances interpretability and performance in CBMs, enabling better human interaction and practical applications.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient fine-tuning method for LLMs using entropy-based complexity categorization, outperforming standard SFT and matching distillation with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing LLM performance in specific domains without the high cost of extensive data and expensive calls required by distillation.

Method: Splits training data by entropy, applies SFT and distillation selectively, and validates on small open models.

Result: Outperforms standard SFT (0.55 vs 0.43 accuracy) and matches distillation with 62% less data.

Conclusion: Efficient fine-tuning via entropy-based complexity categorization is viable and effective.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework called Unlasting uses dual conditional diffusion models to address unpaired single-cell perturbation data, integrating GRN and masking for better predictions and introducing a biologically grounded evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell sequencing is destructive, leading to unpaired data under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. Existing methods either force pair data or ignore inherent relationships, limiting accuracy.

Method: Proposes a Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) framework, integrating GRN for meaningful perturbation signal propagation and a masking mechanism for silent gene prediction. Introduces a new evaluation metric for bimodal distributions.

Result: Unlasting effectively handles unpaired data, improves generation quality, and captures intrinsic heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Conclusion: The framework enhances drug screening and gene identification by addressing unpaired data challenges and incorporating biological insights.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Result: Achieves 357x speedup over vanilla AllReduce on a 1Gbps network for a 107B model, with negligible convergence degradation.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX is the first successful decentralized framework for models exceeding 100B parameters, enabling efficient training on slow networks.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

### [330] [Robust Policy Switching for Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for UAV Deconfliction in Adversarial Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21127)
*Deepak Kumar Panda, Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An antifragile RL framework using discounted Thompson sampling (DTS) is proposed to enhance UAV navigation resilience against adversarial attacks by dynamically selecting robust policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods lack generalization to out-of-distribution shifts, limiting their effectiveness against adversarial sensor manipulation in UAV navigation.

Method: The framework derives diverse robust policies, models them as a multiarmed bandit problem, and uses DTS to dynamically select policies, minimizing adversarially induced shifts.

Result: The approach outperforms conventional robust RL methods, achieving shorter path lengths and higher conflict-free navigation rates in simulations with dynamic obstacles and strong adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The antifragile RL framework effectively adapts to unseen adversarial attacks, demonstrating superior performance and resilience in complex UAV navigation scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

*Deepak Kumar Panda, Adolfo Perrusquia, Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an antifragile RL framework to counter OOD adversarial attacks in UAV navigation, improving resilience and performance under attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL policies in safety-critical systems like UAVs are vulnerable to OOD adversarial attacks, degrading decision-making.

Method: Introduces a simulated attacker for incremental adversarial perturbations, uses Wasserstein distance minimization for critic alignment.

Result: Antifragile policy outperforms baselines, achieving higher rewards and fewer conflicts under attacks.

Conclusion: The framework is viable for secure RL in evolving threat environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

*Jiajie Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, addressing load imbalance issues and improving expert utilization without harming performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE systems face severe load imbalance, where only a few experts are activated, wasting model capacity and computational resources.

Method: LPR revisits expert routing through a clustering perspective, generalizing existing approaches to promote balanced expert utilization.

Result: LPR reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 and improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving near-perfect load balancing.

Conclusion: LPR effectively balances expert utilization in MoE models, enhancing efficiency without compromising downstream performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

*Weikang Meng, Yadan Luo, Liangyu Huo, Yaowei Wang, Xin Li, Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Norm-Aware Linear Attention (NaLaFormer) to address entropy gaps and missing interactions in linear attention by decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction components, improving performance on vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear attention methods neglect query norms and inhibit negative values, leading to entropy gaps and missing interactions. The paper aims to restore dynamic spikiness and norm consistency.

Method: Proposes decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction components, using a query-norm aware kernel for dynamic entropy control and a norm-preserving mapping for non-negativity.

Result: NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks by up to 4.2%, enhancing expressiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of linear attention, achieving better performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

*Ziwei Wang, Hongbin Wang, Tianwang Jia, Xingyi He, Siyang Li, Dongrui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer network, improves EEG decoding by capturing long-range temporal dependencies and inter-channel interactions, outperforming 10 baseline models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs struggle with long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel relationships in EEG decoding. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids lack optimal local-global feature integration and explicit channel-wise modeling.

Method: Proposes DBConformer, combining a temporal Conformer for long-range dependencies and a spatial Conformer for inter-channel interactions, enhanced by a channel attention module.

Result: Outperforms 10 baseline models on five MI and two seizure detection datasets, with eight times fewer parameters than EEG Conformer. Features are physiologically interpretable.

Conclusion: DBConformer offers robust, explainable EEG decoding with superior performance and interpretability, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code

*Colin Samplawski, Adam D. Cobb, Manoj Acharya, Ramneet Kaur, Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScalaBL introduces a scalable Bayesian low-rank adaptation method for LLMs, achieving competitive performance with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of uncertainty quantification in LLMs, especially in high-stakes domains, due to their tendency to hallucinate and poor calibration.

Method: Performs Bayesian inference in an r-dimensional subspace using LoRA parameters as projection matrices, enabling stochastic variational inference.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods using only ~1000 additional parameters and scales to larger LLMs.

Conclusion: ScalaBL offers a scalable and efficient solution for Bayesian inference in LLMs, significantly reducing parameter overhead while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

*Deepak Kumar Panda, Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cGAN-based framework is introduced to craft stealthy adversarial attacks on UAV IDS, with a CVAE detector outperforming traditional methods in identifying such threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDS methods fail to detect novel or stealthy adversarial attacks, necessitating advanced probabilistic modeling for resilience.

Method: A multi-class IDS classifier is trained on benign and known attack data, then a cGAN generates adversarial samples. A CVAE detector uses negative log-likelihood to identify these threats.

Result: The CVAE-based detector significantly outperforms traditional methods in detecting stealthy adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling, like CVAE, is crucial for robust IDS against generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel linearity-based compression method for neural networks, achieving lossless compression to 1/4 of original size without interfering with existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural network compression by leveraging linearity in ReLU-like activations, allowing merging of layers.

Method: Measures linearity in neurons with ReLU-like activations to merge layers, reducing weights. Evaluated experimentally.

Result: Achieves lossless compression to 1/4 of original size, works well with existing importance-based pruning.

Conclusion: Introduces a new compression method for smaller, more efficient neural networks, compatible with other techniques.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

TL;DR: pFedDC is a personalized federated learning framework using dual-prompt learning and cross fusion to address data heterogeneity and joint label-domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges from data, computation, and communication heterogeneity. Existing methods overlook joint label-domain shifts and rely only on text prompts.

Method: pFedDC employs dual-prompt learning (global and local prompts) and a cross-fusion module to integrate prompts adaptively for personalized representations.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show pFedDC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling heterogeneity.

Conclusion: pFedDC effectively addresses heterogeneity in federated learning by leveraging dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating instances in real-world applications like reinforcement learning is costly, and diverse exploration is crucial to avoid mode collapse.

Method: Proposes diverse mini-batch selection using determinantal point processes, tested in drug discovery with molecular generation oracles.

Result: The framework significantly improves solution diversity while maintaining high quality, aiding faster drug discovery.

Conclusion: Diverse mini-batch selection enhances exploration in reinforcement learning, particularly beneficial in drug discovery for finding diverse, high-quality solutions.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

TL;DR: Perpetual voting fairness is improved by Artificial Delegates, which compensate for absenteeism and enhance representativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness in sequential decision-making by tackling partial turnout, a common issue in practice.

Method: Integrate Artificial Delegates (preference-learning agents) into perpetual voting systems to represent absent voters.

Result: Artificial Delegates mitigate fairness issues caused by absenteeism and improve robustness.

Conclusion: Artificial Delegates effectively compensate for missing participation, enhancing fairness in perpetual voting.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clustering performance by formalizing and improving randomized seeding techniques, addressing limitations of current methods like k-means++.

Method: Proposes families of initialization methods using lookahead (aligning seed selection with final metrics) and multipass strategies (reducing randomization effects).

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in final metrics (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for k-GMM) over classical methods, with modest overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are practical candidates for standard seeding techniques and open new theoretical avenues for analysis.

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variability in neural activity and EEG hardware constraints make developing robust BCI systems challenging. Existing methods fail to capture spatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals.

Method: AGTCNet leverages EEG electrode topography and integrates GCAT to learn spatiotemporal EEG representations.

Result: AGTCNet achieved state-of-the-art performance with reduced model size (49.87%) and faster inference (64.65%). It scored 66.82% (subject-independent) and 82.88% (subject-specific) on BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, and 64.14%/85.22% (4-class/2-class) on EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset.

Conclusion: AGTCNet is effective and practical for BCI deployment, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

### [345] [Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21352)
*Le Vu Anh, Mehmet Dik, Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves a uniform Lipschitz bound for persistent Laplacian eigenvalues, ensuring stability under local updates in spectral topological data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downstream tools like heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks rely on persistent Laplacian eigenvalues, but the impact of adding a single simplex on these eigenvalues was unknown.

Method: The authors establish a uniform Lipschitz bound, showing that adding one simplex changes any up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue by at most twice the Euclidean norm of the simplex's boundary.

Result: The bound is independent of filtration scale and complex size, providing eigenvalue-level robustness for spectral topological data analysis.

Conclusion: This guarantees stable spectral features under local updates and reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

*Melanie Rieff, Maya Varma, Ossian Rabow, Subathra Adithan, Julie Kim, Ken Chang, Hannah Lee, Nidhi Rohatgi, Christian Bluethgen, Mohamed S. Muneer, Jean-Benoit Delbrouck, Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMMILE and SMMILE++ are expert-driven benchmarks for multimodal in-context learning (ICL) in medicine, revealing limitations in current MLLMs' ability to learn from context, with performance affected by irrelevant examples and recency bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore multimodal ICL in medicine, where clinicians adapt to specialized tasks from limited examples, and assess MLLMs' capability in this domain.

Method: Introduction of SMMILE and SMMILE++ benchmarks, curated by medical experts, with 111 and 1038 problems respectively, covering diverse medical tasks. Evaluation of 15 MLLMs on these benchmarks.

Result: Most MLLMs show poor multimodal ICL ability; ICL improves performance by only 8-9.4%. Performance degrades with irrelevant examples and improves with recency bias.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have critical limitations in multimodal ICL for medical tasks, highlighting the need for improved models.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

Motivation: To enhance sample efficiency and long-term training in pixel-based deep reinforcement learning by regularizing Q-value distributions.

Method: Uses an auxiliary MSE loss to equalize Q-value distributions across augmented images.

Result: Boosts DrQ, SAC, and Data-Efficient Rainbow on MuJoCo and Atari tasks, surpassing state encoding baselines.

Conclusion: rQdia effectively improves model-free continuous control from pixels, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: rQdia regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images in pixel-based
deep reinforcement learning. With a simple auxiliary loss, that equalizes these
distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks
respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and
Data-Efficient Rainbow on 18/26 Atari Arcade environments. Gains are measured
in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of
rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state
encoding baseline.

TL;DR: This paper explores using fine-grained error resilience and hardware approximation to improve energy efficiency in DNNs, achieving up to 54% energy savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance energy efficiency in low-power DNN computing by leveraging error resilience and hardware approximation techniques.

Method: Systematically distributes ROUP approximate multipliers across DNN layers, filters, and kernels, evaluating impact on accuracy and energy using ResNet-8 on CIFAR-10.

Result: Achieves up to 54% energy savings with ≤4% accuracy loss, outperforming state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances energy efficiency and accuracy, offering significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

*Chao Zhou, Tom Jacobs, Advait Gadhikar, Rebekka Burkholz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NANOADAM dynamically updates small-magnitude weights during finetuning, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large gradients during finetuning correlate with small-magnitude weights, suggesting a way to optimize resource use.

Method: NANOADAM selectively updates small-magnitude weights, avoiding gradient computation and preserving critical pretrained features.

Result: NANOADAM allows larger learning rates, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and improves generalization in NLP and vision tasks.

Conclusion: NANOADAM offers a practical, gradient-free approach to efficient finetuning with better performance.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ATGAT, a graph neural network for cryptocurrency fraud detection, improving AUC by 9.2% over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing complex transaction patterns and class imbalance in fraud detection, where traditional methods fail to capture temporal and structural dependencies.

Method: ATGAT uses a temporal embedding module, triple attention mechanism, and weighted BCE loss to enhance detection.

Result: Achieves an AUC of 0.9130, outperforming XGBoost, GCN, and GAT by significant margins.

Conclusion: ATGAT validates the benefits of temporal awareness and triple attention, offering a reliable tool for financial institutions and generalizable to other anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

*Gavin Lee Goodship, Luis Miralles-Pechuan, Stephen O'Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Reinforcement Learning approach optimizes low-storage ESRK methods, improving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency in high-order, low-storage ESRK methods is challenging, requiring automated heuristic discovery.

Method: Combines GA-driven mutations for exploration and RL-inspired state transitions for dynamic heuristic selection, reducing parameters while preserving accuracy.

Result: Achieves a 25% runtime reduction in benchmark tests (e.g., Brusselator systems, Navier-Stokes) without compromising stability or accuracy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates adaptive heuristic discovery's potential to enhance resource efficiency in simulations, paving the way for future Deep RL and AutoML applications.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early-stopping in-context learning for tabular foundation models reduces inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference-time costs of tabular foundation models, especially for larger datasets, need addressing.

Method: Dynamically evaluate stopping in-context learning after each Transformer encoder layer, then decode embeddings with a pre-trained decoder.

Result: Up to x1.3 speedup on small tasks and x2.2 on larger tasks with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: Early exiting is a practical strategy to enhance efficiency in tabular in-context learning.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for tokenizing and aggregating images in vision-based models are compute-intensive, limiting scalability and efficiency.

Method: Proposes Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG), compatible with model-parallel strategies and vision transformers, to optimize computational efficiency.

Result: D-CHAG achieved a 75% memory reduction and doubled throughput on 1,024 GPUs in hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: D-CHAG significantly enhances efficiency for large-scale vision-based scientific models, enabling broader applications.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An unsupervised fault diagnosis method for CPS integrates anomaly detection, process mining, and stochastic simulation to automate fault modeling and improve interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fault modeling in CPS is complex and error-prone, requiring domain expertise. This paper aims to automate and simplify the process.

Method: Combines multivariate time-series analysis for anomaly detection, process mining for model extraction, and stochastic simulation for behavior analysis.

Result: Validated on the Robotic Arm Dataset, the method effectively models and classifies faults, supporting predictive maintenance and digital twins.

Conclusion: The approach enhances fault diagnosis in CPS by automating model creation and improving interpretability for industrial applications.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSCP is a generative policy for offline RL that combines expressiveness with efficiency by enabling one-shot action generation, avoiding iterative sampling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high inference costs and training instability of iterative generative models like diffusion and flow-matching in offline RL.

Method: Propose SSCP, trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict completion vectors from intermediate samples, enabling one-shot action generation.

Result: SSCP scales effectively across RL settings, outperforming diffusion-based baselines in speed and adaptability, and achieves strong benchmark results.

Conclusion: SSCP is a versatile, efficient, and expressive framework for deep RL and sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of multimodal techniques in detecting deception, especially in dyadic interactions, and to compare early and late fusion approaches.

Method: Used audio and video data (Action Units and gaze) from Swedish native speakers in truth/lie scenarios, testing all modality and participant combinations.

Result: Combining speech and facial data outperformed single-modality methods, with late fusion of both modalities and participants yielding the highest accuracy (71%).

Conclusion: The study supports psychological theories on differential control of facial and vocal expressions and provides a foundation for future research in dyadic interactions, such as psychotherapy.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTS-AD is challenging due to complex dependencies and sparse labels, necessitating a standardized benchmark for evaluation.

Method: mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including LLM-based detectors, across 344 labeled time series from 19 datasets.

Result: No single detector performs best across all datasets, and current model selection methods are suboptimal.

Conclusion: mTSBench enables reproducible comparisons and advances in adaptive anomaly detection and model selection.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench

TL;DR: A training method for ResNets links optimal control theory to neural networks, penalizing intermediate outputs to prune unnecessary layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge optimal control theory with neural network training, enabling layer pruning by vanishing unnecessary weights.

Method: Penalize intermediate outputs of hidden states, akin to stage costs in optimal control, using skip connections and output layers.

Result: Deeper residual layers' weights vanish, suggesting a theory-based pruning strategy.

Conclusion: The approach offers a principled way to prune layers in ResNets, grounded in optimal control theory.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses low cancer screening rates in Telangana by developing an ML-based system for predicting susceptibility and locating nearby treatment centers, aiming to increase awareness and reduce mortality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low awareness and screening rates for cervical, breast, and oral cancer in Telangana, despite early detection being crucial for reducing mortality.

Method: Developed ML classification models (decision tree for cervical cancer, SVM for breast cancer) to predict susceptibility and a system to locate nearby hospitals. Integrated health cards for medical records and awareness campaigns.

Result: The system predicts cancer susceptibility and provides location-based hospital suggestions, aiming to improve screening rates and awareness.

Conclusion: The solution advances cancer awareness and literacy in Telangana, potentially reducing mortality through early detection and better access to care.

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which soft-attention transformers can effectively mimic hard-attention transformers, focusing on specific positions.

Method: Examine subclasses of languages recognized by hard-attention transformers, and demonstrate simulation techniques using unbounded positional embeddings and temperature scaling.

Result: Soft-attention transformers can compute formulas of linear temporal logic and simulate hard-attention transformers with temperature scaling.

Conclusion: Soft-attention transformers can effectively simulate hard attention under certain conditions, expanding their computational capabilities.

Abstract: We study conditions under which transformers using soft attention can
simulate hard attention, that is, effectively focus all attention on a subset
of positions. First, we examine several subclasses of languages recognized by
hard-attention transformers, which can be defined in variants of linear
temporal logic. We demonstrate how soft-attention transformers can compute
formulas of these logics using unbounded positional embeddings or temperature
scaling. Second, we demonstrate how temperature scaling allows softmax
transformers to simulate general hard-attention transformers, using a
temperature that depends on the minimum gap between the maximum attention
scores and other attention scores.

*Attila Lischka, Filip Rydin, Jiaming Wu, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani, Balázs Kulcsár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GREAT, a GNN-based model for solving non-Euclidean routing problems, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with non-Euclidean, asymmetric routing problems common in real-world settings.

Method: Proposes GREAT, an edge-focused GNN encoder, integrated into a reinforcement learning framework for routing problems.

Result: Competitive performance on Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems.

Conclusion: GREAT effectively addresses non-Euclidean routing challenges, advancing learning-based solvers.

Abstract: In the last years, many learning-based approaches have been proposed to
tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of
these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related
transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing
problems. However, models operating on Euclidean coordinates are ill-suited for
non-Euclidean, asymmetric problem instances that are often found in real-world
settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and
edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using
GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we
build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to Euclidean and
non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman
Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our
framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems
and achieves competitive results among learning-based solvers.

*Yair Stolero, Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning method to reduce gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using a convolutional neural network and multiple gyroscopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost gyroscopes require accurate calibration, but traditional methods take too long for quick-start applications.

Method: An end-to-end convolutional neural network is used, leveraging multiple real and virtual gyroscopes. Training involved 186.6 hours of data from 36 gyroscopes and a simulated dataset.

Result: Calibration time was reduced by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes.

Conclusion: The approach significantly cuts calibration time, and the dataset is shared to foster further research.

Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the
deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to
average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the
gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance,
therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require
quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time.
In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using
deep learning methods. We propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network
for the application of gyroscope calibration. We explore the possibilities of
using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration
performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we
recorded a dataset consisting of 186.6 hours of gyroscope readings, using 36
gyroscopes of four different brands. We also created a virtual dataset
consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The six datasets were used to
evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is
reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost
gyroscopes. Our dataset is publicly available to allow reproducibility of our
work and to increase research in the field.

*Advik Raj Basani, Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GASP is a novel automated framework for generating human-readable jailbreak prompts for LLMs, improving attack efficacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and existing methods lack generalizability or produce unnatural prompts.

Method: GASP uses latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes in continuous latent spaces, balancing coherence and attack efficacy.

Result: GASP produces natural adversarial prompts, outperforming baselines in jailbreak success, training time, and inference speed.

Conclusion: GASP is an efficient, scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language
processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak
attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful
responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from
limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks
often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters
or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this
paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel
automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak
prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent
Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring
continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to
improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted
iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that
GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak
success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference
speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that robustness, privacy, and efficiency in machine learning cannot be achieved simultaneously under current threat models due to structural limitations. It calls for research to formalize this trilemma, relax threat models, and design better benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inherent tension between robustness, privacy, and efficiency in machine learning systems, which current approaches fail to reconcile due to adversarial assumptions.

Method: The paper advocates for a systematic research agenda, including formalizing the trilemma, exploring relaxed threat models, and designing transparent benchmarks.

Result: The result is a call to shift focus from universal guarantees to context-aware system design for practical deployment.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for context-aware solutions and better benchmarks to navigate the robustness-privacy-efficiency trilemma effectively.

Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving robustness, privacy, and efficiency
simultaneously in machine learning systems is infeasible under prevailing
threat models. The tension between these goals arises not from algorithmic
shortcomings but from structural limitations imposed by worst-case adversarial
assumptions. We advocate for a systematic research agenda aimed at formalizing
the robustness-privacy-efficiency trilemma, exploring how principled
relaxations of threat models can unlock better trade-offs, and designing
benchmarks that expose rather than obscure the compromises made. By shifting
focus from aspirational universal guarantees to context-aware system design,
the machine learning community can build models that are truly appropriate for
real-world deployment.

### [368] [Next-token prediction capacity: general upper bounds and a lower bound for transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13718)
*Liam Madden, Curtis Fox, Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes upper and lower bounds on the number of distinct context sequences a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token distributions for, proving these bounds in both arbitrary and empirical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the properties of decoder-only transformers, particularly their capacity to interpolate next-token distributions for distinct context sequences.

Method: Proving upper and lower bounds on the number of interpolatable sequences, focusing on one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and leveraging self-attention's injectivity property.

Result: Bounds are equal up to a multiplicative constant, with numerical evidence suggesting minimal parameters suffice for training to the entropy lower bound.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and empirical insights into the interpolation capacity of decoder-only transformers, highlighting their efficiency in memorization and training.

Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens, such as words, the task of next-token prediction
is to predict the next-token conditional probability distribution. Decoder-only
transformers have become effective models for this task, but their properties
are still not fully understood. In particular, the largest number of distinct
context sequences that a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token
distributions for has not been established. To fill this gap, we prove upper
and lower bounds on this number, which are equal up to a multiplicative
constant. We prove these bounds in the general setting where next-token
distributions can be arbitrary as well as the empirical setting where they are
calculated from a finite number of document sequences. Our lower bounds are for
one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and our proofs highlight an
important injectivity property satisfied by self-attention. Furthermore, we
provide numerical evidence that the minimal number of parameters for
memorization is sufficient for being able to train the model to the entropy
lower bound.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the online saddle point problem in nonstationary environments, proposing three proximal point methods with guarantees on duality gap and dynamic Nash equilibrium regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle nonstationarity in two-player convex-concave games, the paper aims to design algorithms with robust performance metrics.

Method: Three variants of the proximal point method (OPPM, OptOPPM, and OptOPPM with multiple predictors) are introduced.

Result: The algorithms achieve near-optimal bounds on duality gap and dynamic Nash equilibrium regret, performing well in stationary environments.

Conclusion: The paper validates the algorithms experimentally and raises concerns about dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as a metric.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the online saddle point problem, which involves a
sequence of two-player time-varying convex-concave games. Considering the
nonstationarity of the environment, we adopt the duality gap and the dynamic
Nash equilibrium regret as performance metrics for algorithm design. We present
three variants of the proximal point method: the Online Proximal Point Method
(OPPM), the Optimistic OPPM (OptOPPM), and the OptOPPM with multiple
predictors. Each algorithm guarantees upper bounds for both the duality gap and
dynamic Nash equilibrium regret, achieving near-optimality when measured
against the duality gap. Specifically, in certain benign environments, such as
sequences of stationary payoff functions, these algorithms maintain a nearly
constant metric bound. Experimental results further validate the effectiveness
of these algorithms. Lastly, this paper discusses potential reliability
concerns associated with using dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as a performance
metric. The technical appendix and code can be found at

*Soumyajit Gupta, Maria De-Arteaga, Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fairness-aware approach for detecting multiple target groups in social media posts, emphasizing its importance in toxicity detection and equitable treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The perceived harm of a post depends on the targeted group(s), making fair and accurate target-group detection crucial for contextual toxicity assessment.

Method: The authors introduce a fairness-aware multi target-group detection method, addressing challenges like multiple group targeting and bias reduction.

Result: The approach reduces bias across groups and outperforms existing fairness-aware baselines in predictive performance.

Conclusion: The work advances fairness in target-group detection, provides a competitive benchmarking tool, and encourages future research by sharing code.

Abstract: Target-group detection is the task of detecting which group(s) a social media
post is ``directed at or about'', with various applications, such as
targeted-marketing. In this work, we focus on the fairness implications of
target-group detection in the context of toxicity detection, where the
perceived harm of a post often depends on which group(s) it targets. Because
toxicity is highly contextual, language that appears benign in general may be
harmful when targeting specific demographic groups. It is thus important to
first detect which group(s) are being {\em targeted} by a post as a precursor
to the subsequent task of determining whether the post is toxic given the
group(s). Target-group detection is also challenging: a single post may
simultaneously target one to many groups, and we must detect groups fairly in
order to promote equitable treatment. We show that our proposed approach to
{\em fairness-aware multi target-group detection} not only reduces bias across
groups, but also achieves competitive predictive performance, outperforming
existing fairness-aware baselines. To spur future research on fairness-aware
target-group detection and support competitive benchmarking, we also share our
code.

### [371] [Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12335)
*Ruiyang Hong, Anastasis Kratsios*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a structured class of ReLU MLPs that are both universal approximators and statistically reliable, achieving optimal function approximation and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between expressive models (approximation theory) and generalizable models (learning theory) in deep learning, the paper seeks a class of neural networks that is both universal and well-behaved statistically.

Method: The authors construct a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with specific width, depth, and weight constraints, using Kuhn triangulations to fit linear pieces and preserve function regularity.

Result: The proposed MLP class achieves uniform approximation of Hölder functions with optimal error rates and near-optimal sample complexity.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that neural networks can balance expressivity and generalization, solving problems like the McShane extension on finite sets.

Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing
perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for
large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers
classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal
approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are
both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural
networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to
generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this
question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer
perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are
statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function
from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$
error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder
exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$,
depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero
parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except
in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further,
our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian
training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly
fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof
technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not
only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our
results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on
suitable finite sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares the Lagrange Index Policy (LIP) and Whittle Index Policy (WIP) for restless multi-armed bandits, showing LIP's superior performance in cases where WIP fails. It introduces reinforcement learning algorithms for LIP, highlighting its memory efficiency. Analytical results and proofs of asymptotic optimality are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of WIP in certain scenarios and propose a more robust and memory-efficient alternative (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits.

Method: Comparison of LIP and WIP, development of tabular and NN-based reinforcement learning algorithms for LIP, and analytical derivation of the Lagrange index for specific models.

Result: LIP outperforms WIP in cases where WIP performs poorly and requires less memory in reinforcement learning implementations. Analytical results for the restart model and a new proof of asymptotic optimality are provided.

Conclusion: LIP is a promising alternative to WIP, offering better performance in challenging scenarios and greater efficiency in learning implementations.

Abstract: We study the Lagrange Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits
with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP
with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies
known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even
though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP
shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose
reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online
learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement
learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous
schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrange index for the restart
model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the
weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality
in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on
exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.

*Xinyu Zhou, Simin Fan, Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperINF is an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method using the hyperpower method and low-rank Hessian approximation, outperforming baselines in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs and inaccurate estimations of existing influence function methods limit their scalability and reliability.

Method: HyperINF leverages Schulz's iterative algorithm (hyperpower method) and uses generalized Fisher information for low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce computational overhead.

Result: HyperINF shows superior accuracy and stability in matrix inversion simulations and outperforms baselines in real-world tasks like mislabeled data detection and fine-tuning data selection.

Conclusion: HyperINF provides a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for influence function approximation, especially for large-scale models.

Abstract: Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of
individual training samples to a specific target. Yet, their high computational
costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets. Existing
methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly
reduced the computational overheads. However, they mostly suffer from
inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the
algorithm. The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous
convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix
multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs
on large-scale models. We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence
function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method,
specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm. To deal with the
computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized
fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix,
which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs
independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models. We first demonstrate the superior
accuracy and stability of HyperINF compared to other baselines through a
synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. We further validate the
efficacy of HyperINF through extensive real-world data attribution tasks,
including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM
fine-tuning. On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream
performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other
baselines suffer from significant degradation. Our codebase is available at

TL;DR: Lab-MAE, a transformer-based masked autoencoder, outperforms existing methods for imputing missing lab values in EHRs, ensuring accuracy and fairness while addressing environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to model complex temporal and contextual dependencies in EHR data, especially for underrepresented groups, leading to biased AI systems.

Method: Lab-MAE uses a transformer-based masked autoencoder with structured encoding for lab values and timestamps, leveraging self-supervised learning.

Result: Lab-MAE significantly outperforms baselines (XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, EM, MICE) in RMSE, R2, and WD, with equitable performance across demographics.

Conclusion: Lab-MAE provides a robust, fair, and accurate foundation for clinical imputation, with considerations for environmental impact.

Abstract: Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records
(EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in
AI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN,
Expectation Maximization (EM), and MICE, struggle to model the complex temporal
and contextual dependencies in EHR data, particularly in underrepresented
groups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked
autoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the
imputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured
encoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their
corresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies.
Empirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost,
softimpute, GAIN, EM, and MICE across multiple metrics, including root mean
square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably,
Lab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients,
advancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of
follow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's
robustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest
that our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of EHR
data, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation.
In addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the a
XGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of modern vision models in global reasoning tasks, introduces datasets to test this, and proposes a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS) to improve learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of large vision models and multi-modal LLMs in tasks requiring global reasoning, inspired by historical challenges like Minsky and Papert's connectivity study.

Method: Proposes chain-of-sketch (CoS), a method breaking tasks into intermediate visual steps, with a focus on inductive CoS for better generalization.

Result: Shows that current models struggle with global tasks, but inductive CoS improves performance and generalization, even with smaller models.

Conclusion: Inductive CoS is effective for global reasoning tasks, offering better generalization and efficiency compared to non-inductive approaches.

Abstract: Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where
local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a
growing interest in tackling tasks requiring more global reasoning, where local
features do not provide significant information. Minsky and Papert put forward
such tasks in 1969 with their connectivity study, exposing the limitations of
the perceptron model. In this paper, we introduce an expanded set of global
visual datasets involving graphs, strings, mazes, and image grids. We show that
large vision models still struggle to learn these tasks efficiently. Similarly,
state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs perform poorly on these datasets. We explain
this learning inefficiency by means of the 'globality degree' measure. To
mitigate this, we propose a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS). Similar to the
chain-of-thought and scratchpad techniques used in language models, CoS breaks
the original task into intermediate visual steps to help learn a complex task.
In addition, we show that not all CoS strategies perform equally well. Our key
insight is to impose a Markovian structure on the CoS frames. This leads to the
introduction of 'inductive CoS' which achieves better out-of-distribution
generalization and performs well even with smaller models compared to
non-inductive variants.

*Ben Adcock, Michael Griebel, Gregor Maier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the approximation of Lipschitz operators with Gaussian measures, proving higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity and bounds on Hermite polynomial approximation error. It tightly characterizes sample complexity, revealing an inherent curse of sample complexity and identifying conditions for near-algebraic convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete mathematical understanding of operator learning, particularly for Lipschitz operators with Gaussian measures, and to analyze the sample complexity and convergence rates.

Method: The study involves proving higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity, establishing bounds on Hermite polynomial approximation error, and analyzing reconstruction strategies from linear samples.

Result: The paper shows an inherent curse of sample complexity, preventing algebraic convergence rates, but identifies conditions where near-algebraic rates are achievable.

Conclusion: The work confirms the intrinsic difficulty of learning Lipschitz operators, regardless of data or technique, by tightly characterizing sample complexity.

Abstract: Operator learning, the approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces using machine learning, has gained increasing research
attention in recent years. Approximate operators, learned from data, can serve
as efficient surrogate models for problems in computational science and
engineering, complementing traditional methods. However, despite their
empirical success, our understanding of the underlying mathematical theory is
in large part still incomplete. In this paper, we study the approximation of
Lipschitz operators with respect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian
Sobolev regularity of Lipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds
on the Hermite polynomial approximation error. We then study general
reconstruction strategies of Lipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary
(potentially adaptive) linear samples. As a key finding, we tightly
characterize the corresponding sample complexity, that is, the smallest
achievable worst-case error among all possible choices of (adaptive) sampling
and reconstruction strategies in terms of $m$. As a consequence, we identify an
inherent curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitz
operators based on $m$ linear samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates
in $m$. On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay
of the covariance operator of the underlying Gaussian measure guarantees
convergence rates which are arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate. Overall,
by tightly characterizing the sample complexity, our work confirms the
intrinsic difficulty of learning Lipschitz operators, regardless of the data or
learning technique.

### [377] [Reducing Biases in Record Matching Through Scores Calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01685)
*Mohammad Hossein Moslemi, Mostafa Milani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a threshold-independent framework to measure and reduce bias in record matching scores across demographic groups, proposing two post-processing calibration methods (calib and ccalib) that maintain accuracy while addressing fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in record matching is crucial due to potential unequal outcomes across demographic groups, but existing methods focus on binary outcomes at fixed thresholds, missing biases in score distributions.

Method: Two post-processing score calibration algorithms: calib (aligns score distributions using Wasserstein barycenter for demographic parity) and ccalib (conditions on predicted labels to reduce label-dependent biases). Both are model-agnostic.

Result: Experiments show calib and ccalib significantly reduce score bias without compromising accuracy, even when standard threshold-based metrics appear fair.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address score bias in record matching, offering practical solutions for fairness without requiring access to training data or model modifications.

Abstract: Record matching is the task of identifying records that refer to the same
real-world entity across datasets. While most existing models optimize for
accuracy, fairness has become an important concern due to the potential for
unequal outcomes across demographic groups. Prior work typically focuses on
binary outcomes evaluated at fixed decision thresholds. However, such
evaluations can miss biases in matching scores--biases that persist across
thresholds and affect downstream tasks. We propose a threshold-independent
framework for measuring and reducing score bias, defined as disparities in the
distribution of matching scores across groups. We show that several
state-of-the-art matching methods exhibit substantial score bias, even when
appearing fair under standard threshold-based metrics. To address this, we
introduce two post-processing score calibration algorithms. The first, calib,
aligns group-wise score distributions using the Wasserstein barycenter,
targeting demographic parity. The second, ccalib, conditions on predicted
labels to further reduce label-dependent biases, such as equal opportunity.
Both methods are model-agnostic and require no access to model training data.
calib also offers theoretical guarantees, ensuring reduced bias with minimal
deviation from original scores. Experiments across real-world datasets and
matching models confirm that calib and ccalib substantially reduce score bias
while minimally impacting model accuracy.

TL;DR: WDNO enhances PDE simulation and control by using wavelet domain diffusion and multi-resolution training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in handling abrupt changes and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of diffusion models in handling abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions in PDE-based systems.

Method: Proposes WDNO, combining wavelet domain diffusion for trajectories and multi-resolution training.

Result: Superior performance on five systems, including a 78% reduction in smoke leakage in a 2D control task.

Conclusion: WDNO is a robust framework for PDE simulation and control, excelling in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Simulating and controlling physical systems described by partial differential
equations (PDEs) are crucial tasks across science and engineering. Recently,
diffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for
these tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model
high-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with
handling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher
resolutions. In this work, we propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO),
a novel PDE simulation and control framework that enhances the handling of
these complexities. WDNO comprises two key innovations. Firstly, WDNO performs
diffusion-based generative modeling in the wavelet domain for the entire
trajectory to handle abrupt changes and long-term dependencies effectively.
Secondly, to address the issue of poor generalization across different
resolutions, which is one of the fundamental tasks in modeling physical
systems, we introduce multi-resolution training. We validate WDNO on five
physical systems, including 1D advection equation, three challenging physical
systems with abrupt changes (1D Burgers' equation, 1D compressible
Navier-Stokes equation and 2D incompressible fluid), and a real-world dataset
ERA5, which demonstrates superior performance on both simulation and control
tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in long-term
and detail prediction accuracy. Remarkably, in the challenging context of the
2D high-dimensional and indirect control task aimed at reducing smoke leakage,
WDNO reduces the leakage by 78% compared to the second-best baseline. The code

*Wan Jiang, He Wang, Xin Zhang, Dan Guo, Zhaoxin Fan, Yunfeng Diao, Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSGM, a moderated score-based generative model, to address unintended generalization in SGMs by adjusting score functions to avoid undesirable data, while maintaining high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGMs exhibit strong generalization but risk unintended and potentially harmful outputs. Current machine unlearning methods fail in SGMs, necessitating a new approach.

Method: Proposes MSGM, which adjusts score functions during the stochastic differential equation process to avoid undesirable data, compatible with various diffusion architectures and training strategies.

Result: MSGM effectively reduces undesirable content generation without compromising visual quality and supports zero-shot transfer to tasks like image inpainting.

Conclusion: MSGM is a versatile and effective solution for moderated generalization in SGMs, with broad applicability across diffusion models and tasks.

Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable
generalization abilities, e.g. generating unseen, but natural data. However,
the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended
generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated
generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the
current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model
after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in
SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard'
does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness.
Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative
Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects
the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time
stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating
undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image
generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU
framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and
DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables
zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image
inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.

*Hojjat Azimi Asrari, Megan A. K. Peters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores higher-order representations (HORs) about uncertainty, focusing on "noise expectation" HORs in the brain, using a novel model (NERD) to explain human behavior in a decoded neurofeedback task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the brain represents expected uncertainty distributions, particularly in contexts like decoded neurofeedback where learning about internal noise is crucial.

Method: Developed and applied the Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to neural data from a decoded neurofeedback task.

Result: NERD demonstrated high explanatory power for human behavior in the task, suggesting its effectiveness in characterizing noise expectation HORs.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how the brain learns and represents uncertainty, with implications for understanding higher-order cognitive processes.

Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order" representations (FORs), which
encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A
less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are
``about" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may
contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct
``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation
processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain
represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored.
Here, we study ``noise expectation" HORs using neural data from a task which
may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback,
wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We
develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion
(NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show
that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.

### [381] [On the Ability of Deep Networks to Learn Symmetries from Data: A Neural Kernel Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11521)
*Andrea Perin, Stephane Deny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates when and how deep networks learn symmetries from data, especially in scenarios where symmetries are partially observed. It provides a neural kernel theory for symmetry learning and reveals conditions for successful generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how deep networks learn symmetries from data, particularly in cases where symmetries are only partially observed during training, and to derive theoretical insights into generalization.

Method: The study uses a classification paradigm with partially observed symmetries, analyzes neural kernels in the Fourier domain, and extends the framework to finite groups and equivariant architectures.

Result: Generalization succeeds only when local data structure dominates symmetry-induced structure in kernel space. The theory explains empirical failures in finite-width networks.

Conclusion: Conventional deep networks cannot learn symmetries not embedded in their architecture. The framework can guide future designs for learning symmetries.

Abstract: Symmetries (transformations by group actions) are present in many datasets,
and leveraging them holds considerable promise for improving predictions in
machine learning. In this work, we aim to understand when and how deep networks
-- with standard architectures trained in a standard, supervised way -- learn
symmetries from data. Inspired by real-world scenarios, we study a
classification paradigm where data symmetries are only partially observed
during training: some classes include all transformations of a cyclic group,
while others -- only a subset. In the infinite-width limit, where kernel
analogies apply, we derive a neural kernel theory of symmetry learning. The
group-cyclic nature of the dataset allows us to analyze the Gram matrix of
neural kernels in the Fourier domain; here we find a simple characterization of
the generalization error as a function of class separation (signal) and
class-orbit density (noise). This characterization reveals that generalization
can only be successful when the local structure of the data prevails over its
non-local, symmetry-induced structure, in the kernel space defined by the
architecture. We extend our theoretical treatment to any finite group,
including non-abelian groups. Our framework also applies to equivariant
architectures (e.g., CNNs), and recovers their success in the special case
where the architecture matches the inherent symmetry of the data. Empirically,
our theory reproduces the generalization failure of finite-width networks (MLP,
CNN, ViT) trained on partially observed versions of rotated-MNIST. We conclude
that conventional deep networks lack a mechanism to learn symmetries that have
not been explicitly embedded in their architecture a priori. Our framework
could be extended to guide the design of architectures and training procedures
able to learn symmetries from data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiency and scalability issues in traditional probabilistic forecasting methods for multi-entity datasets in power systems.

Method: Uses GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder, to generate entity-specific forecasts with flexible outputs (point estimates to full distributions).

Result: Outperforms conventional quantile regression, capturing uncertainty and temporal dependencies effectively.

Conclusion: GUIDE-VAE is a scalable, versatile tool for probabilistic forecasting, applicable beyond household electricity consumption.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting in power systems often involves multi-entity
datasets like households, feeders, and wind turbines, where generating reliable
entity-specific forecasts presents significant challenges. Traditional
approaches require training individual models for each entity, making them
inefficient and hard to scale. This study addresses this problem using
GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder that allows entity-specific
probabilistic forecasting using a single model. GUIDE-VAE provides flexible
outputs, ranging from interpretable point estimates to full probability
distributions, thanks to its advanced covariance composition structure. These
distributions capture uncertainty and temporal dependencies, offering richer
insights than traditional methods. To evaluate our GUIDE-VAE-based forecaster,
we use household electricity consumption data as a case study due to its
multi-entity and highly stochastic nature. Experimental results demonstrate
that GUIDE-VAE outperforms conventional quantile regression techniques across
key metrics while ensuring scalability and versatility. These features make
GUIDE-VAE a powerful and generalizable tool for probabilistic forecasting
tasks, with potential applications beyond household electricity consumption.

*Hao Zhu, Yuan Zhang, Joschka Boedecker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a convex formulation of inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) for estimating unknown reward functions, using CVXPY for direct problem specification and solving, and extends it to handle expert policies given as trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods are nonconvex, posing robustness and reproducibility challenges. A convex formulation (CIRL) is proposed to address these issues.

Method: Reformulates IRL as a convex problem solvable with CVXPY, extends it to handle trajectory-based expert policies, and introduces hyperparameter auto-selection.

Result: Theoretical analysis and practical implementation show the feasibility of applying CIRL without deep convex optimization knowledge.

Conclusion: CIRL simplifies IRL application, making it accessible even without convex optimization expertise.

Abstract: We consider the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, where an
unknown reward function of some Markov decision process is estimated based on
observed expert demonstrations. In most existing approaches, IRL is formulated
and solved as a nonconvex optimization problem, posing challenges in scenarios
where robustness and reproducibility are critical. We discuss a convex
formulation of the IRL problem (CIRL) initially proposed by Ng and Russel, and
reformulate the problem such that the domain-specific language CVXPY can be
applied directly to specify and solve the convex problem. We also extend the
CIRL problem to scenarios where the expert policy is not given analytically but
by trajectory as state-action pairs, which can be strongly inconsistent with
optimality, by augmenting some of the constraints. Theoretical analysis and
practical implementation for hyperparameter auto-selection are introduced. This
note helps the users to easily apply CIRL for their problems, without
background knowledge on convex optimization.

Motivation: To address premature convergence and lack of diversity in standard genetic algorithms for combinatorial optimization.

Method: Introduces new chromosome patterns in breeding to enhance exploration.

Result: Achieves 8x higher fitness, 10x faster convergence, and handles large-scale problems effectively.

Conclusion: GAB is a superior and efficient alternative for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes Genetic Algorithm with Border Trades (GAB), a novel
modification of the standard genetic algorithm that enhances exploration by
incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process. This approach
significantly mitigates premature convergence and improves search diversity.
Empirically, GAB achieves up to 8x higher fitness and 10x faster convergence on
complex job scheduling problems compared to standard Genetic Algorithms,
reaching average fitness scores of 888 versus 106 in under 20 seconds. On the
classic Flip-Flop problem, GAB consistently finds optimal or near-optimal
solutions in fewer generations, even as input sizes scale to thousands of bits.
These results highlight GAB as a highly effective and computationally efficient
alternative for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.

TL;DR: Energy Matching integrates flow-based models with energy-based flexibility, improving generative performance on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet while simplifying training and enabling diverse applications like protein generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lack the ability to incorporate partial observations and priors, which energy-based models handle well. This work bridges the gap by combining flow-based and energy-based approaches.

Method: Proposes Energy Matching, a framework using a scalar field to guide samples from noise to data, incorporating entropic energy terms for Boltzmann equilibrium.

Result: Outperforms existing EBMs in fidelity on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, supports diverse mode exploration, and simplifies training without auxiliary networks.

Conclusion: Energy Matching advances EBMs by simplifying their framework and enhancing capabilities, promoting wider adoption in generative modeling.

Abstract: The most widely used generative models map noise and data distributions by
matching flows or scores. However, they struggle to incorporate partial
observations and additional priors--something energy-based models (EBMs) handle
elegantly by simply adding corresponding scalar energy terms. We address this
issue by proposing Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based
approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples
move along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they
approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a
Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying
likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single
time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a
flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method
substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in
terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based
approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the method's
flexibility to introduce an interaction energy that supports diverse mode
exploration, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein-generation setting.
Our approach focuses on learning a scalar potential energy--without
time-conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks--which marks a
significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe that this simplified
framework significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their
wider adoption in generative modeling across diverse domains.

### [386] [New Bounds for Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08730)
*Michalis K. Titsias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a relaxed variational distribution for sparse Gaussian processes (GPs), improving model training by optimizing extra parameters, leading to better predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing sparse GP methods by relaxing the assumption about the posterior distribution's factorization.

Method: Proposes a more general variational distribution with extra parameters, analytically optimizing the evidence lower bound for regression and extending to non-Gaussian likelihoods.

Result: Demonstrates reduced bias in hyperparameter learning and improved predictive performance on datasets.

Conclusion: The method enhances sparse GPs with minor code modifications, offering tighter bounds and better results.

Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs) construct tractable posterior
approximations to GP models. At the core of these methods is the assumption
that the true posterior distribution over training function values ${\bf f}$
and inducing variables ${\bf u}$ is approximated by a variational distribution
that incorporates the conditional GP prior $p({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ in its
factorization. While this assumption is considered as fundamental, we show that
for model training we can relax it through the use of a more general
variational distribution $q({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ that depends on $N$ extra
parameters, where $N$ is the number of training examples. In GP regression, we
can analytically optimize the evidence lower bound over the extra parameters
and express a tractable collapsed bound that is tighter than the previous
bound. The new bound is also amenable to stochastic optimization and its
implementation requires minor modifications to existing sparse GP code.
Further, we also describe extensions to non-Gaussian likelihoods. On several
datasets we demonstrate that our method can reduce bias when learning the
hyperparameters and can lead to better predictive performance.

TL;DR: A novel method combining model-driven deep unfolding with a mixture of experts (MoE) framework improves activity detection in IRS-aided systems by eliminating the need for prior channel knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional activity detection methods fail in complex real-world scenarios with mixed channel fading, especially in IRS-aided systems.

Method: Combines deep unfolding with MoE to automatically select and apply expert designs for the unfolded projected gradient method.

Result: Outperforms traditional covariance-based methods and black-box neural networks in mixed channel fading conditions.

Conclusion: The MoE-augmented deep unfolding method offers superior detection performance without requiring prior channel knowledge.

Abstract: In the realm of activity detection for massive machine-type communications,
intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have shown significant potential in
enhancing coverage for devices lacking direct connections to the base station
(BS). However, traditional activity detection methods are typically designed
for a single type of channel model, which does not reflect the complexities of
real-world scenarios, particularly in systems incorporating IRS. To address
this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines
model-driven deep unfolding with a mixture of experts (MoE) framework. By
automatically selecting one of three expert designs and applying it to the
unfolded projected gradient method, our approach eliminates the need for prior
knowledge of channel types between devices and the BS. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed MoE-augmented deep unfolding method surpasses the
traditional covariance-based method and black-box neural network design,
delivering superior detection performance under mixed channel fading
conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CompFlow improves RL sample efficiency by addressing dynamics discrepancies between source and target environments using flow matching and optimal transport, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling dynamics gaps in RL rely on ill-defined metrics like KL divergence, which fail when source and target dynamics have disjoint support.

Method: CompFlow models target dynamics as a conditional flow built on source-domain flow, using Wasserstein distance for principled dynamics gap estimation.

Result: CompFlow shows improved generalization and outperforms baselines in RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.

Conclusion: CompFlow provides a robust solution for dynamics discrepancies in RL, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can
significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but
this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition
dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically
address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high
dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often
relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when
the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical
connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model
the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of
the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior.
This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization
for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics
gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions.
Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce
an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in
regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the
performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow
outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted
dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GloFND is an optimization-based method for identifying false negatives in self-supervised contrastive learning by learning per-anchor thresholds globally, improving embedding quality without increasing computation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: False negatives in contrastive learning, caused by semantically similar samples being pushed apart, degrade model performance. Existing methods are limited to local mini-batch detection.

Method: GloFND learns per-anchor thresholds globally to identify false negatives during training, with computation cost independent of dataset size.

Result: Experiments on image and image-text data show GloFND effectively addresses false negatives.

Conclusion: GloFND improves contrastive learning by globally detecting false negatives efficiently, with practical benefits demonstrated in experiments.

Abstract: In self-supervised contrastive learning, negative pairs are typically
constructed using an anchor image and a sample drawn from the entire dataset,
excluding the anchor. However, this approach can result in the creation of
negative pairs with similar semantics, referred to as "false negatives",
leading to their embeddings being falsely pushed apart. To address this issue,
we introduce GloFND, an optimization-based approach that automatically learns
on the fly the threshold for each anchor data to identify its false negatives
during training. In contrast to previous methods for false negative discovery,
our approach globally detects false negatives across the entire dataset rather
than locally within the mini-batch. Moreover, its per-iteration computation
cost remains independent of the dataset size. Experimental results on image and
image-text data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/vibalcam/GloFND.

TL;DR: VIBE is a model-agnostic framework using variational inference to train classifiers resilient to backdoor attacks by treating malicious inputs as observed variables and recovering clean labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of classifiers to backdoor attacks by treating corrupted data as observed variables and inferring clean labels.

Method: Uses variational inference and EM algorithm: E-step infers clean pseudolabels via entropy-regularized optimal transport, M-step updates classifier via gradient descent.

Result: Outperforms previous defenses in experiments against various backdoor attacks, including large-scale and multi-attack scenarios.

Conclusion: VIBE is effective, modular, and compatible with self-supervised learning, making it a robust defense against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: We propose VIBE, a model-agnostic framework that trains classifiers resilient
to backdoor attacks. The key concept behind our approach is to treat malicious
inputs and corrupted labels from the training dataset as observed random
variables, while the actual clean labels are latent. VIBE then recovers the
corresponding latent clean label posterior through variational inference. The
resulting training procedure follows the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm. The E-step infers the clean pseudolabels by solving an
entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, while the M-step updates the
classifier parameters via gradient descent. Being modular, VIBE can seamlessly
integrate with recent advancements in self-supervised representation learning,
which enhance its ability to resist backdoor attacks. We experimentally
validate the method effectiveness against contemporary backdoor attacks on
standard datasets, a large-scale setup with 1$k$ classes, and a dataset
poisoned with multiple attacks. VIBE consistently outperforms previous defenses
across all tested scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online learning with delayed feedback under a capacity constraint, providing minimax-optimal regret bounds for bandits and full-information feedback, with novel scheduling policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited tracking capacity in delayed online learning, bridging gaps between classical delayed learning and practical constraints.

Method: Introduces algorithms with clairvoyance or preemptibility, using Pareto-distributed proxy delays and batching techniques for scheduling.

Result: Achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds, showing graceful degradation under suboptimal capacity, with optimal capacity identified for fixed delays.

Conclusion: Demonstrates robust online learning under delayed feedback is feasible with modest tracking capacity, unifying delayed bandits, label-efficient learning, and scheduling frameworks.

Abstract: We study online learning with oblivious losses and delays under a novel
``capacity constraint'' that limits how many past rounds can be tracked
simultaneously for delayed feedback. Under ``clairvoyance'' (i.e., delay
durations are revealed upfront each round) and/or ``preemptibility'' (i.e., we
can stop tracking previously chosen round feedback), we establish matching
upper and lower bounds (up to logarithmic terms) on achievable regret,
characterizing the ``optimal capacity'' needed to match the minimax rates of
classical delayed online learning, which implicitly assume unlimited capacity.
Our algorithms achieve minimax-optimal regret across all capacity levels, with
performance gracefully degrading under suboptimal capacity. For $K$ actions and
total delay $D$ over $T$ rounds, under clairvoyance and assuming capacity $C =
\Omega(\log(T))$, we achieve regret $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{TK + DK/C +
D\log(K)})$ for bandits and $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{(D+T)\log(K)})$ for
full-information feedback. When replacing clairvoyance with preemptibility, we
require a known maximum delay bound $d_{\max}$, adding
${\widetilde{O}(d_{\max})}$ to the regret. For fixed delays $d$ (i.e., $D=Td$),
the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{TK(1+d/C)+Td\log(K)})$ and the optimal
capacity is $\Theta(\min\{K/\log(K),d\})$ in the bandit setting, while in the
full-information feedback setting, the minimax regret is
$\Theta(\sqrt{T(d+1)\log(K)})$ and the optimal capacity is $\Theta(1)$. For
round-dependent and fixed delays, our upper bounds are achieved using novel
preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling policies, based on Pareto-distributed
proxy delays, and batching techniques, respectively. Crucially, our work
unifies delayed bandits, label-efficient learning, and online scheduling
frameworks, demonstrating that robust online learning under delayed feedback is
possible with surprisingly modest tracking capacity.

*Yuxuan Yue, Zukang Xu, Zhihang Yuan, Dawei Yang, Jianlong Wu, Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCDVQ decouples vector quantization into direction and magnitude, improving accuracy for LLMs at 2-bit levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ methods couple direction and magnitude, but direction is more sensitive to quantization, leading to accuracy drops.

Method: Proposes PCDVQ with Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD) and Distribution Aligned Codebook Construction (DACC).

Result: PCDVQ outperforms baselines by at least 1.5% in zero-shot accuracy at 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: PCDVQ offers a novel, effective framework for accurate and highly compressed LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

### [393] [Generalized Tensor-based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Lie Group Transformations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00851)
*Chongjie Si, Zhiyi Shi, Xuehui Wang, Yichen Xiao, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalization of matrix-based PEFT methods to higher-dimensional parameter spaces, preserving structural properties using Lie group theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of pre-trained models is impractical due to computational costs and task diversity, and existing PEFT methods like LoRA are limited to linear layers.

Method: The approach treats parameters as elements of a Lie group, with updates modeled as perturbations in the Lie algebra, mapped back via the exponential map.

Result: Experiments in CV and NLP show the method's effectiveness and versatility, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed generalization successfully extends PEFT methods to higher dimensions while maintaining structural integrity.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained foundation models for diverse downstream tasks is a core
practice in artificial intelligence. However, the wide range of tasks and high
computational costs make full fine-tuning impractical. To overcome this,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have emerged and are
becoming a growing research focus. Despite the success of these methods, they
are primarily designed for linear layers, focusing on two-dimensional matrices
while largely ignoring higher-dimensional parameter spaces like convolutional
kernels. Moreover, directly applying these methods to higher-dimensional
parameter spaces often disrupts their structural relationships. Given the rapid
advancements in matrix-based PEFT methods, rather than designing a specialized
strategy, we propose a generalization that extends matrix-based PEFT methods to
higher-dimensional parameter spaces without compromising their structural
properties. Specifically, we treat parameters as elements of a Lie group, with
updates modeled as perturbations in the corresponding Lie algebra. These
perturbations are mapped back to the Lie group through the exponential map,
ensuring smooth, consistent updates that preserve the inherent structure of the
parameter space. Extensive experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach,
demonstrating clear improvements over existing methods.

### [394] [Regret Bounds for Robust Online Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06820)
*Alexander Appel, Vanessa Kosoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework generalizing decision-making with structured observations using robust models, allowing adversarial nature choices, with derived regret bounds and applications in robust linear bandits and tabular robust online RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical bandits and reinforcement learning by weakening the realizability assumption for more realistic decision-making scenarios.

Method: Proposes a framework where models associate decisions with convex sets of probability distributions, allowing adversarial nature choices. Derives regret bounds for this framework.

Result: Regret bounds are derived, though not tight, fully characterizing power-law learnability. Applications in robust linear bandits and tabular robust online RL show improved state-of-the-art regret bounds.

Conclusion: The framework offers greater generality and realism in decision-making, with theoretical and practical advancements in robust learning scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a framework which generalizes "decision making with structured
observations" by allowing robust (i.e. multivalued) models. In this framework,
each model associates each decision with a convex set of probability
distributions over outcomes. Nature can choose distributions out of this set in
an arbitrary (adversarial) manner, that can be nonoblivious and depend on past
history. The resulting framework offers much greater generality than classical
bandits and reinforcement learning, since the realizability assumption becomes
much weaker and more realistic. We then derive a theory of regret bounds for
this framework. Although our lower and upper bounds are not tight, they are
sufficient to fully characterize power-law learnability. We demonstrate this
theory in two special cases: robust linear bandits and tabular robust online
reinforcement learning. In both cases, we derive regret bounds that improve
state-of-the-art (except that we do not address computational efficiency).

*Xiang Li, Jianpeng Qi, Haobing Liu, Yuan Cao, Guoqing Chao, Zhongying Zhao, Junyu Dong, Yanwei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleGNN addresses scalability and over-smoothing in GNNs by adaptively fusing multi-hop node features, using pure neighbor matrices, feature fusion, and LCS-based masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with scalability and over-smoothing in large graphs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ScaleGNN constructs pure neighbor matrices, employs feature fusion, and uses LCS-based masking to filter irrelevant neighbors.

Result: ScaleGNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in accuracy and efficiency on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ScaleGNN offers a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node
relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs
face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure
both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large
neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the
over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node
representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To
tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively
fuses multi-hop node features for both scalable and effective graph learning.
First, we construct per-hop pure neighbor matrices that capture only the
exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of
conventional aggregation. Then, an enhanced feature fusion strategy
significantly balances low-order and high-order information, preserving both
local detail and global correlations without incurring excessive complexity. To
further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution
Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order
neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In
addition, learnable sparse constraints selectively integrate multi-hop valuable
features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.

*Daniel Wurgaft, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Core Francisco Park, Hidenori Tanaka, Gautam Reddy, Noah D. Goodman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies in-context learning (ICL) strategies by explaining them through a hierarchical Bayesian framework, linking model behavior to tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why models learn diverse ICL strategies when trained on mixed tasks, adopting a normative lens of rational analysis.

Method: Develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework to predict Transformer next-token predictions without accessing model weights, treating pretraining as updating posterior probabilities of strategies.

Result: The framework almost perfectly predicts Transformer behavior, explaining phenomena like the transition from generalization to memorization with task diversity.

Conclusion: The work provides an explanatory and predictive account of ICL, grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, where the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the normative lens of rational
analysis, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal adaptation to
data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian
framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next-token predictions
throughout training -- without assuming access to its weights. Under this
framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transitioning from generalization to memorization as task
diversity increases. Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive
account of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

*Sanjeev Raja, Martin Šípka, Michael Psenka, Tobias Kreiman, Michal Pavelka, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to repurpose pre-trained generative models for Transition Path Sampling (TPS) by interpreting paths as trajectories from stochastic dynamics, enabling zero-shot application without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TPS methods are limited by expensive, task-specific training. The goal is to leverage pre-trained generative models for efficient and generalizable TPS.

Method: Uses pre-trained generative models (denoising diffusion and flow matching) to interpret paths as stochastic trajectories, minimizing the Onsager-Machlup action functional for TPS.

Result: Demonstrates diverse, realistic transition pathways on molecular systems, generalizing beyond the training data.

Conclusion: The method is scalable, easily integrable into new models, and practically relevant for improving TPS with pre-trained generative models.

Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths
connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the
complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches
use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their
ability to benefit from high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained
models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as
trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score
function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and
flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths
becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional.
This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a
zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific approaches in
previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems,
obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing
beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be
easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant
as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability. Code

### [398] [These Are Not All the Features You Are Looking For: A Fundamental Bottleneck in Supervised Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18221)
*Xingyu Alice Yang, Jianyu Zhang, Léon Bottou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies an 'information saturation bottleneck' in deep learning models, where pretrained features may fail to generalize due to competing features. It suggests task-specific training and richer feature representations as solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring transferred features generalize well to unseen datasets and quantify task relatedness in transfer learning.

Method: Evaluates model transfer from a pretraining mixture to component tasks, identifying the 'information saturation bottleneck' and proposing richer feature representations.

Result: Found that models lose critical features for transfer due to competing features, leading to inconsistent performance.

Conclusion: Suggests task-specific training and richer feature representations as alternatives to relying solely on large-scale networks.

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

*Yiping Ji, Hemanth Saratchandran, Peyman Moghadam, Simon Lucey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern Vision Transformers (ViTs) fail to train without skip connections, unlike CNNs. The paper explains this as a fundamental ill-conditioning of self-attention and introduces Token Graying to improve training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why self-attention in ViTs critically depends on skip connections, unlike other components or older architectures like CNNs.

Method: Theoretical analysis of self-attention's ill-conditioning and introduction of Token Graying to complement skip connections.

Result: Token Graying improves training conditions, validated in supervised and self-supervised settings.

Conclusion: Skip connections are essential for ViTs due to self-attention's ill-conditioning, and Token Graying further enhances stability.

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers
(ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it
is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other
elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal)
when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical
dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous
deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In
this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is
fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip
connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a
simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the
condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and
self-supervised training methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sequential Stochastic Decision Process (SSDP) models to assess Value of Information (VoI) in optimizing communication for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), bridging control and V2X communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CAV decision-making under uncertainty by leveraging VoI, addressing fragmented research and optimizing communication systems.

Method: Proposes SSDP models, defines VoI categories, and integrates MDP, RL, and Optimal Control theories for a systematic VoI framework.

Result: Demonstrates SSDP's advantage over MDP by explicitly representing decision-enhancing information, with a structured approach for VoI-based optimization.

Conclusion: The methodology, illustrated with a vehicle-following problem, shows promise for joint optimization in networked control systems.

Abstract: As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future
sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are
emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning
(ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to
significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X
communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are
closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial
bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision
Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application
in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define
the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The
SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of
information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as
current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI
modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal
Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their
corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to
leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and
``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated
with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization
objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to
illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to
facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and
communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.

TL;DR: Unsupervised method for translating text embeddings between vector spaces without paired data, achieving high similarity across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable translation of embeddings without reliance on paired data or predefined matches, leveraging a universal latent representation.

Method: Uses an unsupervised approach to translate embeddings to/from a universal latent representation, preserving geometry.

Result: High cosine similarity achieved across diverse model architectures, parameter counts, and datasets.

Conclusion: The method poses security risks for vector databases, as adversaries can infer sensitive information from embeddings.

Abstract: We introduce the first method for translating text embeddings from one vector
space to another without any paired data, encoders, or predefined sets of
matches. Our unsupervised approach translates any embedding to and from a
universal latent representation (i.e., a universal semantic structure
conjectured by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis). Our translations
achieve high cosine similarity across model pairs with different architectures,
parameter counts, and training datasets.
  The ability to translate unknown embeddings into a different space while
preserving their geometry has serious implications for the security of vector
databases. An adversary with access only to embedding vectors can extract
sensitive information about the underlying documents, sufficient for
classification and attribute inference.

TL;DR: A GAI-powered semantic communication framework enhances robustness against noise and data shifts using SDEs and a scaling method, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness in 6G semantic communication against channel noise and data distribution shifts.

Method: Uses SDEs for theoretical foundation, a scaling method for distribution alignment, and an LDM-based framework with a pretrained diffusion model for denoising.

Result: Achieves superior performance in low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, robust solution for future 6G systems, outperforming baselines in accuracy and perceptual quality.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness
against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A
theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations
(SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address
distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align
received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on
this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic
communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for
semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for
denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports
zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and
out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for
future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality,
consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data
distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarCon improves contrastive learning by using variational inference for class-aware matching, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of contrastive learning: unregulated embedding distribution and reliance on large in-batch negatives.

Method: Proposes Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning (VarCon), using variational inference to maximize a posterior-weighted ELBO for efficient class-aware matching.

Result: Achieves 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, clearer decision boundaries, and superior few-shot learning performance.

Conclusion: VarCon enhances contrastive learning with better generalization, efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

*Longzhu He, Chaozhuo Li, Peng Tang, Li Sun, Sen Su, Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data poisoning attack on locally private graph learning protocols, demonstrating its effectiveness and exploring limited defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to sensitive user data and the overlooked threat of data poisoning in locally private protocols.

Method: The attacker injects fake users, manipulates links, and sends crafted data to compromise utility. Theoretical and empirical validation is provided.

Result: The attack successfully undermines the utility of private graph learning, and existing defenses prove insufficient.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in privacy-preserving graph learning and calls for more robust defenses.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph
representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many
real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles
in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is
performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning
protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the
privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of
GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy
guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node
classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such
protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not
been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats
is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph
learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack
targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake
users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with
genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately
compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the
attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several
defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness
highlights the need for more robust defenses.

*Sonia Mazelet, Rémi Flamary, Bertrand Thirion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ULOT is a deep learning method for predicting optimal transport plans between graphs, offering faster computation and competitive results compared to classical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal transport for graphs is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. ULOT aims to address this by leveraging deep learning.

Method: ULOT uses a neural architecture with cross-attention, trained by minimizing the FUGW loss, and is conditioned on hyperparameters.

Result: ULOT predicts transport plans up to 100x faster than classical solvers and provides differentiable outputs for further optimization.

Conclusion: ULOT is a scalable and efficient alternative to classical solvers, with potential for accelerating convergence and enabling functional optimization.

Abstract: Optimal transport between graphs, based on Gromov-Wasserstein and
  other extensions, is a powerful tool for comparing and aligning
  graph structures. However, solving the associated non-convex
  optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the
  scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we
  present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep
  learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two
  graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced
  Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural
  architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW
  tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic
  block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained
  from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to
  two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore,
  the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers
  to accelerate their convergence. Finally, the predicted transport
  plan is fully differentiable with respect to the graph inputs and
  FUGW hyperparameters, enabling the optimization of functionals of
  the ULOT plan.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current functional generative models rely on FNO, limiting them to regular grids and rectangular domains. MINO aims to expand applicability to diverse applications.

Method: Leverages graph neural operators and cross-attention mechanisms to create MINO, a domain- and discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling.

Result: MINO broadens the scope of functional generative models, enabling diverse applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. It also integrates neural operators with advanced deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: MINO addresses critical limitations of FNO, provides a unified framework, and introduces standardized evaluation metrics for functional generative models.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of
generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention
due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering
applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and
discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and
rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the
Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and
cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and
discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.
This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse
applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO
provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general
advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of
standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional
generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

TL;DR: PARALLELPROMPT introduces a benchmark for intra-query parallelism in LLM prompts, showing 75% success in decomposition and up to 5x speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world prompts often have latent parallelism, but current LLM serving systems treat them monolithically, missing optimization opportunities.

Method: A dataset of 37,000 annotated prompts is created using LLM-assisted prompting and validation. An execution suite compares serial vs. parallel strategies.

Result: Over 75% of prompts can be decomposed, achieving up to 5x speedups in tasks like translation and analysis with little quality degradation.

Conclusion: PARALLELPROMPT provides a standardized testbed for structure-aware execution in LLM serving, enabling significant latency reductions.

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

methods in quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search (NAS), and
examine hardware trends from MCUs to dedicated neural accelerators.
Furthermore, we categorize software deployment frameworks, compilers, and
AutoML tools enabling practical on-device learning. Applications across domains
such as computer vision, audio recognition, healthcare, and industrial
monitoring are reviewed to illustrate the real-world impact of TinyDL. Finally,
we identify emerging directions including neuromorphic computing, federated
TinyDL, edge-native foundation models, and domain-specific co-design
approaches. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for
researchers and practitioners, offering a holistic view of the ecosystem and
laying the groundwork for future advancements in edge AI.

### [409] [Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO for Dynamic Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19780)
*Yuhui Sun, Xiyao Wang, Zixi Li, Jinman Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, a framework extending Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to handle multiple human preference dimensions dynamically, offering flexibility and adaptability without re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques like RLHF are computationally intensive and unstable, while DPO lacks flexibility for multi-objective or dynamic settings.

Method: Proposes a novel framework incorporating multiple preference dimensions and dynamic interpolation via a controllable simplex-weighted formulation, supporting listwise feedback.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis shows the method matches DPO's effectiveness on static objectives while providing greater adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances DPO by enabling multi-objective alignment and dynamic adaptability, making it more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

### [410] [Will LLMs be Professional at Fund Investment? DeepFund: A Live Arena Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18313)
*Changlun Li, Yao Shi, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: DeepFund is a platform for evaluating LLM-based trading strategies in live markets, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in finance focus on document understanding, not dynamic trading. DeepFund aims to provide realistic evaluation.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework to simulate real-world investment processes and a web interface for performance visualization.

Result: DeepFund enables fair assessment of LLMs in fund investment, revealing their potential in real markets.

Conclusion: DeepFund offers a comprehensive tool for evaluating LLMs in financial decision-making, with public code available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains, but their effectiveness in financial decision-making remains
inadequately evaluated. Current benchmarks primarily assess LLMs' understanding
on financial documents rather than the ability to manage assets or dig out
trading opportunities in dynamic market conditions. Despite the release of new
benchmarks for evaluating diversified tasks on the financial domain, we
identified four major problems in these benchmarks, which are data leakage,
navel-gazing, over-intervention, and maintenance-hard. To pave the research
gap, we introduce DeepFund, a comprehensive arena platform for evaluating
LLM-based trading strategies in a live environment. Our approach implements a
multi-agent framework where they serve as multiple key roles that realize the
real-world investment decision processes. Moreover, we provide a web interface
that visualizes LLMs' performance with fund investment metrics across different
market conditions, enabling detailed comparative analysis. Through DeepFund, we
aim to provide a more realistic and fair assessment on LLM's capabilities in
fund investment, offering diversified insights and revealing their potential
applications in real-world financial markets. Our code is publicly available at

*Can Polat, Mehmet Tuncel, Mustafa Kurban, Erchin Serpedin, Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: xChemAgents introduces a cooperative agent framework using language models to enhance multimodal property prediction in materials science, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation in performance and interpretability when naively appending heterogeneous chemical descriptors in multimodal graph neural networks.

Method: Uses two language-model-based agents: a Selector for adaptive descriptor selection and rationale, and a Validator for enforcing physical constraints through dialogue.

Result: Achieves up to 22% reduction in mean absolute error over baselines, with interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of cooperative agents to improve accuracy and transparency in materials science.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal graph neural networks has demonstrated that
augmenting atomic XYZ geometries with textual chemical descriptors can enhance
predictive accuracy across a range of electronic and thermodynamic properties.
However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often
degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and
undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework
that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction.
xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which
adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each
target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which
enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through
iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to
a 22% reduction in mean absolute error over the state-of-the-art baselines,
while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results
highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both
accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science. The
implementation and accompanying dataset are available at

*Ze Zhang, Enyuan Zhao, Yi Jiang, Jie Nie, Xinyue Liang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces Real-RSCM, a manually annotated dataset for remote sensing copy-move QA, and CM-MMoE, a multimodal model for detecting tampered images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack realism and spatial logic, failing to meet practical needs in security and monitoring.

Method: Proposes Real-RSCM dataset and CM-MMoE model, which uses multi-level visual and textual semantics for tampering detection.

Result: CM-MMoE outperforms general VQA and CMQA models, providing a stronger benchmark for RSCMQA.

Conclusion: The Real-RSCM dataset and CM-MMoE model address practical challenges in remote sensing image tampering detection.

Abstract: The Remote Sensing Copy-Move Question Answering (RSCMQA) task focuses on
interpreting complex tampering scenarios and inferring the relationships
between objects. Currently, publicly available datasets often use randomly
generated tampered images, which lack spatial logic and do not meet the
practical needs of defense security and land resource monitoring. To address
this, we propose a high-quality manually annotated RSCMQA dataset, Real-RSCM,
which provides more realistic evaluation metrics for the identification and
understanding of remote sensing image tampering. The tampered images in the
Real-RSCM dataset are subtle, authentic, and challenging, posing significant
difficulties for model discrimination capabilities. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a multimodal gated mixture of experts model (CM-MMoE),
which guides multi-expert models to discern tampered information in images
through multi-level visual semantics and textual joint modeling. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CM-MMoE provides a stronger benchmark for the
RSCMQA task compared to general VQA and CMQA models. Our dataset and code are
available at https://github.com/shenyedepisa/CM-MMoE.

### [414] [CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21074)
*Hankun Wang, Yiwei Guo, Chongtian Shao, Bohan Li, Xie Chen, Kai Yu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: CodecSlime introduces a dynamic frame rate (DFR) method for neural speech codecs, reducing token waste and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech has non-uniform temporal information density, making fixed-frame-rate (FFR) codecs inefficient for steady-state segments like silences or long vowels.

Method: CodecSlime combines ScheDFR for inference and Melt-and-Cool for training, enabling unsupervised, architecture-agnostic DFR support.

Result: At 40 Hz DFR (~600 bps), CodecSlime reduces reconstruction WER by 46% relative to FFR baselines, with competitive metrics and flexible bitrate-quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: CodecSlime effectively addresses inefficiencies in FFR codecs, offering superior performance and flexibility in neural speech compression.

Abstract: Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various
downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which
allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However,
speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result,
many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences.
To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for
compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on
neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and
architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and
Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When
integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR
($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to
46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and
similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also
enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a
single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently
outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates. Audio samples are
available at https://acadarmeria.github.io/codecslime/.

TL;DR: A post-training method enhances SSL models for deepfake speech detection, improving robustness and outperforming existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between general pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning for better deepfake detection.

Method: Post-training SSL models on a large multilingual dataset (56K+ hours genuine, 18K+ hours fake speech) and fine-tuning on Deepfake-Eval-2024.

Result: Post-trained models show strong robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

Conclusion: Post-training significantly improves deepfake speech detection, with models and code made publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce a post-training approach that adapts self-supervised learning
(SSL) models for deepfake speech detection by bridging the gap between general
pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning. We present AntiDeepfake models, a
series of post-trained models developed using a large-scale multilingual speech
dataset containing over 56,000 hours of genuine speech and 18,000 hours of
speech with various artifacts in over one hundred languages. Experimental
results show that the post-trained models already exhibit strong robustness and
generalization to unseen deepfake speech. When they are further fine-tuned on
the Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset, these models consistently surpass existing
state-of-the-art detectors that do not leverage post-training. Model
checkpoints and source code are available online.

*Jongyeon Park, Joonhee Lee, Do-Hyeon Lim, Hong Kook Kim, Hyeongcheol Geum, Jeong Eun Lim*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved audio-tagging model for DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4 by incorporating additional audio features, a label correction system, and refined training data, achieving a 14.7% improvement in CA-SDRi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed audio contains subtle cues not fully captured by mel-spectrograms alone, necessitating additional features and label correction for better classification.

Method: The model adds spectral roll-off and chroma features to mel-spectral embeddings, uses an agent-based label correction system, and refines the training dataset by removing irrelevant samples and adding external data.

Result: The system achieves up to 14.7% relative improvement in CA-SDRi over the baseline.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse features, correcting labels, and refining training data significantly enhance audio-tagging performance.

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE
2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral
roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the
mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an
audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5)
system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains
subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,
these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.
Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs
processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the
final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric.
Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy
of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating
external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of
data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could
degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted
systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7%
compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining MFCC + CNN and DWT + RNN were tested for Arabic dialect recognition, with MFCC + CNN achieving 91.2% accuracy, outperforming DWT + RNN. The study highlights spectral features' effectiveness and suggests future improvements like larger datasets and advanced architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of Arabic dialect recognition due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated datasets, especially for underrepresented dialects.

Method: Developed two hybrid models: (1) MFCC + CNN and (2) DWT + RNN, trained on a dialect-filtered subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset.

Result: MFCC + CNN achieved 91.2% accuracy, significantly outperforming DWT + RNN (66.5%). Spectral features with CNNs proved more effective.

Conclusion: The study establishes a baseline for Arabic dialect recognition in low-resource settings, recommending larger datasets, self-supervised learning, and advanced architectures for future work.

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong
baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within
resource-constrained environments.

*Huadai Liu, Jialei Wang, Kaicheng Luo, Wen Wang, Qian Chen, Zhou Zhao, Wei Xue*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: ThinkSound is a novel framework using Chain-of-Thought reasoning for high-fidelity video-to-audio generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-to-audio generation lacks nuanced reasoning about visual dynamics and acoustic environments, limiting authenticity.

Method: Decomposes generation into three stages: foundational foley, interactive refinement, and targeted editing, guided by multimodal CoT reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio and CoT metrics, excelling in out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThinkSound enhances video-to-audio generation with structured reasoning, offering interactive and precise audio synthesis.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both
audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio
benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Demo.github.io.

### [419] [Aliasing Reduction in Neural Amp Modeling by Smoothing Activations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04082)
*Ryota Sato, Julius O. Smith III*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores novel activation functions to reduce aliasing in neural network-based audio hardware emulations, introducing the Aliasing-to-Signal Ratio (ASR) metric for assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for high-quality digital emulations of analog audio hardware drives the need to address aliasing artifacts in neural network models.

Method: The study investigates modified activation functions and introduces ASR to measure aliasing, alongside traditional ESR, testing various functions with stretch factors.

Result: Smoother activation functions reduce aliasing (lower ASR) without significantly increasing modeling error (ESR), balancing accuracy and artifact reduction.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential for improved neural amp models with reduced aliasing, maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high-quality digital emulations of analog audio
hardware, such as vintage tube guitar amplifiers, led to numerous works on
neural network-based black-box modeling, with deep learning architectures like
WaveNet showing promising results. However, a key limitation in all of these
models was the aliasing artifacts stemming from nonlinear activation functions
in neural networks. In this paper, we investigated novel and modified
activation functions aimed at mitigating aliasing within neural amplifier
models. Supporting this, we introduced a novel metric, the Aliasing-to-Signal
Ratio (ASR), which quantitatively assesses the level of aliasing with high
accuracy. Measuring also the conventional Error-to-Signal Ratio (ESR), we
conducted studies on a range of preexisting and modern activation functions
with varying stretch factors. Our findings confirmed that activation functions
with smoother curves tend to achieve lower ASR values, indicating a noticeable
reduction in aliasing. Notably, this improvement in aliasing reduction was
achievable without a substantial increase in ESR, demonstrating the potential
for high modeling accuracy with reduced aliasing in neural amp models.

*Alexander Selivanov, Philip Müller, Özgün Turgut, Nil Stolt-Ansó, Daniel Rückert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PTACL is a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG representations by integrating CMR data, improving cardiac diagnostics without additional learnable weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG lacks functional cardiac measurements like ventricular volumes, while CMR is costly. PTACL bridges this gap by enriching ECG with CMR insights.

Method: PTACL uses global and local contrastive losses to align ECG and CMR data at patient and temporal levels, enhancing ECG representations.

Result: PTACL outperforms baselines in retrieving similar cardiac phenotypes and predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters.

Conclusion: PTACL enhances ECG-based diagnostics by leveraging CMR data, offering a cost-effective alternative to CMR for cardiac assessment.

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

*Minglong Li, Lianlei Shan, Weiqiang Wang, Ke Lv, Bin Luo, Si-Bao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel dual relation distillation (DRD) technique improves CNN-based semantic segmentation by transferring spatial and channel relations from a teacher to a student model, enhancing accuracy without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN models for semantic segmentation are often heavy and slow, limiting practical use. Knowledge distillation offers a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Proposes DRD, aligning spatial and channel relation maps between teacher and student models by minimizing their distance to improve feature distribution mimicry.

Result: Experiments on Vaihingen, Potsdam, and Cityscapes datasets show significant performance boosts for the student model.

Conclusion: DRD effectively enhances segmentation accuracy of compact models by leveraging teacher model correlations, without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Recently, there have been significant improvements in the accuracy of CNN
models for semantic segmentation. However, these models are often heavy and
suffer from low inference speed, which limits their practical application. To
address this issue, knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising approach
to achieve a good trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency. In
this paper, we propose a novel dual relation distillation (DRD) technique that
transfers both spatial and channel relations in feature maps from a cumbersome
model (teacher) to a compact model (student). Specifically, we compute spatial
and channel relation maps separately for the teacher and student models, and
then align corresponding relation maps by minimizing their distance. Since the
teacher model usually learns more information and collects richer spatial and
channel correlations than the student model, transferring these correlations
from the teacher to the student can help the student mimic the teacher better
in terms of feature distribution, thus improving the segmentation accuracy of
the student model. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three segmentation
datasets, including two widely adopted benchmarks in the remote sensing field
(Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets) and one popular benchmark in general scene
(Cityscapes dataset). The experimental results demonstrate that our novel
distillation framework can significantly boost the performance of the student
network without incurring extra computational overhead.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes U-R-Veda, a deep learning model combining UNet, vision transformers, and attention mechanisms for accurate cardiac MRI segmentation, achieving 95.2% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated cardiac image segmentation is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiac disorders, requiring high accuracy for reliable medical analysis.

Method: U-R-Veda integrates convolution transformations, vision transformers, residual links, channel-attention, spatial attention, and edge-detection skip-connections for semantic segmentation of CMR images.

Result: The model achieves 95.2% accuracy (DSC metrics), outperforming others, especially in right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium delineation.

Conclusion: U-R-Veda significantly improves CMR image segmentation, enhancing automated medical image analysis for cardiac disorders.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a
transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of
cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of
cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and
automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The

metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and
left-ventricle-myocardium.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model using modeled spectra improves spectral analysis accuracy under B0 inhomogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance spectral analysis accuracy in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity.

Method: Proposed a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra derived from B0 maps and metabolite ratios, evaluated against measured spectra.

Result: Modeled spectra closely matched measured spectra; the model reduced MSE by 49.89% and outperformed LCModel in MAPEs.

Conclusion: The method improves spectral analysis accuracy by expanding training samples with modeled spectra.

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates 3D US into liver tumour ablation, using 2D US-CT/MRI registration as a key component, achieving low error rates and faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in tumour identification in US images and enhance the clinical adoption of 3D US for therapeutic purposes.

Method: Proposes a 2D US-CT/MRI registration approach leveraging 3D US as an intermediary, along with a multimodal image visualization technique for verification.

Result: Achieved a landmark distance error of 2-4 mm with 0.22s runtime per image pair; non-rigid registration reduced alignment error by ~40%.

Conclusion: The framework enhances 3D US's role in tumour ablation, showing promise for broader clinical use.

Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the
outcomes of percutaneous liver tumour ablation. Its clinical integration is
crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However,
challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader
adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into
the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable
2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to
reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the
registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image
visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a
landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per
image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment
error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated
the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our
integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving
percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the
therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

*Jing Yang, Qunliang Xing, Mai Xu, Minglang Qiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method to improve JPEG image quality by leveraging correlations in DCT coefficients, outperforming pixel-domain methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JPEG compression introduces artifacts, and existing enhancement methods in the pixel domain are computationally expensive. Direct DCT-domain methods often underperform.

Method: The AJQE method identifies and exploits two critical correlations in DCT coefficients, adapting pixel-domain models to the DCT domain for better efficiency.

Result: The method achieves a 0.35 dB PSNR improvement and a 60.5% increase in enhancement throughput compared to pixel-domain methods.

Conclusion: The AJQE method effectively enhances JPEG images in the DCT domain, offering superior performance and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited annotated datasets in brain tumor segmentation by leveraging synthetic data and robust architectures.

Result: Achieves high sensitivity and accuracy in lesion-wise Dice and HD95 metrics on BraTS dataset, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The scalable method reduces reliance on fully annotated data, enabling practical clinical applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for brain tumor segmentation
leveraging pre-trained GANs and Unet architectures. By combining a global
anomaly detection module with a refined mask generation network, the proposed
model accurately identifies tumor-sensitive regions and iteratively enhances
segmentation precision using adversarial loss constraints. Multi-modal MRI data
and synthetic image augmentation are employed to improve robustness and address
the challenge of limited annotated datasets. Experimental results on the BraTS
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high
sensitivity and accuracy in both lesion-wise Dice and HD95 metrics than the
baseline. This scalable method minimizes the dependency on fully annotated

### [427] [Lightweight Physics-Informed Zero-Shot Ultrasound Plane Wave Denoising](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21499)
*Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Mostafa Sharifzadeh, Hassan Rivaz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A zero-shot denoising framework for low-angle CPWC ultrasound enhances contrast without training data by using self-supervised learning on disjoint angle subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPWC improves image quality but reduces frame rate and introduces noise/blurring, especially with limited transmissions.

Method: Divides transmission angles into subsets for self-supervised residual learning, using a lightweight 2-layer CNN to suppress noise while preserving structures.

Result: Outperforms classical and deep learning denoising methods in simulation, phantom, and in vivo data.

Conclusion: The framework is adaptable, efficient, and requires no domain-specific tuning, making it practical for diverse applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores 3D MLLMs for Radiology Report Generation, focusing on design choices like visual input, projectors, LLMs, and fine-tuning. It introduces knowledge-based methods, achieving 2nd place in a challenge, and shows LLM size and volume size impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG) using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and systematically investigate their design for 3D CT reports.

Method: Systematic investigation of 3D MLLM design (visual input, projectors, LLMs, fine-tuning) and introduction of two knowledge-based report augmentation methods.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in MICCAI 2024 challenge, improved GREEN score by 10%, and showed RRG performance is independent of LLM size under same training. Larger volume size doesn't always help, and segmentation masks boost performance.

Conclusion: 3D MLLMs are effective for RRG, with design choices and knowledge-based methods significantly impacting performance. Public code availability supports reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input
representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning
techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper studies spectral estimation of point sources from Fourier measurements, focusing on sparsity-based super-resolution in 1D and multi-dimensional spaces. It analyzes resolution and stability, highlighting the role of amplitude vector incoherence and providing the first stability result for the sparse MMV problem in DOA estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a mathematical foundation for sparsity-based super-resolution in spectral estimation, addressing resolution and stability in recovering point source locations from Fourier measurements.

Method: The study estimates resolution and stability by analyzing the sparsest solution under measurement constraints, considering factors like cut-off frequency, noise, sparsity, and amplitude vector incoherence.

Result: The analysis shows that high incoherence of amplitude vectors improves resolution in multi-snapshot spectral estimation and provides the first stability result for the sparse MMV problem in DOA estimation.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the significance of amplitude vector incoherence for resolution enhancement and advances understanding of stability in super-resolution spectral estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral estimation problem of estimating the
locations of a fixed number of point sources given multiple snapshots of
Fourier measurements in a bounded domain. We aim to provide a mathematical
foundation for sparsity-based super-resolution in such spectral estimation
problems in both one- and multi-dimensional spaces. In particular, we estimate
the resolution and stability of the location recovery when considering the
sparsest solution under the measurement constraint, and characterize their
dependence on the cut-off frequency, the noise level, the sparsity of point
sources, and the incoherence of the amplitude vectors of point sources. Our
estimate emphasizes the importance of the high incoherence of amplitude vectors
in enhancing the resolution of multi-snapshot spectral estimation. Moreover, to
the best of our knowledge, it also provides the first stability result in the
super-resolution regime for the well-known sparse MMV problem in DOA
estimation.

### [430] [Enhancing Dynamic CT Image Reconstruction with Neural Fields and Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01299)
*Pablo Arratia, Matthias Ehrhardt, Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores neural fields for dynamic CT image reconstruction, introducing motion regularizers based on optical flow equations to improve quality over unregularized methods and grid-based solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic CT imaging faces challenges due to motion artifacts from undersampled spatial measurements. Traditional methods fail to account for motion dynamics, leading to poor reconstructions.

Method: The study uses neural fields to parameterize images, incorporating motion regularizers via optical flow equations. It compares this approach to unregularized neural fields and grid-based methods.

Result: Neural fields with motion regularizers outperform unregularized versions and grid-based solvers, achieving higher PSNR in reconstructions.

Conclusion: Explicit motion regularization in neural fields enhances dynamic CT reconstruction, offering better performance than traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate image reconstruction for dynamic Computed
Tomography. The motion of the target with respect to the measurement
acquisition rate leads to highly resolved in time but highly undersampled in
space measurements. Such problems pose a major challenge: not accounting for
the dynamics of the process leads to a poor reconstruction with non-realistic
motion. Variational approaches that penalize time evolution have been proposed
to relate subsequent frames and improve image quality based on classical
grid-based discretizations. Neural fields have emerged as a novel way to
parameterize the quantity of interest using a neural network with a
low-dimensional input, benefiting from being lightweight, continuous, and
biased towards smooth representations. The latter property has been exploited
when solving dynamic inverse problems with neural fields by minimizing a
data-fidelity term only. We investigate and show the benefits of introducing
explicit motion regularizers for dynamic inverse problems based on partial
differential equations, namely, the optical flow equation, for the optimization
of neural fields. We compare it against its unregularized counterpart and show
the improvements in the reconstruction. We also compare neural fields against a
grid-based solver and show that the former outperforms the latter in terms of
PSNR in this task.

*Mahdi Bashiri Bawil, Mousa Shamsi, Abolhassan Shakeri Bavil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel 2D pix2pix-based deep learning framework for simultaneous segmentation of ventricles and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in MS patients, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, speed, and differentiation of normal vs. pathological hyperintensities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRI segmentation methods for MS diagnosis are limited by independent structure analysis, poor differentiation of hyperintensities, and inefficiency with anisotropic clinical data.

Method: Proposed a 2D pix2pix-based deep learning framework for simultaneous ventricle and WMH segmentation, validated on 300 MS patient FLAIR MRI scans.

Result: Achieved superior Dice scores (ventricles: 0.801, WMHs: 0.624) and computational efficiency (4 seconds per case, 36x faster than baselines), with successful differentiation of normal vs. abnormal hyperintensities (Dice: 0.647).

Conclusion: The method addresses key limitations in neuroimaging, offering potential for integration into clinical workflows to enhance MS diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and monitoring rely heavily on accurate
assessment of brain MRI biomarkers, particularly white matter hyperintensities
(WMHs) and ventricular changes. Current segmentation approaches suffer from
several limitations: they typically segment these structures independently
despite their pathophysiological relationship, struggle to differentiate
between normal and pathological hyperintensities, and are poorly optimized for
anisotropic clinical MRI data. We propose a novel 2D pix2pix-based deep
learning framework for simultaneous segmentation of ventricles and WMHs with
the unique capability to distinguish between normal periventricular
hyperintensities and pathological MS lesions. Our method was developed and
validated on FLAIR MRI scans from 300 MS patients. Compared to established
methods (SynthSeg, Atlas Matching, BIANCA, LST-LPA, LST-LGA, and WMH-SynthSeg),
our approach achieved superior performance for both ventricle segmentation
(Dice: 0.801+/-0.025, HD95: 18.46+/-7.1mm) and WMH segmentation (Dice:
0.624+/-0.061, precision: 0.755+/-0.161). Furthermore, our method successfully
differentiated between normal and abnormal hyperintensities with a Dice
coefficient of 0.647. Notably, our approach demonstrated exceptional
computational efficiency, completing end-to-end processing in approximately 4
seconds per case, up to 36 times faster than baseline methods, while
maintaining minimal resource requirements. This combination of improved
accuracy, clinically relevant differentiation capability, and computational
efficiency addresses critical limitations in current neuroimaging analysis,
potentially enabling integration into routine clinical workflows and enhancing
MS diagnosis and monitoring.

*Shreeram Athreya, Carlos Olivares, Ameera Ismail, Kambiz Nael, William Speier, Corey Arnold*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework predicts no-reflow post-EVT using intra-procedural DSA sequences and clinical data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No-reflow after EVT worsens outcomes; current MRI-based detection is delayed, necessitating a real-time prediction tool.

Method: ML classifiers trained on DSA-derived perfusion features and clinical variables from AIS patients post-EVT.

Result: ML method significantly outperformed clinical baselines (AUC: 0.7703 vs. 0.5728; accuracy: 0.8125 vs. 0.6331).

Conclusion: DSA-based ML enables immediate no-reflow prediction, improving proactive patient management.

Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular
thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a
complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular
hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes.
Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on
perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure,
delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine
learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by
leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis
included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved
favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI.
No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on
post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we
extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target
downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our
novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC:
0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331
$\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode
critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a
foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to
proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.
