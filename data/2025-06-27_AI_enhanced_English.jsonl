To demystify\nthe decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we\nsystematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.\nUsing this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how\nit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their\ngeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing\nthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their\ngeneration order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.\nFor RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and\nmaintain training efficiency, we propose \\textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel\nsampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used\nin training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves\nDiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\\% on EvalPlus) and\nreduces reliance on AR bias during decoding.

Through this study, we seek to answer critical\nquestions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which\nrelease strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the\nutility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different\nscenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides\nactionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data\ngeneration methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies\nfor real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper surveys and benchmarks synthetic image generation methods for privacy-preserving data synthesis, evaluating their utility-privacy tradeoffs and providing insights for real-world applications.", "motivation": "The field lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods, especially for training classifiers, prompting a systematic evaluation of privacy risks and utility.", "method": "The study categorizes synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations along a generation-sampling-classification pipeline, using model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs) as a privacy risk measure.", "result": "The benchmark compares generative methods, answering key questions about synthetic data's effectiveness, optimal release strategies, and the utility-privacy tradeoff.", "conclusion": "The study offers actionable insights into synthetic data generation's utility-privacy tradeoffs and guides optimal data release strategies for real-world use."}}

A grasping agent\nthat both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the\nuncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act\nunder high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and\nuncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have\nconnected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method\nfor training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an\nimage-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We\ngenerate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real\nimages and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object\nvariability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects\njointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless\ncontribute to the same goal.", "AI": {"tldr": "A method for training deep networks to predict grasp success based on pose estimation and uncertainty, improving robotic grasping reliability.", "motivation": "Address overconfidence in deep object pose estimators and connect uncertainty quantification to robotic grasping to avoid task failure.", "method": "Train lightweight deep networks using data from real image pose estimation and simulated grasping, leveraging joint training on diverse objects.", "result": "Networks trained on diverse objects jointly improve grasp success prediction, despite high variability.", "conclusion": "Joint training on diverse objects enhances grasp prediction, bridging pose estimation and robotic grasping effectively."}}
