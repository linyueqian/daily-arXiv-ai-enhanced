Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRefSAM enhances SAM for remote sensing by automating prompts and adapting to domain-specific features using few-shot learning, outperforming existing methods.", "motivation": "SAM struggles with manual prompt inefficiency and domain adaptability in remote sensing, especially for dense or novel objects.", "method": "ViRefSAM introduces a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder and Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to automate prompts and align domain-specific features.", "result": "ViRefSAM achieves accurate segmentation of unseen classes with few reference images, outperforming benchmarks on iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$.", "conclusion": "ViRefSAM effectively addresses SAM's limitations in remote sensing, enabling efficient and accurate segmentation without manual prompts."}}

As most\nexisting research on this topic has focused on English-language responses\nrelating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its\nfindings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to\nestablished methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different\nLLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using\nGerman data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate\nthe LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance\ndiffers greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory\nlevels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting\napproaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal\nclassification performance across different categories of reasons for survey\nparticipation results in different categorical distributions when not using\nfine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for\nmethodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their\nsubstantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively\nanalyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need\nto consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response\nclassification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the\ngrowing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be\nefficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study explores using LLMs for coding open-ended German survey responses, comparing performance across models and prompting methods, with fine-tuning yielding the best results.", "motivation": "To assess if LLMs can efficiently replace manual coding or supervised models for non-English, complex survey responses.", "method": "Comparison of state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting approaches, evaluated against human expert codings.", "result": "Performance varies by LLM; fine-tuned models achieve satisfactory accuracy.

This makes it flexible to be used in a\nplug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more\nefficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the\nimmediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct\nexperiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different\narchitectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced\ndiffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing\nalgorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score.\nSG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with\nonly one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a\nsurprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human\nbody structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of\neliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts.
