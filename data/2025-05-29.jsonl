Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate\nextended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as\nmultimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes\nwith increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to\ndrift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language\npriors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced\nfocus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically\nstudy this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a\nmodel's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to\nevaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also\nrelease RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal\ntasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and\nhallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a\nbetter balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is\ninfluenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall\nvolume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that\njointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity."}

However, with the explosive growth of multi-modal information,\ntraditional knowledge graph completion (KGC) models cannot be directly applied.\nThis has attracted a large number of researchers to study multi-modal knowledge\ngraph completion (MMKGC). Since MMKG extends KG to the visual and textual\ndomains, MMKGC faces two main challenges: (1) how to deal with the fine-grained\nmodality information interaction and awareness; (2) how to ensure the dominant\nrole of graph structure in multi-modal knowledge fusion and deal with the noise\ngenerated by other modalities during modality fusion. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel MMKGC model named TSAM, which\nintegrates fine-grained modality interaction and dominant graph structure to\nform a high-performance MMKGC framework. Specifically, to solve the challenges,\nTSAM proposes the Fine-grained Modality Awareness Fusion method (FgMAF), which\nuses pre-trained language models to better capture fine-grained semantic\ninformation interaction of different modalities and employs an attention\nmechanism to achieve fine-grained modality awareness and fusion. Additionally,\nTSAM presents the Structure-aware Contrastive Learning method (SaCL), which\nutilizes two contrastive learning approaches to align other modalities more\nclosely with the structured modality. Extensive experiments show that the\nproposed TSAM model significantly outperforms existing MMKGC models on widely\nused multi-modal datasets."}

To address this challenge, we propose Temporal\nRestoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method\ntailored for MTS data.

During the\ntarget adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and\ntemporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source\npre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore,\nTERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across\ndomains, facilitating implicit feature alignment.

To the best\nof our knowledge, RawStems is the first dataset that contains unprocessed music\nstems with hierarchical categories. We consider spectral filtering, dynamic\nrange compression, harmonic distortion, reverb and lossy codec as possible\ndegradations, and establish U-Former as a baseline method, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of MSR on our dataset. We release the RawStems dataset annotations,\ndegradation simulation pipeline, training code and pre-trained models to be\npublicly available."}

Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in\nareas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and\ngenerative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in\ncomplicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges\nand opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our\nperspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic\nAI."}

While recent\nadvancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG\nreconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a\nkey challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction\nmethod that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike\nconventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a\nfour-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its\nfirst-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This\nmulti-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal\nand physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention\nmechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and\nintra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG\nreconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29%\nreduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces\nimprovements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and\neffectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a\nclinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including\nQRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude\ndifference error.

To address this\nissue, we propose a multi-causal aware modeling backdoor-intervention\noptimization (MAMBO-NET) network for medical image segmentation. Drawing\ninsights from causal inference, MAMBO-NET utilizes self-modeling with\nmulti-Gaussian distributions to fit the confusion factors and introduce causal\nintervention into the segmentation process.

We use global information that captures\nstructural properties of both the trace and the process model, enabling\ninformed alignment decisions and discarding unpromising alignments, even if\nthey appear locally optimal. Performance evaluations across multiple datasets\nhighlight that ConLES outperforms the leading optimal and heuristic algorithms\nfor long traces, consistently achieving the optimal or near-optimal solution.\nUnlike other conformance methods that struggle with long event sequences,\nConLES significantly reduces the search space, scales efficiently, and uniquely\nsupports both predefined and discovered process models, making it a viable and\nleading option for conformance checking of long event sequences."}

Because this transformation is\nlinear, it can be applied with minimal computational cost to millions of image\nembeddings, making it effective for large-scale retrieval or re-ranking.\nResults show that this method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nalternatives, including those that require many orders of magnitude more\ncomputation at query time."}

We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set\nof objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with\nan increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this\nenables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust\ngeneralization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be\ndirectly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for\nzero-shot multi-object perception.

Malicious actors can exploit these systems to deceive and\nmanipulate AI-driven operations. This paper addresses three critical research\nchallenges associated with adversarial AI: the limited scope of traditional\ndefences, inadequate security metrics, and the need to build resilience beyond\nmodel-level defences. To address these challenges, we propose building defences\nutilising multiple inputs and data fusion to create defensive components and an\nAI security metric as a novel approach toward developing more secure AI\nsystems. We name this approach the Data Fusion Cyber Resilience (DFCR) method,\nand we evaluate it through real-world demonstrations and comprehensive\nquantitative analyses, comparing a system built with the DFCR method against\nsingle-input models and models utilising existing state-of-the-art defences.\nThe findings show that the DFCR approach significantly enhances resilience\nagainst adversarial machine learning attacks in maritime autonomous system\noperations, achieving up to a 35\\% reduction in loss for successful\nmulti-pronged perturbation attacks, up to a 100\\% reduction in loss for\nsuccessful adversarial patch attacks and up to 100\\% reduction in loss for\nsuccessful spoofing attacks when using these more resilient systems. We\ndemonstrate how DFCR and DFCR confidence scores can reduce adversarial AI\ncontact confidence and improve decision-making by the system, even when typical\nadversarial defences have been compromised. Ultimately, this work contributes\nto the development of more secure and resilient AI-driven systems against\nadversarial attacks."}

In this paper, we integrate point-based methods into a semi-supervised\ncounting framework based on pseudo-labeling, enabling the training of a counter\nwith only a few annotated samples supplemented by a large volume of\npseudo-labeled data. However, during implementation, the training encounters\nissues as the confidence for pseudo-labels fails to be propagated to background\npixels via the P2P. To tackle this challenge, we devise a point-specific\nactivation map (PSAM) to visually interpret the phenomena occurring during the\nill-posed training. Observations from the PSAM suggest that the feature map is\nexcessively activated by the loss for unlabeled data, causing the decoder to\nmisinterpret these over-activations as pedestrians. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose a point-to-region (P2R) scheme to substitute P2P, which segments out\nlocal regions rather than detects a point corresponding to a pedestrian for\nsupervision.

It has been applied in various fields of scientific research,\nsuch as producing human-readable expressions that explain physical phenomena.\nRecently, Neural symbolic regression (NSR) methods that involve Transformers\npre-trained on large-scale synthetic datasets have gained attention. While\nthese methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from\nlow performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In\nthis study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization\nbias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative\nevaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found\nthat Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data.\nAdditional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the\nTransformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while\nverifying their numerical validity. We finally examined if tailoring test-time\nstrategies can lead to reduced memorization bias and better performance. We\nempirically demonstrate that providing additional information to the model at\ntest time can significantly mitigate memorization bias.

Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of\nQwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %$\\rightarrow$72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9\n%$\\rightarrow$68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth\nlabels. MM-UPT also outperforms prior unsupervised baselines and even\napproaches the results of supervised GRPO. Furthermore, we show that\nincorporating synthetic questions, generated solely by MLLM itself, can boost\nperformance as well, highlighting a promising approach for scalable\nself-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for continual,\nautonomous enhancement of MLLMs in the absence of external supervision. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/MM-UPT."}

To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,\nwe design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term\nchoice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to\ndifferently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting\nthe LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and\nTraditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading\ncommercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily\ntrained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses\nindicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and\nprompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified\nChinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored\nTraditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these\ndisparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written\ncharacter preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.\nThese findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,\nwe provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations\nof future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants\n(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench)."}

The proposed method considers two variants of these VAEs:\nstatic and dynamic with no (or at most a controlled) growth in the number of\nparameters. Extensive experiments show that our method is (at least) an order\nof magnitude more ``memory-frugal'' compared to the closely related works while\nachieving SOTA accuracy scores."}

In this\npaper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context\ntasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of \"needle\"\nconcepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding \"haystack\" context,\nfrom using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations\nand creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data\nfall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted\nand even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are\nresponsible for retrieval over long context, retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024).\nThe retrieval heads learned on synthetic data have high overlap with retrieval\nheads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the\nrecall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore,\nwith attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that\nretrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are\nnot totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic\ndata fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for\nlearning real-world capabilities over long contexts."}

In this\npaper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining\nwhether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To\nguide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In\nthis task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a\nquestion (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior\nor contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer\nfor both intents (either France or England).

Grounding our\nstudy in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model\n-- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social\nperceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities\nfrom both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic\nuse case: text generation.

In\nparticular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both\nconventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical\nsettings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM)\nof up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$\nsystems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments\nperformed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or\nbetter than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these\nsettings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of\nhyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum\nmany-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a\nclear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &\n$J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor\ninteractions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its\nEuclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent\nof the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU\nalmost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a\ntree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU\nNQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin\nsystems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions.\nFinally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of\nnon-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU."}

A central feature of this approach is that this procedure\nrequires no more gradient evaluations than the usual ADAM optimizer as each of\nthe averaged trajectories relies on the same underlying ADAM trajectory and\nthus on the same underlying gradients. We test the proposed PADAM optimizer in\n13 stochastic optimization and deep neural network (DNN) learning problems and\ncompare its performance with known optimizers from the literature such as\nstandard SGD, momentum SGD, Adam with and without EMA, and ADAMW.

Unlike existing methods that rely on\nreconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ\nmulti-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D\nobject generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the\nsimultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial\nrelationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel\nmulti-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object\ninteractions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process,\nwithout the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial\nobject images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object\ncompletion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the\ninteractions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data,\nwhile incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining\nthe pre-trained generalization ability.

In this paper, we study the\n(im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under\nwell-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to\nachieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the\nwatermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the\nattacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark\nattack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or\neven which scheme is used.

Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant\ncommunication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck\nfor efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose\nLV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal\ncommunication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual\ninputs, the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the\nkey-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally\non each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs.

This is the author's version of the work", "summary": "Citation classification, which identifies the intention behind academic\ncitations, is pivotal for scholarly analysis. Previous works suggest\nfine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on citation classification\ndatasets, reaping the reward of the linguistic knowledge they gained during\npretraining. However, directly fine-tuning for citation classification is\nchallenging due to labeled data scarcity, contextual noise, and spurious\nkeyphrase correlations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Citss,\nthat adapts the PLMs to overcome these challenges. Citss introduces\nself-supervised contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, and is\nequipped with two specialized strategies to obtain the contrastive pairs:\nsentence-level cropping, which enhances focus on target citations within long\ncontexts, and keyphrase perturbation, which mitigates reliance on specific\nkeyphrases. Compared with previous works that are only designed for\nencoder-based PLMs, Citss is carefully developed to be compatible with both\nencoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs, to embrace the benefits of enlarged\npretraining. Experiments with three benchmark datasets with both encoder-based\nPLMs and decoder-based LLMs demonstrate our superiority compared to the\nprevious state of the art.

Recent efforts to distill GNNs into\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for faster inference often underutilize the\nlayer-level insights of GNNs. In this paper, we present TINED, a novel approach\nthat distills GNNs to MLPs on a layer-by-layer basis using Teacher Injection\nand Dirichlet Energy Distillation techniques. We focus on two key operations in\nGNN layers: feature transformation (FT) and graph propagation (GP). We\nrecognize that FT is computationally equivalent to a fully-connected (FC) layer\nin MLPs. Thus, we propose directly transferring teacher parameters from an FT\nin a GNN to an FC layer in the student MLP, enhanced by fine-tuning. In TINED,\nthe FC layers in an MLP replicate the sequence of FTs and GPs in the GNN. We\nalso establish a theoretical bound for GP approximation. Furthermore, we note\nthat FT and GP operations in GNN layers often exhibit opposing smoothing\neffects: GP is aggressive, while FT is conservative. Using Dirichlet energy, we\ndevelop a DE ratio to measure these effects and propose Dirichlet Energy\nDistillation to convey these characteristics from GNN layers to MLP layers.\nExtensive experiments show that TINED outperforms GNNs and leading distillation\nmethods across various settings and seven datasets.

Over\nthe past decade, many machine learning and deep learning models have been\ndeveloped to identify and detect instruments and anatomical structures in\nsurgical videos. However, these models are typically trained on manually\nlabeled, procedure- and task-specific datasets that are relatively small,\nresulting in limited generalization to unseen data.In practice, hospitals\ngenerate a massive amount of raw surgical data every day, including videos\ncaptured during various procedures. Labeling this data is almost impractical,\nas it requires highly specialized expertise. The recent success of\nvision-language models (VLMs), which can be trained on large volumes of raw\nimage-text pairs and exhibit strong adaptability, offers a promising\nalternative for leveraging unlabeled surgical data. While some existing work\nhas explored applying VLMs to surgical tasks, their performance remains\nlimited. To support future research in developing more effective VLMs for\nsurgical applications, this paper aims to answer a key question: How well do\nexisting VLMs, both general-purpose and surgery-specific perform on surgical\ndata, and what types of scenes do they struggle with? To address this, we\nconduct a benchmarking study of several popular VLMs across diverse\nlaparoscopic datasets. Specifically, we visualize the model's attention to\nidentify which regions of the image it focuses on when making predictions for\nsurgical tasks. We also propose a metric to evaluate whether the model attends\nto task-relevant regions. Our findings reveal a mismatch between prediction\naccuracy and visual grounding, indicating that models may make correct\npredictions while focusing on irrelevant areas of the image."}

A key trend involves\nleveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue\nstructures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1)\ninsufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales\n(e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual\nmodalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a\nhierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph\nconsisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x)\nvisual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2)\nheterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same\nscale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a\ntwo-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly\ncorrelated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to\nalign textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast,\nlung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently\noutperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving\ngains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate\nthe value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment\nfor efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

However, the consistency of\nembedding differences before and after transformation remains unaddressed,\nrisking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the embeddings. This\ninconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation representations\nare specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar\ntransformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations.\nSecond, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on\nRelations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity\nembeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable\nscore distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE\nmethod, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF). Its entity transformation\nhas three features for enhancing semantic consistency: 1) shared affine\ntransformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) rooted entity\ntransformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the\ntransformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale\nreduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency that preserve semantics on\nembeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and prediction modules for\nenhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion tasks with\ndistance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all relations and their\nfrequencies."}

Furthermore, we also use the action\nlog-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling\nKL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates.\nExtensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion\n(Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow\nHand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate\nGenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines.
