To address this issue, we\nintroduce SongEval, the first open-source, large-scale benchmark dataset for\nevaluating the aesthetics of full-length songs.

Our model supports flexible\nuser-provided keyframe specification, enabling precise control over both\nspatial and temporal aspects of motion synthesis. MoMADiff demonstrates strong\ngeneralization capability on novel text-to-motion datasets with sparse\nkeyframes as motion prompts. Extensive experiments on two held-out datasets and\ntwo standard benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in motion quality, instruction fidelity, and keyframe\nadherence."}

To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a\ndistance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture\ncross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices,\n2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale\nbiological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that\nintegrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter\nand align the essential cellular features across ST and H\\&E images. Extensive\nexperiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over\nstate-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST\ninterpolation.

Because of the ground truth\nnature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g.,\nwhole song).

Although current\nNeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing\nbuilding-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference\nspeeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality\nrendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes.\nHowever, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an\neffective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required\noften lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges,\nwe propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for\noutdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the\ninitialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral\nmesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face,\neffectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we\npropose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D\nGaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain\ngeometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware\ndensification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions.\nAdditionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of\nGaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a\nminimal impact on rendering quality.

Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a\nunified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a\nunified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain\nindependently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without\ninteroperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the\ndevelopment of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we\npropose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake\nimage detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset,\nmodel, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the\nscarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks\nin some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven\narchitecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components\nacross datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible\ncomposition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6\nbackbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing\nbenchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii)\nconducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable\ninsights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation\nstandards.

However, all such techniques can only work with a single (human)\nobjective. In practice, human users have multiple objectives, such as\nhelpfulness and harmlessness, and there is no natural way to aggregate them\ninto a single objective. In this paper, we address the multi-objective\npreference-alignment problem, where a policy must optimize several, potentially\nconflicting, objectives. We introduce the Multi-Objective Preference\nOptimization (MOPO) algorithm, which frames alignment as a constrained\nKL-regularized optimization: the primary objective is maximized while secondary\nobjectives are lower-bounded by tunable safety thresholds. Unlike prior work,\nMOPO operates directly on pairwise preference data, requires no point-wise\nreward assumption, and avoids heuristic prompt-context engineering. The method\nrecovers policies on the Pareto front whenever the front is attainable;\npractically, it reduces to simple closed-form iterative updates suitable for\nlarge-scale training. On synthetic benchmarks with diverse canonical preference\nstructures, we show that MOPO approximates the Pareto front.

We present CUBIC (Concept\nembeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that\nautomatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier\nbehavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias\ncandidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such\ninformation is not always available.

We further examine the difficulties in selecting\nsuitable models, aligning high-quality domain-specific data, engineering robust\nprompts, and orchestrating autonomous agents. We then address the complex\njourney from impressive demos to production-ready systems by outlining issues\nin system testing, optimization, deployment, and integration with legacy\nsoftware. Drawing on our industrial experience and recent research in the area,\nwe provide actionable insights and a technology roadmap for overcoming these\nchallenges.

To\novercome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for\nVLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary\ninformation from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies\nthrough feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive\nimportance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two\ntechniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention.

Our\nDynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and\ndynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale\nexploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging\nlarge-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D\nsets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE,\nREVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for\npre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the\neffectiveness of practical deployment."}

Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of\nsequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to\ndiverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with\nincreasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated\nby this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that\nemploys a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed\ncache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text\nscenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the\ngeneration and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline\nmodels in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs\ntrained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x\ncache reduction.

By processing and analyzing data locally and allowing each agent\nto communicate with its immediate neighbors, diffusion effectively protects the\nprivacy of edge devices, enables real-time response, and reduces reliance on\ncentral servers. However, traditional diffusion learning relies on\ncommunication at every iteration, leading to communication overhead, especially\nwith large learning models. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of edge\ndevices, stemming from power outages or signal loss, poses challenges to\nreliable communication between neighboring agents. To mitigate these issues,\nthis paper investigates an enhanced diffusion learning approach incorporating\nlocal updates and partial agent participation. Local updates will curtail\ncommunication frequency, while partial agent participation will allow for the\ninclusion of agents based on their availability. We prove that the resulting\nalgorithm is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide a tight analysis\nof its Mean-Square-Deviation (MSD) performance. Various numerical experiments\nare conducted to illustrate our theoretical findings."}

It boosts LLMs's\naccuracy and reasoning capacity but causes exorbitant computational costs and\nunsatisfactory Time to First Token (TTFT). KV cache reuse, which reuses the\nexact same KV cache of prefixes and templates or shares similar ones but with\nextra selective recomputation, offers a promising way to tackle this issue.\nHowever, prior studies overlook the cross-request KV reuse and the attention\ndeviations introduced by new tokens during the decoding stage. In this paper,\nwe present a KV cache management module that shares the KV cache across\nrequests under multi-tenant scenarios without sacrificing model accuracy. Our\nsystem, KVShare, enables accurate and efficient LLM serving by 1) a Dual-Stage\nHigh Deviation algorithm (DHD) that conditionally selects a small portion of KV\ncache to be recomputed during both prefill and decode phases, and 2) a\ncache-aware scheduler that prioritizes requests based on their KV cache hit\nrates and orchestrates continuous batching to achieve enhanced system\nefficiency and faster TTFT. Multi-task experiments conducted on models such as\nQwen2.5-7B,Llama3.1-8B and Yi1.5-9B demonstrate that KVShare reduces TTFT by up\nto 9.39x and increases 1.2x of the throughput compared to the full KV\nrecompute.

Based on a comprehensive efficiency analysis of the\ninterplay between image resolution, vision latency, token count, and LLM size,\nwe introduce FastVLM, a model that achieves an optimized trade-off between\nlatency, model size and accuracy. FastVLM incorporates FastViTHD, a novel\nhybrid vision encoder designed to output fewer tokens and significantly reduce\nencoding time for high-resolution images. Unlike previous methods, FastVLM\nachieves the optimal balance between visual token count and image resolution\nsolely by scaling the input image, eliminating the need for additional token\npruning and simplifying the model design. In the LLaVA-1.5 setup, FastVLM\nachieves 3.2$\\times$ improvement in time-to-first-token (TTFT) while\nmaintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works.\nCompared to LLaVa-OneVision at the highest resolution (1152$\\times$1152),\nFastVLM achieves better performance on key benchmarks like SeedBench, MMMU and\nDocVQA, using the same 0.5B LLM, but with 85$\\times$ faster TTFT and a vision\nencoder that is 3.4$\\times$ smaller.

As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can\nquickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory\ntransfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes\nof the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on\nthe feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to\ntransform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by\ninvestigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression\nthrough principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA\nprojection where significant performance degradation is observed at low\ncompression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the\northogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate\nMatryoshka training strategy.

Although\npromoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies,\nexisting works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation\nbetween activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper,\nwe present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and\ninfluential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only\nTransformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\\%$ sparsity, a precise\nand performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any\nactivation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important\nphenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable\nperformance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio\n(i.e., $1-\\mathrm{sparsity\\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing\npower-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data\nfor SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate\nthat ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can\nleverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the\nactivation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain\nbottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture\nat a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we\nsurprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly\nwith the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are\ninsensitive to the parameter scale.

By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by\nquantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the\naforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant\nsolution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is\nconcave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard\n(stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these\nparameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low\ntemperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for\nthe minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent\napproach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it\ncan be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the\nalgorithms.

While XBOT measures withdrawal severity using\nthe subjective opiate withdrawal scale, POAT uses the clinical opiate\nwithdrawal scale.

However, existing methods rely\nlargely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits\ngeneralization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video\nCrafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences\n(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we\nintroduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention\nwith 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as\n4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D\nworld. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new\ndirection for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our\nMTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,\nsurpassing the second-best by 65%.

We show that, under certain conditions, the\noptimal randomised classifier can achieve better accuracy than the optimal\ndeterministic classifier, but under no conditions can it be worse. When a\nfinite set of training data is available, we show that the excess risk of\nStrategic Empirical Risk Minimisation over the class of randomised classifiers\nis bounded in a similar manner as the deterministic case. In both the\ndeterministic and randomised cases, the risk of the classifier produced by the\nlearner converges to that of the corresponding optimal classifier as the volume\nof available training data grows.

To control this noise, we investigated the differences\nbetween models with performance advantages and disadvantages, introducing the\nconcept of \"relative overfitting.\" Based on their complementary strengths, we\nhave proposed an application framework, Accept-Reject (AR). In Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), we use LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) as the medium\nfor discussion. This framework enables SLMs to exert a universal positive\ninfluence on LLM decision outputs, rather than the intuitively expected\nnegative influence. We validated our approach using self-built models based on\nmainstream architectures and pre-trained mainstream models across multiple\ndatasets, including basic language modeling, long-context tasks, subject\nexamination, and question-answering (QA) benchmarks. The results demonstrate\nthat through our structure, compared to increasing the LLM's parameters, we can\nachieve better performance improvements with significantly lower parameter and\ncomputational costs in many scenarios. These improvements are universal,\nstable, and effective. Furthermore, we explore the potential of \"relative\noverfitting\" and the AR framework in other machine learning domains, such as\ncomputer vision (CV) and AI for science.

Deploying DNNs on such\nplatforms involves addressing the significant challenge of balancing\nperformance, resource usage (e.g., DSPs and LUTs), and inference accuracy,\nwhich often requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise. Our novel\napproach addresses two core key issues: (i)~encoding custom optimization\nstrategies and (ii)~enabling cross-stage optimization search. In particular,\nour proposed framework seamlessly integrates programmatic DNN optimization\ntechniques with high-level synthesis (HLS)-based metaprogramming, leveraging\nadvanced design space exploration (DSE) strategies like Bayesian optimization\nto automate both top-down and bottom-up design flows. Hence, we reduce the need\nfor manual intervention and domain expertise. In addition, the framework\nintroduces customizable optimization, transformation, and control blocks to\nenhance DNN accelerator performance and resource efficiency. Experimental\nresults demonstrate up to a 92\\% DSP and 89\\% LUT usage reduction for select\nnetworks, while preserving accuracy, along with a 15.6-fold reduction in\noptimization time compared to grid search. These results highlight the\npotential for automating the generation of resource-efficient DNN accelerator\ndesigns with minimum effort."}

With a\ngrowing focus on leveraging quantum machine learning for quantum data,\nparticularly in quantum chemistry, we propose the Molecular Quantum Transformer\n(MQT) for modeling interactions in molecular quantum systems. By utilizing\nquantum circuits to implement the attention mechanism on the molecular\nconfigurations, MQT can efficiently calculate ground-state energies for all\nconfigurations. Numerical demonstrations show that in calculating ground-state\nenergies for H2, LiH, BeH2, and H4, MQT outperforms the classical Transformer,\nhighlighting the promise of quantum effects in Transformer structures.\nFurthermore, its pretraining capability on diverse molecular data facilitates\nthe efficient learning of new molecules, extending its applicability to complex\nmolecular systems with minimal additional effort.

In large-budget scenarios, directly employing the\nstandard GP model faces significant challenges in computational time and\nresource requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach,\ngradient-based sample selection Bayesian Optimization (GSSBO), to enhance the\ncomputational efficiency of BO. The GP model is constructed on a selected set\nof samples instead of the whole dataset. These samples are selected by\nleveraging gradient information to maintain diversity and representation. We\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the gradient-based sample selection strategy\nand obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for our proposed framework.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that our\napproach significantly reduces the computational cost of GP fitting in BO while\nmaintaining optimization performance comparable to baseline methods."}

The estimation leverages a neural net\nto recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial\ntrial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model\nthat is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator\non 12 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high\naccuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,\npretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible\nto researchers and practitioners."}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate a general formulation of sequential decision-making with stage-wise\nfeasibility constraints, where at each round, the learner must select an action\nbased on observed context while ensuring a problem-specific feasibility\ncriterion. We propose a unified algorithmic framework that captures many\nexisting constrained learning problems, including constrained bandits, stream\nactive learning, online hypothesis testing, and model calibration. Central to\nour approach is the concept of upper counterfactual confidence bound, which\nenables the design of practically efficient online algorithms using any offline\nconditional density estimation oracle. Technically, to handle feasibility\nconstraints, we introduce a generalized notion of the eluder dimension,\nextending it from the classical setting based on square loss to a broader class\nof metric-like probability divergences, which could capture the complexity of\nvarious density function classes and characterize the loss incurred due to\nfeasibility constraint uncertainty. Our result offers a principled foundation\nfor constrained sequential decision-making in both theory and practice."}

Specifically, various widespread\nmethodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led\nto an \\emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether\nthese problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce\nthe latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published\nat the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are\nconcerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through\nexperiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on\ndiffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon\nfootprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models.\nFurthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of\ndiffusion models and those of the traditional \\emph{top-n} recommendation task,\nraising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that,\nin the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are\nconstrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological\nissues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the\nresearch and publication culture in this area."}
