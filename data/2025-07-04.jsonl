This design is motivated by the dominant parameter\ncontribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the\nparameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have\nprimarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the\nFFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,\nexpressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a\nresidual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating\nentanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our\nexperiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia\nbenchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured\nQFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its\nclassical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific\nparameters by over 99%.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying\nanomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising\nsolution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.\nMoreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings."}

This study addresses this gap by benchmarking\nseven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and\nWav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These\ndatasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image\ndescriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and\nspontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and\ncharacter error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing\noptimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy\ndegradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error\nbehaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned\nWhisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription\nerrors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when\nencountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and\ntransparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures\nfor low-resource language (LRL) applications.

We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups.

We discuss why pretraining biases may cause\nLLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring\nscenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate\nthese biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling\nand bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and\ncaution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive\nfairness safeguards.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks.

The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform\nblocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard\ntransform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise\nfrequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent\nscaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant\nhigh-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model\ninter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse\nHT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention\nfor the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder\nConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying\nground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference,\nwe formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective,\npromoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field\nestimation.

This study proposes Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and\nrecognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly\ninputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of\nthorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model\n(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it\ncomes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).\nHence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis\nDetection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,\nDimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms\n(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on\ndatasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf\nscald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation\nmethod. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the\nutilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies\non different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between\nthe achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct\nImage-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results\nreveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis\nDetection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model\nfor detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop\nhealth, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and\nsustainability of rice farming."}

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

At the same time, recent advancements in\nself-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the\ncapabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to\nthe text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,\na new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning\nsteps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that\ncontains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We\ncontinuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and\ndemonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points\nin both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to\npre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised\nfine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that\nfull-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We\nshowcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the\nincrease in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.\nFinally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL\npipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy\nwith proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.\nRetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL\ntask and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented\nlanguage models."}

In this work, we study different NLP techniques to\nestablish the best ones to obtain competitive performances while keeping the\nneed for training annotated data to a minimum. To do so, we built the first\npublicly available multilingual dataset (French, English, and Spanish) for the\ntourism domain, composed of tourism-related tweets.

To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed\nto generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion\nprocess, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and\nexpressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying\nthe global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from\narbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse\nmakeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement\nModule into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality.

Results show that rule-based agents achieve\nnear-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability\n(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics.

A central LLM agent\norchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to\na distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and\n(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a\ndomain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and\nself-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic\ndesign that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This\nagent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language\njustifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing\ninterpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be\nsupported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.\nCyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing\nfinal classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.\nGenerated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based\nexpert evaluation.

As most\nexisting research on this topic has focused on English-language responses\nrelating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its\nfindings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to\nestablished methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different\nLLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using\nGerman data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate\nthe LLMs' performance by using human expert codings.

Our first set\nof results settles this by characterizing generation for existing notions of\nbreadth and their natural extensions.

Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed\nmanually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective.

Additionally, as\nendothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may\nnot fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed\ntubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture\nand maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired\nusing phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three\nindependent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics\nincluded tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel\ncircularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis\nmaturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image\ndiffered significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker\n(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count\n(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node\ncount (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across\nangiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,\nand circularity (all p<0.0001).

To better leverage information from\ntraining tasks, we introduce kernel density Bayesian inverse reinforcement\nlearning (KD-BIRL). Our approach employs a conditional kernel density\nestimator, which uses the known reward functions of the training tasks to\nimprove the likelihood estimation across a range of reward functions and\ndemonstration samples. Our empirical results highlight KD-BIRL's faster\nconcentration rate in comparison to baselines, particularly in low test task\nexpert demonstration data regimes. Additionally, we are the first to provide\ntheoretical guarantees of posterior concentration for a Bayesian IRL algorithm.\nTaken together, this work introduces a principled and theoretically grounded\nframework that enables Bayesian IRL to be applied across a variety of domains."}

While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown\npromise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key\nlimitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading\nto sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions from\ntraditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP), and require simulated\nenvironments to train in, which are impracticable to build for complex\nscheduling environments. We introduce Offline Learned Dispatching (Offline-LD),\nan offline reinforcement learning approach for JSSP, which addresses these\nlimitations by learning from historical scheduling data. Our approach is\nmotivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions\nare available or scenarios where online training of RL approaches with\nsimulated environments is impracticable. Offline-LD introduces maskable\nvariants of two Q-learning methods, namely, Maskable Quantile Regression DQN\n(mQRDQN) and discrete maskable Soft Actor-Critic (d-mSAC), that are able to\nlearn from historical data, through Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). Moreover, we\npresent a novel entropy bonus modification for d-mSAC, for maskable action\nspaces. Moreover, we introduce a novel reward normalization method for JSSP in\nan offline RL setting. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms\nonline RL on both generated and benchmark instances when trained on only 100\nsolutions generated by CP. Notably, introducing noise to the expert dataset\nyields comparable or superior results to using the expert dataset, with the\nsame amount of instances, a promising finding for real-world applications,\nwhere data is inherently noisy and imperfect."}

However, the privacy risks associated\nwith captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for\nidentity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While\ntraditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied\nto mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals\ncan still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper\nintroduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based\nreinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect\nsensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras.

Many of these tools\nwere initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and\ntherefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the\nutility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,\nhowever, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt\nto maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI. In this\npaper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call for\nmeaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and\nadaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the\ndifficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change\nthe ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed\nstructure of the generative AI value chain. In light of these distinctions,\npolicymakers will need to evaluate where the past decade of policy work remains\nrelevant and where new policies, designed to address the unique risks posed by\ngenerative AI, are necessary. We outline three recommendations for policymakers\nto more effectively identify regulatory targets and leverage constraints across\nthe broader ecosystem to govern generative AI."}

This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a\nstatic, initial context, creating a fundamental \"semantic gap\" between rich\nperceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends\nlanguage, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad.

This\nemerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as\nintermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive\ninput into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart\nthis evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive\nautonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool\nexploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks."}

Despite its\nadvancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from\nthe unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)\nand (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model\nquantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically\naddresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility\nunder both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.\nIn this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a\nprivacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different\nquantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously\nachieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error.

Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel\nProjector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens\nfrom ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches:\n``from central region to global\" and ``from abstract to specific\".

This compatibility, if it exists, raises a\nfundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of\nalignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?\nWe cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task\n- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual\ncoherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that\njointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of\npre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both\nreconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as\na method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure\nfrom disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design\naxes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its\nhard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at\nwhich alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model\nscale on representational convergence.

Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans.

Key words: prompt injection defense, LLM security,\n  LLM-integrated applications", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern\nsoftware systems, interfacing between the user and the Internet to assist with\ntasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks,\nthe LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval,\nresults from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to\nmanipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be injected\ninto external data sources to override the system's intended instruction and\ninstead execute a malicious instruction. To mitigate this vulnerability, we\npropose a new defense called SecAlign based on the technique of preference\noptimization. Our defense first constructs a preference dataset with\nprompt-injected inputs, secure outputs (ones that respond to the legitimate\ninstruction), and insecure outputs (ones that respond to the injection). We\nthen perform preference optimization on this dataset to teach the LLM to prefer\nthe secure output over the insecure one. This provides the first known method\nthat reduces the success rates of various prompt injections to <10%, even\nagainst attacks much more sophisticated than ones seen during training. This\nindicates our defense generalizes well against unknown and yet-to-come attacks.\nAlso, SecAlign models are still practical with similar utility to the one\nbefore defensive training in our evaluations.
