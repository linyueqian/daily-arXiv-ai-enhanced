With FairPlay, users can negotiate and arrive\nat a mutually acceptable outcome without a universally agreed-upon theory of\nfairness. In the absence of such a tool, reaching a consensus would be highly\nchallenging due to the lack of a systematic negotiation process and the\ninability to modify and observe changes. We have conducted user studies that\ndemonstrate the success of FairPlay, as users could reach a consensus within\nabout five rounds of gameplay, illustrating the application's potential for\nenhancing fairness in AI systems."}

This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to\nwork together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle\ncomplex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents\ncould change this.

Toward this end, we present two large-scale datasets of multi-modal\nand multi-categorical online harm: (1) 60,906 systematically selected\npotentially harmful YouTube videos and (2) 19,422 videos annotated by three\nlabeling actors: trained domain experts, GPT-4-Turbo (using 14 image frames, 1\nthumbnail, and text metadata), and crowdworkers (Amazon Mechanical Turk master\nworkers). The annotated dataset includes both (a) binary classification\n(harmful vs. harmless) and (b) multi-label categorizations of six harm\ncategories: Information, Hate and harassment, Addictive, Clickbait, Sexual, and\nPhysical harms. Furthermore, the annotated dataset provides (1) ground truth\ndata with videos annotated consistently across (a) all three actors and (b) the\nmajority of the labeling actors, and (2) three data subsets labeled by\nindividual actors. These datasets are expected to facilitate future work on\nonline harm, aid in (multi-modal) classification efforts, and advance the\nidentification and potential mitigation of harmful content on video platforms."}

The SCR helps maintain the geometric consistency between the\naircraft structure in SAR imagery and the proposed annotation.

International Organization\nfor Standardization (ISO) AI standards, such as ISO/IEC 24027 and 24368, aim to\nfoster responsible development by embedding fairness, transparency, and risk\nmanagement into AI systems. However, their effectiveness varies across diverse\nregulatory landscapes, from the EU's risk-based AI Act to China's\nstability-focused measures and the U.S.'s fragmented state-led initiatives.\nThis paper introduces a novel Comparative Risk-Impact Assessment Framework to\nevaluate how well ISO standards address ethical risks within these contexts,\nproposing enhancements to strengthen their global applicability. By mapping ISO\nstandards to the EU AI Act and surveying regulatory frameworks in ten\nregions-including the UK, Canada, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and\nBrazil-we establish a baseline for ethical alignment. The framework, applied to\ncase studies in the EU, US-Colorado, and China, reveals gaps: voluntary ISO\nstandards falter in enforcement (e.g., Colorado) and undervalue region-specific\nrisks like privacy (China). We recommend mandatory risk audits, region-specific\nannexes, and a privacy-focused module to enhance ISO's adaptability. This\napproach not only synthesizes global trends but also offers a replicable tool\nfor aligning standardization with ethical imperatives, fostering\ninteroperability and trust in AI worldwide.

Self-supervised representation learning methods\nsuch as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very\nsuccessful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image\ndata, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for\ndownstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information\nbetween related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every\nother data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch\nsizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance\nas they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to\nimplement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the\nstrength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called\nthe Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we\nconvert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise\ncomparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information\nformulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse. We call our new\nobjective the Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss. We test MINC by\nlearning image representations on ImageNet (similar to SimCLR and BYOL) and\nshow that it consistently improves upon the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline."}

DP2FL\ncombines global task awareness with local data-driven insights, enabling local\nmodels to achieve effective generalization while remaining adaptable to\nspecific data distributions. Moreover, DP2FL introduces a global model that\nenables prediction on new data sources and seamlessly integrates newly added\nclients without requiring retraining. Experimental results in highly\nheterogeneous environments validate the effectiveness of DP2FL's prompt design\nand aggregation strategy, underscoring the advantages of prediction on novel\ndata sources and demonstrating the seamless integration of new clients into the\nfederated learning framework."}

ML-MPC is advantageous for\nproviding safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within\npredefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability\nto changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the\npractical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires\nhigh variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose\nrisks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to\nmechanical damage. Conversely, ML-MPC relies on an accurate system model to\ngenerate optimal control inputs and has limited adaptability to system drifts,\nsuch as injector aging, which naturally occur in engine applications. To\naddress these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid RL and ML-MPC approach\nthat uses an ML-MPC framework while incorporating an RL agent to dynamically\nadjust the ML-MPC load tracking reference in response to changes in the\nenvironment. At the same time, the ML-MPC ensures that actions stay safe\nthroughout the RL agent's exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of this\napproach, fuel pressure is deliberately varied to introduce a model-plant\nmismatch between the ML-MPC and the engine test bench. The result of this\nmismatch is a root mean square error (RMSE) in indicated mean effective\npressure of 0.57 bar when running the ML-MPC. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that RL successfully adapts to changing boundary conditions by\naltering the tracking reference while ML-MPC ensures safe control inputs.

To generate more controllable and precise human\nmotions, we propose \\textbf{ProMoGen (Progressive Motion Generation)}, a novel\nframework that integrates trajectory guidance with sparse anchor motion\ncontrol. Global trajectories ensure consistency in spatial direction and\ndisplacement, while sparse anchor motions only deliver precise action guidance\nwithout displacement.

In this paper, we introduce MAYA, a unified, customizable,\nplug-and-play password benchmarking framework. MAYA provides a standardized\napproach for evaluating generative password-guessing models through a rigorous\nset of advanced testing scenarios and a collection of eight real-life password\ndatasets. Using MAYA, we comprehensively evaluate six state-of-the-art\napproaches, which have been re-implemented and adapted to ensure\nstandardization, for a total of over 15,000 hours of computation. Our findings\nindicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human\npassword distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities.

Moreover, we employ a\nprogressive training strategy consisting of three stages: an initial stage\nfocused on simple tasks with limited data to establish baseline consistency, a\nfull-scale training stage to comprehensively enhance the customization\ncapabilities, and a final quality alignment stage to correct quality biases\nintroduced by low-quality data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed DreamO can effectively perform various image customization tasks with\nhigh quality and flexibly integrate different types of control conditions."}

Recently, they have\nbeen shown to succumb to adversarial input attacks which make small\nimperceptible changes to the input image yet the hashing algorithm does not\ndetect its similarity to the original image. Property-preserving hashing (PPH)\nis a recent construct in cryptography, which preserves some property\n(predicate) of its inputs in the hash domain. Researchers have so far shown\nconstructions of PPH for Hamming distance predicates, which, for instance,\noutputs 1 if two inputs are within Hamming distance $t$. A key feature of PPH\nis its strong correctness guarantee, i.e., the probability that the predicate\nwill not be correctly evaluated in the hash domain is negligible. Motivated by\nthe use case of detecting similar images under adversarial setting, we propose\nthe first PPH construction for an $\\ell_1$-distance predicate. Roughly, this\npredicate checks if the two one-sided $\\ell_1$-distances between two images are\nwithin a threshold $t$. Since many adversarial attacks use $\\ell_2$-distance\n(related to $\\ell_1$-distance) as the objective function to perturb the input\nimage, by appropriately choosing the threshold $t$, we can force the attacker\nto add considerable noise to evade detection, and hence significantly\ndeteriorate the image quality.

For grayscale images of size $28 \\times 28$, we can\nevaluate the predicate in $0.0784$ seconds when pixel values are perturbed by\nup to $1 \\%$.

We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt\nOptimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by\nintegrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as\noperators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective\noptimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes\ninstructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for\nimproved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs\ndemonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization\nmethods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p.

For instance, if a jobs program benefits members\nof one city more than another, is that due to differences in program\nparticipants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given\ncovariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship\nbetween covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be\nmeaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear\nfunctional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates\nin one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these\nfunctional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not\nattribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given\ncovariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we\ndemonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions --\nfunctional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to\noutcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We\nprovide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a\ngeneral property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid\nmisattribution. We show that if the decomposition is independent of its input\ndistribution, it does not misattribute.

Majority of cameras use exposure fusion, which fuses images\ncaptured by different exposure levels, to increase dynamic range. However, this\napproach can only handle images with limited exposure difference, normally 3-4\nstops. When applying to very high dynamic range scenes where a large exposure\ndifference is required, this approach often fails due to incorrect alignment or\ninconsistent lighting between inputs, or tone mapping artifacts. In this work,\nwe propose \\model, the first exposure fusion technique that can merge inputs\nwith 9 stops differences. The key idea is that we model exposure fusion as a\nguided inpainting problem, where the under-exposed image is used as a guidance\nto fill the missing information of over-exposed highlights in the over-exposed\nregion. Using an under-exposed image as a soft guidance, instead of a hard\nconstraint, our model is robust to potential alignment issue or lighting\nvariations.

To address this, we propose\nthat effective MML representations should be causally sufficient and necessary.\nConsidering practical issues like spurious correlations and modality conflicts,\nwe relax the exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions prevalent in prior works\nand explore the concepts specific to MML, i.e., Causal Complete Cause\n(\\(C^3\\)). We begin by defining \\(C^3\\), which quantifies the probability of\nrepresentations being causally sufficient and necessary. We then discuss the\nidentifiability of \\(C^3\\) and introduce an instrumental variable to support\nidentifying \\(C^3\\) with non-exogeneity and non-monotonicity. Building on this,\nwe conduct the $C^3$ measurement, i.e., \\(C^3\\) risk. We propose a twin network\nto estimate it through (i) the real-world branch: utilizing the instrumental\nvariable for sufficiency, and (ii) the hypothetical-world branch: applying\ngradient-based counterfactual modeling for necessity.

To relax these\nlimitations, in this work, we introduce a novel framework that implicitly\nrepresents intervals through a hidden assignment matrix, enabling automatic\nparameter optimization via stochastic gradient descent. In this work, we\ndevelop a soft Mapper framework based on a Gaussian mixture model(GMM) for\nflexible and implicit interval construction. We further illustrate the\nrobustness of the soft Mapper algorithm by introducing the Mapper graph mode as\na point estimation for the output graph. Moreover, a stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm with a specific topological loss function is proposed for\noptimizing parameters in the model. Both simulation and application studies\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the underlying topological\nstructures. In addition, the application to an RNA expression dataset obtained\nfrom the Mount Sinai/JJ Peters VA Medical Center Brain Bank (MSBB) successfully\nidentifies a distinct subgroup of Alzheimer's Disease."}

Although transfer learning from ImageNet is a widely\nadopted strategy, its effectiveness is constrained by the substantial\ndifferences between natural and medical images. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Medical Neural Network Search (MedNNS), the first Neural Network\nSearch framework for medical imaging applications.

MMSB provides quite a\ngeneral setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The\ncentral question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities\ngiven an observed network. We compare different approaches and establish the\nminimax lower bound on the estimation error. Then, we propose a new estimator\nthat matches this lower bound. Theoretical results are proved under fairly\ngeneral conditions on the considered model. Finally, we illustrate the theory\nin a series of experiments."}

However,\ntoday's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require\ncomputationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from\nsimilar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a\npioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the\nframework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the\nneurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and\nreact quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with\nconnection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of\nphysics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling\nevolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of\nphysics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of\nthose tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved\nBaldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities\nacross a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an\norder of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the\ncomputation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning\nmethods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x\nimprovement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time.\nThis paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as\ngeneralizable physics solvers.

We call a function \"vulnerable\" if it was involved\nin a patch of an actual security flaw and confirmed to cause the program's\nvulnerability. It is \"non-vulnerable\" otherwise.

Even well-trained machine\nlearning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between\ntraining data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In\nparticular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g.,\nstraight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic\ncircles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such\nas sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to\ndetect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging\nthe intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar\nto training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a\nprincipled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a\nchange-point detection problem.

We show that\nthis method is biased whenever the RSV is post-outcome, i.e. if variation in\nthe economic outcome causes variation in the RSV. In program evaluation,\nchanges in poverty or environmental quality cause changes in satellite images,\nbut not vice versa. As our main result, we nonparametrically identify the\ntreatment effect by formalizing the intuition that underlies common practice:\nthe conditional distribution of the RSV given the outcome and treatment is\nstable across the samples.Based on our identifying formula, we find that the\nefficient representation of RSVs for causal inference requires three\npredictions rather than one.
