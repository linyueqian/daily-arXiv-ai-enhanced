### [2] [Rethinking LLM Training through Information Geometry and Quantum Metrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15830)
*Riccardo Di Sipio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores optimization in large language models (LLMs) using information geometry and natural gradient descent, highlighting its theoretical benefits and practical challenges. It also speculates on quantum analogies for efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve optimization in LLMs by leveraging geometric insights from information geometry, despite practical limitations.

Method: Uses the Fisher information metric and natural gradient descent to analyze the high-dimensional, non-Euclidean parameter space of LLMs.

Result: The geometric perspective clarifies phenomena like sharp minima, generalization, and scaling laws in LLMs.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware approaches enhance LLM training understanding, with potential quantum analogies offering future optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient
optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

### [3] [MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15841)
*Zijian Zhou, Ao Qu, Zhaoxuan Wu, Sunghwan Kim, Alok Prakash, Daniela Rus, Jinhua Zhao, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEM1 is a reinforcement learning framework for language agents, enabling constant memory usage in long multi-turn tasks by consolidating and discarding irrelevant information. It outperforms larger models in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems suffer from unbounded memory growth and degraded performance due to full-context prompting, necessitating a scalable solution for long-horizon tasks.

Method: MEM1 uses reinforcement learning to update a compact internal state, integrating prior memory with new observations while discarding redundancy. Training involves composing datasets into complex task sequences.

Result: MEM1-7B improves performance by 3.5x and reduces memory usage by 3.7x compared to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, generalizing beyond training horizons.

Conclusion: MEM1 demonstrates the effectiveness of reasoning-driven memory consolidation for scalable, efficient long-horizon interactive agents.

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

### [4] [Finance Language Model Evaluation (FLaME)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15846)
*Glenn Matlin, Mika Okamoto, Huzaifa Pardawala, Yang Yang, Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLaME, a benchmarking suite to evaluate Language Models (LMs) on specialized finance NLP tasks, addressing gaps in existing frameworks and demonstrating LMs' potential in finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for LMs in finance have methodological gaps, leading to underestimation of their performance. The paper aims to correct this by providing a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: The authors develop FLaME, a holistic benchmarking suite, and empirically evaluate 23 foundation LMs on 20 core NLP tasks in finance, comparing standard LMs with 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs.

Result: The study reveals the potential of LMs in finance, challenging the belief of their limited performance. The framework, data, and results are open-sourced.

Conclusion: FLaME provides a robust evaluation tool for LMs in finance, highlighting their underestimated capabilities and encouraging further research in FinNLP.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities with core
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The effectiveness of LMs for highly
specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess
due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which
have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs' performance on
common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for
these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for
Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to
comprehensively study LMs against 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs, with an empirical
study of 23 foundation LMs over 20 core NLP tasks in finance. We open-source
our framework software along with all data and results.

### [5] [Entropy-Driven Pre-Tokenization for Byte-Pair Encoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15889)
*Yifan Hu, Frank Liang, Dachuan Zhao, Jonathan Geuter, Varshini Reddy, Craig W. Schmidt, Chris Tanner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies to improve BPE for unsegmented languages like Chinese, showing better segmentation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE's frequency-driven merges struggle with unsegmented languages like Chinese due to lack of linguistic boundary awareness.

Method: Two strategies: (1) pointwise mutual info and entropy for coherent spans, (2) GPT-2 predictive entropy for boundary uncertainty.

Result: Substantial improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score on PKU dataset compared to standard BPE.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided pre-tokenization aligns better with linguistic units and improves tokenization, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) has become a widely adopted subword tokenization
method in modern language models due to its simplicity and strong empirical
performance across downstream tasks. However, applying BPE to unsegmented
languages such as Chinese presents significant challenges, as its
frequency-driven merge operation is agnostic to linguistic boundaries. To
address this, we propose two entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies that
guide BPE segmentation using unsupervised information-theoretic cues. The first
approach uses pointwise mutual information and left/right entropy to identify
coherent character spans, while the second leverages predictive entropy derived
from a pretrained GPT-2 model to detect boundary uncertainty. We evaluate both
methods on a subset of the PKU dataset and demonstrate substantial improvements
in segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score compared to standard BPE. Our
results suggest that entropy-guided pre-tokenization not only enhances
alignment with gold-standard linguistic units but also offers a promising
direction for improving tokenization quality in low-resource and multilingual
settings.

### [6] [GeoGuess: Multimodal Reasoning based on Hierarchy of Visual Information in Street View](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16633)
*Fenghua Cheng, Jinxiang Wang, Sen Wang, Zi Huang, Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoGuess, a novel multimodal reasoning task involving location identification and explanation from street view images, and presents the SightSense method for hierarchical visual and geographic knowledge reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning tasks lack focus on hierarchical visual clues (local details and global context), which are crucial in real-world scenarios. GeoGuess addresses this gap.

Method: The authors propose SightSense, a multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, and introduce the GeoExplain dataset (panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples) for benchmarking.

Result: SightSense demonstrates outstanding performance in GeoGuess, effectively reasoning across hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge.

Conclusion: GeoGuess and SightSense advance multimodal reasoning by addressing hierarchical visual clues and integrating geographic knowledge, setting a new benchmark for AI.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring
information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging
academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although
there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still
have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different
levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little
discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely
GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and
provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be
able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate
with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability
to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In
this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially
curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of
panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a
multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make
prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual
information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate
their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.

### [7] [Language Models can perform Single-Utterance Self-Correction of Perturbed Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15894)
*Sam Silver, Jimin Sun, Ivan Zhang, Sara Hooker, Eddie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show robust self-correction in reasoning, even without fine-tuning, suggesting intrinsic capabilities beyond current literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' self-correction abilities in mathematical reasoning, especially under synthetic perturbations.

Method: Experiments measuring models' self-correction of synthetic perturbations in Chain of Thought reasoning.

Result: Models exhibit strong intrinsic self-correction, from subtle to explicit error corrections.

Conclusion: LLMs may have stronger intrinsic self-correction than previously thought, indicating reasoning work amplifies existing traits.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive mathematical
reasoning capabilities, yet their performance remains brittle to minor
variations in problem description and prompting strategy. Furthermore,
reasoning is vulnerable to sampling-induced errors which autoregressive models
must primarily address using self-correction via additionally-generated tokens.
To better understand self-correction capabilities of recent models, we conduct
experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations
introduced into their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. We observe robust
single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior across a range of
open-weight models and datasets, ranging from subtle, implicit corrections to
explicit acknowledgments and corrections of errors. Our findings suggest that
LLMs, including those not finetuned for long CoT, may possess stronger
intrinsic self-correction capabilities than commonly shown in the literature.
The presence of this ability suggests that recent "reasoning" model work
involves amplification of traits already meaningfully present in models.

### [8] [From RAG to Agentic: Validating Islamic-Medicine Responses with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15911)
*Mohammad Amaan Sayeed, Mohammed Talha Alam, Raza Imam, Shahab Saquib Sohail, Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tibbe-AG, a pipeline to evaluate LLMs on culturally grounded Islamic medical texts, showing retrieval and self-critique improve accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in modern AI systems by leveraging classical Islamic medical texts for culturally sensitive medical guidance.

Method: A unified evaluation pipeline (Tibbe-AG) tests three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a scientific self-critique filter.

Result: Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, and the agentic prompt adds another 10% improvement. The pipeline enables reliable, culturally sensitive medical QA.

Conclusion: Combining classical Islamic texts with retrieval and self-evaluation enhances AI's ability to provide culturally grounded medical guidance.

Abstract: Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the
Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and
holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern
AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall
or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical
guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that
aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified
remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three
configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a
scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary
LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score.
Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds
another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety
considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts
with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive
medical question-answering.

### [9] [Reranking-based Generation for Unbiased Perspective Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15925)
*Narutatsu Ri, Nicholas Deas, Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses gaps in evaluating and improving unbiased summaries in political perspective summarization using LLMs, proposing reliable metrics and demonstrating the effectiveness of reranking and preference tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for unbiased summaries in political perspective summarization lack reliable metrics, and improved summarization methods are underdeveloped.

Method: The study identifies reliable metrics using human annotations, compares traditional and language model-based metrics, and evaluates reranking and preference tuning methods with synthetic data.

Result: Language model-based metrics outperform traditional ones, and reranking-based methods with preference tuning show improved performance.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to better evaluation and development of perspective summarization methods, emphasizing the effectiveness of advanced LLM-based techniques.

Abstract: Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political
perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics
for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without
verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are
still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for
measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of
LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for
benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that
traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,
which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that
reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with
synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.
Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of
perspective summarization methods.

TL;DR: VSMRC is a dataset for Vietnamese text segmentation and MRC, sourced from Wikipedia, with experiments showing mBERT outperforms monolingual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vietnamese lacks robust NLP resources, prompting the creation of VSMRC to address this gap.

Method: The dataset includes 15,942 documents for segmentation and 16,347 synthetic QA pairs, with human quality assurance.

Result: mBERT achieved 88.01% accuracy on MRC and 63.15% F1 on segmentation, outperforming monolingual models.

Conclusion: Multilingual models like mBERT excel in Vietnamese NLP, suggesting broader applications for under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Vietnamese, the 20th most spoken language with over 102 million native
speakers, lacks robust resources for key natural language processing tasks such
as text segmentation and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address this
gap, we present VSMRC, the Vietnamese Text Segmentation and Multiple-Choice
Reading Comprehension Dataset. Sourced from Vietnamese Wikipedia, our dataset
includes 15,942 documents for text segmentation and 16,347 synthetic
multiple-choice question-answer pairs generated with human quality assurance,
ensuring a reliable and diverse resource. Experiments show that mBERT
consistently outperforms monolingual models on both tasks, achieving an
accuracy of 88.01% on MRC test set and an F1 score of 63.15\% on text
segmentation test set. Our analysis reveals that multilingual models excel in
NLP tasks for Vietnamese, suggesting potential applications to other
under-resourced languages. VSMRC is available at HuggingFace

### [11] [Double Entendre: Robust Audio-Based AI-Generated Lyrics Detection via Multi-View Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15981)
*Markus Frohmann, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, Markus Schedl, Elena V. Epure*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DE-detect, a multimodal method combining transcribed lyrics and speech features from audio to detect AI-generated music, outperforming existing detectors in robustness and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated music challenges artists and copyright holders, requiring reliable detection methods. Current detectors (audio or lyrics-based) have limitations in generalization and practicality.

Method: A multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline integrates transcribed sung lyrics and speech features from audio to detect AI-generated content.

Result: DE-detect outperforms lyrics-based detectors and is more robust to audio perturbations.

Conclusion: DE-detect provides an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing
the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders,
and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such
AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or
lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to
generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio
perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate
lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion
pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech
features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on
lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates
susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.
Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based
detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers
an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world
scenarios. Our code is available at

### [12] [From General to Targeted Rewards: Surpassing GPT-4 in Open-Ended Long-Context Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16024)
*Zhihan Guo, Jiele Wu, Wenqian Cui, Yifei Zhang, Minda Hu, Yufei Wang, Irwin King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProxyReward, a new RL framework, improves Open-LTG tasks by generating datasets and reward signals without extensive labeled data, outperforming GPT-4-Turbo and LLM-as-a-Judge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended Long Text Generation (Open-LTG) lacks exploration, and existing methods rely on general assessments, limiting accuracy.

Method: ProxyReward uses simple prompts for dataset generation and provides targeted reward signals for information comprehensiveness and accuracy.

Result: ProxyReward outperforms GPT-4-Turbo and enhances Open-LTG performance by 20% for open-source models.

Conclusion: ProxyReward effectively improves LLMs' ability to handle complex open-ended questions.

Abstract: Current research on long-form context in Large Language Models (LLMs)
primarily focuses on the understanding of long-contexts, the Open-ended Long
Text Generation (Open-LTG) remains insufficiently explored. Training a
long-context generation model requires curation of gold standard reference
data, which is typically nonexistent for informative Open-LTG tasks. However,
previous methods only utilize general assessments as reward signals, which
limits accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProxyReward, an innovative
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, which includes a dataset and a
reward signal computation method. Firstly, ProxyReward Dataset generation is
accomplished through simple prompts that enables the model to create
automatically, obviating extensive labeled data or significant manual effort.
Secondly, ProxyReward Signal offers a targeted evaluation of information
comprehensiveness and accuracy for specific questions. The experimental results
indicate that our method ProxyReward surpasses even GPT-4-Turbo. It can
significantly enhance performance by 20% on the Open-LTG task when training
widely used open-source models, while also surpassing the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach. Our work presents effective methods to enhance the ability of LLMs to
address complex open-ended questions posed by human.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using weakly labeled data to build speech-to-text translation models for low-resource languages, achieving performance comparable to strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scarce high-quality annotated data for low-resource speech-to-text translation.

Method: Constructed datasets using bitext mining from the Shrutilipi corpus, creating varied-quality training data for Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi, Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi pairs.

Result: ST systems built with weakly labeled data perform comparably to models like SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

Conclusion: Weakly labeled data is viable for building effective ST systems for low-resource languages.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge
in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems,
particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis
that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource
language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the
help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the
multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset
comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi,
Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data
with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of
quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results
demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with
performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as
SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating design choices in multi-stage LM training and provide transparency in training dynamics.

Method: Train over 100 LMs (1B and 4B parameters) from scratch, evaluating upstream and downstream capabilities, including generalization.

Result: Key findings include diminishing returns from excessive training, the role of continued pre-training, and trade-offs in fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: EvoLM offers insights into LM training dynamics and releases all models, datasets, and pipelines for open research.

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages,
making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design
choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables
systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across
pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we
rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream
(problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the
diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the
importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific
continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging
pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when
configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate
open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained
models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and
evaluation pipeline.

### [15] [Advancing Automated Speaking Assessment Leveraging Multifaceted Relevance and Grammar Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16285)
*Hao-Chien Lu, Jhen-Ke Lin, Hong-Yun Lin, Chung-Chun Wang, Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid scoring model for automated speaking assessment (ASA) with two enhancements: a multifaceted relevance module and fine-grained grammar error features, improving content relevance and language use evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASA systems lack comprehensive content relevance analysis and detailed grammar error identification, limiting their effectiveness in multi-aspect evaluations.

Method: The proposed hybrid model includes a relevance module integrating question, image, exemplar, and spoken response, and fine-grained grammar error features derived from GEC and annotation.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in evaluating content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance.

Conclusion: Richer, nuanced feature sets enhance holistic speaking assessment, addressing prior deficiencies in ASA systems.

Abstract: Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect
evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image
or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed
error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel
enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted
relevance module integrates question and the associated image content,
exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment
of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived
using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to
identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of
content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the
benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking
assessment.

Built upon LLaMA 3, the framework integrates a dense retrieval module with
advanced context fusion and multi-hop reasoning mechanisms, enabling more
accurate and coherent response generation. A joint optimization strategy
combining retrieval likelihood and generation cross-entropy improves the
model's robustness and adaptability. Experimental results show that the

Result: Evaluation reveals significant room for improvement in current instruction-following TTS systems.

Conclusion: InstructTTSEval aims to advance the development of more flexible and accurate instruction-driven TTS models.

Abstract: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's
vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in
conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control
these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ
natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features,
substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models.
Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual
description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions
remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of
high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed
for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative
optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce
InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex
natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely
Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play,
including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total)
paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess
their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible
instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further
improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more
powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.

*Fei Wang, Xingchen Wan, Ruoxi Sun, Jiefeng Chen, Sercan √ñ. Arƒ±k*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynScaling improves LLM performance under resource constraints by integrating parallel-sequential sampling and dynamic budget allocation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of inference-time scaling, such as reliance on external verifiers and lack of optimization for computational constraints.

Method: Integrated parallel-sequential sampling and bandit-based dynamic budget allocation.

Result: DynScaling surpasses verifier-free baselines in performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DynScaling is a practical and efficient solution for enhancing LLM performance without external verifiers.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model
(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical
application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of
optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,
which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an
integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic
budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel
and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains
from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent
reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the
allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,
adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the
uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational
efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM
performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external
verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently
surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task
performance and computational cost.

*Dana Serditova, Kevin Tang, Jochen Steffens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASR systems perform poorly on regional dialects like Newcastle English due to biased training. This study identifies dialectal features as the main cause of errors, advocating for more diverse training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexamined issue of regional bias in ASR systems, focusing on Newcastle English, a challenging dialect.

Method: A two-stage analysis: manual error analysis of phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors, followed by a case study on regional pronouns.

Result: ASR errors correlate with dialectal features; social factors have minimal impact.

Conclusion: Greater dialectal diversity in training data and sociolinguistic analysis are needed to mitigate regional biases.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects
due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous
research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias
remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle
English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A
two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample
identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR
misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR
recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that
ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social
factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal
diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic
analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.

*Enes Yavuz Ugan, Ngoc-Quan Pham, Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A continual learning approach for neural speech recognition models prevents catastrophic forgetting using factorization and centralization phases, inspired by human brain learning cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable neural networks to absorb new data without re-training, avoiding catastrophic forgetting in rehearsal-free, multilingual settings.

Method: Proposes a two-phase approach: factorization for learning and centralization for merging knowledge, using low-rank adapters.

Result: Effective prevention of catastrophic forgetting in experiments with varied code-switching datasets.

Conclusion: The centralization phase successfully accumulates knowledge, maintaining model quality without re-training.

Abstract: Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to
continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in
downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the
original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,
multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic
forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can
destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human
brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we
propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization
and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments
on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization
stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the
knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.

### [21] [A Hybrid DeBERTa and Gated Broad Learning System for Cyberbullying Detection in English Text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16052)
*Devesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining DeBERTa and GBLS for cyberbullying detection achieves high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the rising issue of cyberbullying by improving detection methods using advanced AI techniques.

Method: Combines a modified DeBERTa model with sentiment analysis and a GBLS classifier for enhanced detection.

Result: Achieves high accuracy (79.3%-95.41%) across four datasets and includes explainability features.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and transparent, though challenges remain in detecting implicit bias and sarcasm.

Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented
opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful
behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of
teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid
architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of
transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad
learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach
integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation
blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System
(GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing
approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa +
GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy
on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and
94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework
incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level
attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence
calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content
moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each
architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific
challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable
insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

TL;DR: A streaming accent conversion model transforms non-native speech into native-like accents while preserving speaker identity and prosody, using an Emformer encoder and optimized inference for real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time accent conversion while maintaining speaker identity and prosody, addressing the lack of streaming-capable AC systems.

Method: Modifies a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and optimized inference, integrating a native TTS model for training data.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to top AC models with stable latency, enabling the first streaming AC system.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully enables real-time accent conversion with preserved speaker identity and prosody, marking a milestone in streaming AC.

Abstract: We propose a first streaming accent conversion (AC) model that transforms
non-native speech into a native-like accent while preserving speaker identity,
prosody and improving pronunciation. Our approach enables stream processing by
modifying a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and an optimized
inference mechanism. Additionally, we integrate a native text-to-speech (TTS)
model to generate ideal ground-truth data for efficient training. Our streaming
AC model achieves comparable performance to the top AC models while maintaining
stable latency, making it the first AC system capable of streaming.

*Daejin Jo, Jeeyoung Yun, Byungseok Roh, Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM-SPT introduces a novel semantic distillation method for speech tokenization, improving alignment with language models and supporting multiple frame rates, outperforming baselines in speech-to-text and text-to-speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of speech token sequences being longer than textual ones, which complicates efficient speech-language modeling, by improving semantic alignment and reducing frame rate without distorting semantic structure.

Method: Proposes LM-SPT, which reconstructs speech from semantic tokens and minimizes discrepancy between original and reconstructed waveforms using a frozen ASR encoder, alongside architectural improvements for tokenization.

Result: LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity and enables SLMs to perform competitively in speech-to-text and outperform baselines in text-to-speech tasks.

Conclusion: LM-SPT effectively bridges the gap between speech and text modalities by enhancing semantic alignment and supporting flexible frame rates, demonstrating practical improvements in SLM performance.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech
tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling
unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim
to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with
language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as
HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a
semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture
content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token
sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating
challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a
natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across
frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM
alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method
that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching
teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from
semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded
representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a
frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet
data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are
more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates
architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,
and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.
Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity
compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve
competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform
baselines on text-to-speech tasks.

*Andy Yang, Micha√´l Cadilhac, David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the expressive capabilities of deeper transformers, proving their equivalence to C-RASP programs and showing deeper models are more expressive. Empirical evidence supports the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally establish which capabilities are gained with greater depth in transformers, addressing the gap in understanding depth's role in expressiveness.

Method: Theoretical proof and empirical study: (1) Equate transformers to C-RASP programs, preserving depth; (2) Prove deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive; (3) Validate with empirical tasks.

Result: Deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower ones within the studied subclass. Empirical results align with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Depth in transformers enhances expressiveness, as proven theoretically and supported empirically, particularly in sequential dependency tasks.

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more
layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which
capabilities are gained with greater depth? We answer this question with a
theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider
transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show
that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the
programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we
prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP
programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower
transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). These results are
established by studying a form of temporal logic with counting operators, which
was shown equivalent to C-RASP in previous work. Finally, we provide empirical
evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without
positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency
tasks.

*Duc Hieu Ho, Chenglin Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of improving honesty and helpfulness in LLM outputs by proposing a self-critique-guided prompting strategy and benchmarking ten models, showing consistent improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' capabilities, ensuring honest and helpful outputs remains a challenge. This paper aims to enhance trustworthiness without additional training.

Method: A novel prompting strategy, self-critique-guided curiosity refinement, is introduced, involving self-critique and refinement steps. Ten LLMs are benchmarked.

Result: Experiments on the HONESET dataset show improved H¬≤ scores (1.4% to 4.3%), fewer poor-quality responses, and more high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: Structured self-refinement is an effective, scalable, and training-free method to enhance LLM trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across
various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are
consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this
challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.
It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large
language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,
Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,
self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this
strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without
additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting
strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including
self-critique step and refinement step.
  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework
$\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a
judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all
models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases
high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores
ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across
evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured
self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the
trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a MURIL-based framework for detecting cyberbullying in Hinglish text, outperforming existing models and incorporating explainability features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of code-mixed Hinglish communication on digital platforms highlights the limitations of monolingual cyberbullying detection systems, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: The framework uses the MURIL architecture, with selective layer freezing, tailored classification heads, and preprocessing for code-mixed text.

Result: The MURIL-based approach outperforms RoBERTa and IndicBERT, achieving accuracies ranging from 75.41% to 94.63% across six datasets.

Conclusion: The framework addresses key challenges in multilingual cyberbullying detection, with future research directions identified for context, culture, and sarcasm.

Abstract: The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased
cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection
systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish)
communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying
detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This
paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using
the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to
address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark
datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et
al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based
approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and
IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies
of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\%
on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The
framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and
cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective
layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized
preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while
failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent
interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection,
providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinCoT introduces structured CoT prompting for financial reasoning, improving model performance and reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior FinNLP work lacks domain-specific structured CoT prompting, relying on heuristics from non-experts.

Method: Evaluates three prompting styles (standard, unstructured CoT, structured CoT) and FinCoT on CFA-style questions.

Result: FinCoT boosts performance (63.2% to 80.5%) and reduces tokens eight-fold compared to structured CoT.

Conclusion: Domain-aligned structured prompts enhance performance, cost-efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
approach that incorporates insights from domain-specific expert financial
reasoning to guide the reasoning traces of large language models. We
investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard
prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an
explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT
prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define
structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt
engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,
structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.
Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is
often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we
investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main
prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial
domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens
eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that
domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce
inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning
traces.

*Chenxi Wang, Yixuan Zhang, Lang Gao, Zixiang Xu, Zirui Song, Yanbo Wang, Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs internalize language-specific reasoning biases, as shown by attention patterns and performance on a bilingual causal reasoning dataset (BICAUSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if LLMs internalize habitual logical structures from language, inspired by linguistic relativity.

Method: Used BICAUSE, a bilingual dataset with aligned Chinese and English causal samples, to analyze LLM attention and reasoning patterns.

Result: LLMs show language-specific attention and reasoning biases, with degraded performance on atypical inputs, but converge on shared semantic abstractions when reasoning succeeds.

Conclusion: LLMs mimic and internalize language-shaped reasoning biases, empirically verified through structural analysis.

Abstract: Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human
cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure
of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)
trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures
embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce
BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes
semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed
causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit
typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and
sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced
distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences
for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading
to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning
succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned
abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface
form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface
linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.
Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time
empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGIC, a Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework, to improve LLM calibration by using uncertainty scores for document relevance and response confidence, enhancing multi-round calibration and response accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods often overlook LLMs' calibration capabilities, despite their strong in-context reasoning. This work addresses this gap by leveraging specific cues to improve calibration.

Method: The SGIC framework uses uncertainty scores to assess document relevance and LLM response confidence, iteratively refining calibration. It also introduces a method to create a self-calibration training set for optimizing LLMs.

Result: The framework significantly boosts performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: SGIC effectively enhances LLM calibration and response accuracy by integrating uncertainty scores and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on
retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous
methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.
This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially
improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We
present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs
uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty
scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the
confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it
reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to
refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for
constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs
to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information
and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves
performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Motivation: To automate the summarization of lengthy radiology findings into concise impressions, aiding medical professionals.

Method: Comparative analysis of pre-trained models (T5-base, BART-base, PEGASUS-x-base, ChatGPT-4, LLaMA-3-8B) and a custom Pointer Generator Network with coverage, evaluated using ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore.

Result: Identifies strengths and limitations of each model in medical text summarization.

Conclusion: Provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals seeking automated summarization solutions.

Abstract: The findings section of a radiology report is often detailed and lengthy,
whereas the impression section is comparatively more compact and captures key
diagnostic conclusions. This research explores the use of advanced abstractive
summarization models to generate the concise impression from the findings
section of a radiology report. We have used the publicly available MIMIC-CXR

their respective strengths and limitations in the summarization of medical
text. The findings of this paper provide helpful information for medical

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark dataset for LLM safety in Polish is introduced, with adversarial samples. Three models are evaluated, with the HerBERT-based classifier performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety assessments for LLMs are biased toward high-resource languages, leaving others like Polish underexamined.

Method: A manually annotated benchmark dataset for Polish is created, along with adversarial variants. Three models (Llama-Guard-3-8B, HerBERT-based classifier, PLLuM) are fine-tuned and evaluated.

Result: The HerBERT-based classifier achieves the highest performance, especially under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for multilingual safety assessments and demonstrates the effectiveness of a Polish-specific classifier.

Abstract: Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models
(LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily
biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of
global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually
annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish.
We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to
challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures.
Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based
classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B
model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and
evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard
models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the

TL;DR: UrbanCIA is an LLM-driven framework for urban causal research, addressing inefficiencies in hypothesis formulation, data integration, and methodology. It proposes modular agents for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design, and policy insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban causal research faces challenges like biased hypothesis formulation, data integration issues, and fragile methodologies, limiting its effectiveness for policy-making.

Method: UrbanCIA uses four modular agents: hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design/execution, and results interpretation. It leverages LLMs for scalable, reproducible research.

Result: The framework aims to improve rigor, transparency, and inclusivity in urban research, enabling better policy insights and actionable recommendations.

Conclusion: UrbanCIA advocates for LLM-driven tools to enhance urban research scalability, reproducibility, and equity, calling for a new research agenda.

Abstract: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex, dynamic
processes that shape cities and for informing evidence-based policies. However,
current practices are often constrained by inefficient and biased hypothesis
formulation, challenges in integrating multimodal data, and fragile
experimental methodologies. Imagine a system that automatically estimates the
causal impact of congestion pricing on commute times by income group or
measures how new green spaces affect asthma rates across neighborhoods using
satellite imagery and health reports, and then generates comprehensive,
policy-ready outputs, including causal estimates, subgroup analyses, and
actionable recommendations. In this Perspective, we propose UrbanCIA, an
LLM-driven conceptual framework composed of four distinct modular agents
responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and
execution, and results interpretation with policy insights. We begin by
examining the current landscape of urban causal research through a structured
taxonomy of research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches,
revealing systemic limitations across the workflow. Next, we introduce the
design principles and technological roadmap for the four modules in the
proposed framework. We also propose evaluation criteria to assess the rigor and
transparency of these AI-augmented processes. Finally, we reflect on the
broader implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We
call for a new research agenda that embraces LLM-driven tools as catalysts for
more scalable, reproducible, and inclusive urban research.

*Agnese Daffara, Sourabh Dattawad, Sebastian Pad√≥, Tanise Ceron*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the applicability of the Media Frame Corpus (MFC) to Brazilian Portuguese news, finding it broadly applicable but requiring minor adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if MFC frames generalize to non-U.S. cultural contexts, specifically Brazilian news.

Method: Introduce FrameNews-PT, annotate Brazilian news using MFC, and evaluate frame generalization and model performance.

Result: MFC frames are broadly applicable but need minor guideline revisions; some frames are rarely used.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural frame use requires careful consideration due to variations in frame applicability.

Abstract: Frames capture aspects of an issue that are emphasized in a debate by
interlocutors and can help us understand how political language conveys
different perspectives and ultimately shapes people's opinions. The Media Frame
Corpus (MFC) is the most commonly used framework with categories and detailed
guidelines for operationalizing frames. It is, however, focused on a few
salient U.S. news issues, making it unclear how well these frames can capture
news issues in other cultural contexts. To explore this, we introduce
FrameNews-PT, a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese news articles covering
political and economic news and annotate it within the MFC framework. Through
several annotation rounds, we evaluate the extent to which MFC frames
generalize to the Brazilian debate issues. We further evaluate how fine-tuned
and zero-shot models perform on out-of-domain data. Results show that the 15
MFC frames remain broadly applicable with minor revisions of the guidelines.
However, some MFC frames are rarely used, and novel news issues are analyzed
using general 'fall-back' frames. We conclude that cross-cultural frame use
requires careful consideration.

TL;DR: Incorporating knowledge graph information improves relation extraction model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets, using graph-aware features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if entity positions in knowledge graphs enhance relation extraction tasks.

Method: Combined established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford networks, tested in supervised and zero-shot settings.

Result: Significant performance improvements, particularly with imbalanced training examples.

Conclusion: Knowledge graph integration boosts relation extraction effectiveness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We examine the impact of incorporating knowledge graph information on the
performance of relation extraction models across a range of datasets. Our
hypothesis is that the positions of entities within a knowledge graph provide
important insights for relation extraction tasks. We conduct experiments on
multiple datasets, each varying in the number of relations, training examples,
and underlying knowledge graphs. Our results demonstrate that integrating
knowledge graph information significantly enhances performance, especially when
dealing with an imbalance in the number of training examples for each relation.
We evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph-based features by combining
established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford
networks. These features are tested in both supervised and zero-shot settings,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various datasets.

*Cedric M√∂ller, Ricardo Usbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A discriminative method for closed information extraction improves accuracy, especially for long-tail relations, outperforming generative models and emphasizing efficiency with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance relation extraction accuracy, particularly for long-tail relations, and address the challenge of large-scale closed information extraction with millions of entities and hundreds of relations.

Method: Employs a discriminative approach incorporating type and entity-specific information, leveraging smaller models for efficiency.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art generative models, achieving comparable or better results with smaller models.

Conclusion: The method promises more accurate and efficient information extraction, especially for large-scale applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for closed information extraction. The
method employs a discriminative approach that incorporates type and
entity-specific information to improve relation extraction accuracy,
particularly benefiting long-tail relations. Notably, this method demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end generative models.
This is especially evident for the problem of large-scale closed information
extraction where we are confronted with millions of entities and hundreds of
relations. Furthermore, we emphasize the efficiency aspect by leveraging
smaller models. In particular, the integration of type-information proves
instrumental in achieving performance levels on par with or surpassing those of
a larger generative model. This advancement holds promise for more accurate and
efficient information extraction techniques.

### [38] [Can structural correspondences ground real world representational content in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16370)
*Iwan Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs like GPT-4 can represent real-world entities, concluding that structural correspondences alone are insufficient unless they explain task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainties about LLMs' representational capacities, especially given their text-only inputs and outputs.

Method: Uses a structural-correspondence based account to evaluate LLMs' representation of worldly entities.

Result: Structural correspondences alone don't ground representation; they must explain task performance to do so.

Conclusion: LLMs could represent real-world contents if structural correspondences are exploited for task success, despite text-boundedness challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 produce compelling responses to a
wide range of prompts. But their representational capacities are uncertain.
Many LLMs have no direct contact with extra-linguistic reality: their inputs,
outputs and training data consist solely of text, raising the questions (1) can
LLMs represent anything and (2) if so, what? In this paper, I explore what it
would take to answer these questions according to a structural-correspondence
based account of representation, and make an initial survey of this evidence. I
argue that the mere existence of structural correspondences between LLMs and
worldly entities is insufficient to ground representation of those entities.
However, if these structural correspondences play an appropriate role - they
are exploited in a way that explains successful task performance - then they
could ground real world contents. This requires overcoming a challenge: the
text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging
in the right sorts of tasks.

*Chenyi Zhou, Zhengyan Shi, Yuan Yao, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen, Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiOT is a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization in LLMs, addressing diversity and semantic drift issues by using text gradients, residual connections, and a tree structure. It outperforms existing methods and manual prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods lack diversity and suffer from semantic drift, limiting LLM performance.

Method: RiOT iteratively refines prompts using text gradients, generates diverse candidates, selects the best via perplexity, and uses residual connections to mitigate semantic drift. A tree structure ensures scalability.

Result: RiOT outperforms previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: RiOT effectively addresses diversity and semantic drift, enhancing LLM performance through scalable and flexible prompt optimization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their
potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies
on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt
optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration
of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations
for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we
propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic
prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients,
generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects
the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text
residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining
beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently
manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense,
mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT
outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

*Yao Lu, Zhaiyuan Ji, Jiawei Du, Yu Shanqing, Qi Xuan, Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAnnotator is a multi-model cooperative annotation framework that reduces costs and improves accuracy by combining LLMs and SLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and low accuracy of LLMs in fine-grained semantic tasks by leveraging SLMs and a cooperative annotation approach.

Method: A two-layer framework: meta-controller (LLMs for selection, code generation, and verification) and task-specialist (SLMs for voting). Uses continual learning to fine-tune SLMs.

Result: Outperforms LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings, reducing cost by 74.15% and improving accuracy by 6.21%.

Conclusion: AutoAnnotator offers a cost-effective and accurate alternative to LLM-based annotation, especially for fine-grained tasks.

Abstract: Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has
two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale
annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained
semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity
classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of
Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these
problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and
design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.
Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level
meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to
select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify
difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple
SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use
the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller
layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages
through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of
SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing
open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.
Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to
directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by
6.21%. Project page: https://github.com/Zhaiyuan-Ji/AutoAnnotator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fall short in assessing competitive-level code reasoning in LLMs.

Method: OJBench includes 232 programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, tested on 37 models.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle with highly challenging competition-level problems.

Conclusion: Competitive-level code reasoning remains a significant challenge for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing
code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of
these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap,
we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the
competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232
programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous
test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models,
reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that
even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and
Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level
problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in
competitive-level code reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a generative language model for Nepali hinders downstream tasks, prompting the development of NepaliGPT to fill this gap.

Method: The research collects the Devanagari Corpus and creates a benchmark dataset (4,296 QA pairs), then trains NepaliGPT.

Result: NepaliGPT achieves a perplexity of 26.32245, ROUGE-1 score of 0.2604, causal coherence of 81.25%, and causal consistency of 85.41%.

Conclusion: NepaliGPT successfully addresses the gap in Nepali NLP, demonstrating strong generative capabilities.

Abstract: After the release of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained huge
popularity in recent days and thousands of variants of LLMs have been released.
However, there is no generative language model for the Nepali language, due to
which other downstream tasks, including fine-tuning, have not been explored
yet. To fill this research gap in the Nepali NLP space, this research proposes
\textit{NepaliGPT}, a generative large language model tailored specifically for
the Nepali language. This research introduces an advanced corpus for the Nepali
language collected from several sources, called the Devanagari Corpus.
Likewise, the research introduces the first NepaliGPT benchmark dataset
comprised of 4,296 question-answer pairs in the Nepali language. The proposed
LLM NepaliGPT achieves the following metrics in text generation: Perplexity of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges of applying LLMs to long texts, proposing a framework to categorize failure modes and validating multi-agent chunking as an effective solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the difficulty of using LLMs for long-context tasks by identifying and mitigating failure modes.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework categorizing failure modes and tests multi-agent chunking on tasks like retrieval, QA, and summarization.

Result: Experiments confirm the framework's validity and show chunk-based processing can outperform advanced models like GPT4o for large inputs.

Conclusion: A principled framework and chunking strategy offer a viable solution for handling long contexts in LLMs.

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long
texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes
of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task
noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect
integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze
when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length
sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each
chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and
summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that
favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with
input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured
with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o
applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding
framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts
in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REIS is an In-Storage Processing (ISP) system designed to optimize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by addressing bottlenecks in retrieval, improving performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) lack dynamic knowledge updates, and RAG's retrieval stage is inefficient due to data movement overheads in Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS).

Method: REIS introduces three mechanisms: a linked database layout, ISP-tailored data placement, and leveraging existing storage computational resources for ANNS.

Result: REIS improves retrieval performance by 13x and energy efficiency by 55x compared to server-grade systems.

Conclusion: REIS effectively addresses RAG's retrieval bottleneck with minimal hardware modifications, enhancing efficiency and adoption potential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is
confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived
knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three
stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes
a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is
mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant
items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement
overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these
overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that
accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing
works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to
ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected
by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting
performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system
tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.
First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to
their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables
efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that
distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a
lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that
uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared
to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of
retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StoryWriter is a multi-agent framework for long story generation, addressing coherence and complexity through outline, planning, and writing agents. It outperforms baselines and generates a high-quality dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with long story generation due to issues in discourse coherence and narrative complexity.

Method: Proposes StoryWriter with three modules: outline agent (event-based outlines), planning agent (detailed event planning), and writing agent (dynamic story generation).

Result: Outperforms baselines in quality and length, generates a dataset of 6,000 long stories (~8,000 words each), and fine-tunes models (Llama3.1-8B, GLM4-9B) for advanced performance.

Conclusion: StoryWriter effectively addresses long story generation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Long story generation remains a challenge for existing large language models
(LLMs), primarily due to two main factors: (1) discourse coherence, which
requires plot consistency, logical coherence, and completeness in the long-form
generation, and (2) narrative complexity, which requires an interwoven and
engaging narrative. To address these challenges, we propose StoryWriter, a
multi-agent story generation framework, which consists of three main modules:
(1) outline agent, which generates event-based outlines containing rich event
plots, character, and event-event relationships. (2) planning agent, which
further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter
to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which
dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate
and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We
conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly
outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and
length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains
about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$
words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning
on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which
demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting implicit hate speech in social media by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. It proposes a method involving influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation using advanced models, achieving a significant F1 score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit hate speech is a growing issue on social media, often overlooked in traditional harmful speech datasets due to its subtle nature and annotator subjectivity. The paper aims to improve detection by utilizing existing datasets more effectively.

Method: The approach includes three steps: identifying influential samples, reannotating them, and augmenting the dataset using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o to enhance generalizability.

Result: The method improves implicit hate speech detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score increase over the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the detection of implicit hate speech, demonstrating significant performance improvements and potential for broader application.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social
media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on
harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect
veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on
lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present
in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly
recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are
prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by
annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability
across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our
method comprises three key components: influential sample identification,
reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit
hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the
baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIC is a novel in-context learning framework for reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages, improving accuracy by selecting effective examples from high-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual reward models are unreliable for low-resource Indic languages due to lack of preference data, making traditional training impractical.

Method: RELIC uses a retriever trained with a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from high-resource languages that highlight distinctions between responses.

Result: RELIC improves reward model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, outperforming zero-shot and state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.81%.

Conclusion: RELIC effectively addresses the challenge of reward modeling in low-resource languages by leveraging in-context learning.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are
primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting
in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting
large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively
expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address
this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for
reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with
a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary
high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between
preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three
preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art
open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward
model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming
existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic
language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13%
improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example

### [50] [Measuring (a Sufficient) World Model in LLMs: A Variance Decomposition Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16584)
*Nadav Kunievsky, James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate if LLMs have a robust world model by analyzing response variability across semantically equivalent prompts. Larger models show more robustness but not uniformly across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing LLM reliability in high-stakes applications requires understanding if they possess a structured world model for generalization beyond surface patterns.

Method: Introduces an evaluation approach decomposing response variability into user purpose, articulation, and model instability to measure semantic grounding.

Result: Larger models attribute more variability to user purpose, indicating a stronger world model, though improvements are modest and not uniform across domains.

Conclusion: Semantic diagnostics are crucial for assessing LLM world models, moving beyond accuracy benchmarks to evaluate internal understanding stability.

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a
structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond
surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in
high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether
an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing
consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing
between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation
approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three
components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model
instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the
variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than
superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how
much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model
instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs
across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater
share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more
robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do
not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their
advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the
importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic
diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's
internal understanding of the world.

### [52] [Modeling Public Perceptions of Science in Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16622)
*Jiaxin Pei, Dustin Wright, Isabelle Augenstin, David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework to model public perception of science news, using a large dataset and NLP models to analyze and predict engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of anticipating how audiences perceive scientific news and improve science communication.

Method: Developed a computational framework and NLP models to analyze public perception, using a dataset of 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants.

Result: Frequency of science news consumption drives perception, and estimated perception scores predict public engagement (e.g., comments, upvotes).

Conclusion: Nuanced perception modeling is crucial for predicting public interest and engagement with scientific content.

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and
understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of
information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will
perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a
computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,
such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,
we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations
from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable
insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We
further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong
performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of
science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors
affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a
predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement
with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption
is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal
influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully
designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public
perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final
engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive
significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different
scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.
Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception
modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public
interest and engagement with scientific content.

### [53] [Initial Investigation of LLM-Assisted Development of Rule-Based Clinical NLP System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16628)
*Jianlin Shi, Brian T. Bucher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to automate the development of rule-based NLP systems, achieving high recall in clinical text snippet identification and perfect key term extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based NLP systems are preferred in clinical settings for interpretability and efficiency, but manual development is labor-intensive.

Method: Employ LLMs during the development phase to automate snippet identification and keyword extraction for rule-based NER.

Result: High recall in snippet identification (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and perfect key term extraction (1.0).

Conclusion: LLMs enable faster, cost-effective, and transparent development of rule-based NLP systems compared to deep learning.

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs),
rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical
settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However,
their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in
tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems
development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first
two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from
the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the
rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments
demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text
snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.
This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development,
enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with
significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared
with deep learning model-based solutions.

### [54] [Long-Context Generalization with Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16640)
*Pavlo Vasylenko, Marcos Treviso, Andr√© F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using sparse attention mechanisms with ASEntmax to improve focus on fixed-size patterns in transformers, outperforming traditional softmax methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional softmax attention disperses focus as sequence length grows, harming tasks requiring precise attention on fixed patterns.

Method: Introduces ASEntmax, a sparse attention mechanism with learnable temperature, and optimizes position encodings.

Result: ASEntmax with proper position encodings outperforms softmax and other baselines in long-context generalization.

Conclusion: Sparse attention and adaptive mechanisms like ASEntmax enhance transformer performance for tasks needing precise focus.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

*Co Tran, Salman Paracha, Adil Hafeez, Shuguang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Arch-Router, a 1.5B model for preference-aligned routing of LLMs, addressing limitations of current routing methods by capturing human preferences and enabling flexible model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routing approaches lack alignment with human preferences and flexibility in model selection, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Proposes Arch-Router, a compact model that maps queries to user-defined domains or action types for routing decisions, supporting new models without retraining.

Result: Achieves SOTA in matching queries with human preferences on conversational datasets, outperforming proprietary models.

Conclusion: Arch-Router enhances routing transparency, flexibility, and preference alignment, with the model publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each
optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing
has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different
models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:
they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human
preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select
from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned
routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to
user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --
offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.
Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that
learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.
Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without
requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on
conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top
proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and
makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available

*Ananth Agarwal, Jasper Jian, Christopher D. Manning, Shikhar Murty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probing syntactic features in LLMs doesn't reliably predict downstream syntactic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if probing accuracy in LLMs correlates with their actual syntactic performance in tasks.

Method: Evaluated 32 transformer models using probing and targeted syntax evaluations.

Result: Syntactic features from probing don't predict downstream syntactic behaviors.

Conclusion: Latent syntactic representations from probing are disconnected from observable syntactic performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when
processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding
of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which
they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability
research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being
linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet
established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream
syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we
evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features
extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations
across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial
disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and
observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

*Hyunsoo Yun, Eun Hak Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LegiGPT, a framework combining LLM and XAI, analyzes transportation-related legislative proposals in South Korea, revealing key factors like political affiliations and sponsor characteristics influencing policymaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of lawmakers' political ideologies on legislative decision-making, particularly in transportation policy.

Method: LegiGPT uses GPT-4 for zero-shot classification of bills and XAI to analyze relationships between party affiliation and attributes.

Result: Conservative and progressive sponsors, district size, and electoral population significantly shape legislative outcomes, with bipartisan contributions.

Conclusion: LegiGPT offers insights into legislative dynamics, aiding future policy development and governance.

Abstract: Given the significant influence of lawmakers' political ideologies on
legislative decision-making, understanding their impact on policymaking is
critically important. We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates
a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a
multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting
with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,
we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political
affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence
transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify
transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process
based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then
applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated
attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative
and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,
are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest
that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms
of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated
approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and
guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure
planning and governance.

### [58] [ReasonGRM: Enhancing Generative Reward Models through Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16712)
*Bin Chen, Xinzge Gao, Chuanrui Hu, Penghang Yu, Hua Zhang, Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasonGRM is a three-stage framework improving generative reward models by enhancing reasoning paths, reducing hallucinations, and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative reward models (GRMs) lack strong reasoning, leading to incomplete or speculative reasoning paths and hallucinations.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Zero-RL for concise reasoning paths, 2) Novel metric $R^\star$ to score paths, 3) Reinforcement learning refinement.

Result: Outperforms previous GRMs by 1.8% and proprietary models like GPT-4o by up to 5.6%.

Conclusion: ReasonGRM demonstrates the value of reasoning-aware training and high-quality rationale selection for reliable preference modeling.

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar
reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is
limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or
overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key
information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a
three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL
is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the
likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their
generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with
minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during
training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through
reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference
discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that
ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such
as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale
selection for reliable preference modeling.

### [59] [The Role of Model Confidence on Bias Effects in Measured Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16724)
*Xinyi Liu, Weiguang Wang, Hangfeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how bias affects epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in LLMs, finding that mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification, especially when model confidence is low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty in LLMs is crucial for reliable outcomes, but it's complicated by aleatoric uncertainty and bias.

Method: Experiments on Visual Question Answering tasks with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL, analyzing the impact of bias on uncertainty quantification.

Result: Bias induces greater changes in uncertainties when model confidence is low, leading to underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (overconfidence).

Conclusion: Bias mitigation improves uncertainty quantification, and understanding its effects can inform advanced techniques for LLMs.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended
tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's
lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,
quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the
presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.
While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may
also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we
conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that
mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in
GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information
when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect
measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free
confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases
induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is
lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater
underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,
whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric
uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias
mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the
development of more advanced techniques.

TL;DR: LIRAS integrates linguistic and visual inputs for social reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language provides critical social insights, especially in novel situations where visual cues are insufficient.

Method: LIRAS combines multimodal language models with Bayesian inverse planning to create unified symbolic representations.

Result: The model outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing human judgments.

Conclusion: LIRAS effectively integrates language and vision for context-specific social inferences.

Abstract: Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account
information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful
source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where
language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics
and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed.
In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a
framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate
linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a
process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment
representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and
visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian
inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments.
On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive
science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively
lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing
human judgments across all domains.

TL;DR: SocialSim is a framework for simulating emotional support conversations by integrating social disclosure and awareness, outperforming crowdsourced data in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs of crowdsourcing ESC data and the oversight of social dynamics in existing methods necessitate a scalable, effective simulation approach.

Method: SocialSim uses a persona bank for social disclosure and cognitive reasoning for social awareness, creating the SSConv corpus.

Result: SSConv surpasses crowdsourced ESC data in quality, and a chatbot trained on it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SocialSim provides a scalable, high-quality solution for synthesizing ESC, enhancing accessibility to emotional care.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological
stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the
high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large
language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely
overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective
simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that
simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social
disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social
disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse
and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social
awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive
responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale
synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data.
We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim
offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible
and practical.

TL;DR: CAMO introduces a stealthy, efficient black-box jailbreak attack for LVLMs by decomposing malicious prompts into benign visual and textual fragments, evading detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak methods are detectable and inefficient; CAMO aims to exploit LVLMs' cross-modal reasoning for covert attacks.

Method: CAMO decomposes harmful prompts into benign fragments, leveraging LVLMs' cross-modal reasoning to reconstruct malicious instructions.

Result: CAMO outperforms prior attacks in stealth and efficiency, demonstrating robust performance and cross-model transferability.

Conclusion: CAMO highlights vulnerabilities in LVLMs' safety mechanisms, calling for advanced security solutions.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance
across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing
black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or
image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard
content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.
In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),
a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts
into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'
cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful
instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection
mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires
significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate
CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model
transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in
current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced,
alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Distillnote, an LLM-based framework, generates clinical note summaries using three techniques, achieving high compression and improved predictive performance for heart failure, with clinician preference for one-step summaries and efficiency for distilled summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the burden of clinical documentation by generating concise summaries of patient information using LLMs.

Method: Three summarization techniques: (1) One-step direct summarization, (2) Structured summarization, and (3) Distilled summarization. Evaluated using predictive performance (AUPRC), LLM-as-judge, and clinician comparisons.

Result: Distilled summaries achieve 79% text compression and 18.2% AUPRC improvement. One-step summaries are preferred for relevance, while distilled summaries excel in efficiency and reduce hallucinations.

Conclusion: Distillnote effectively balances summary quality and efficiency, with potential to enhance clinical documentation and decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate
concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical
documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a
framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000
admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct
summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured
summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled
summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how
useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a
model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text
compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on
the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an
LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with
clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by
clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled
summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio)
and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet
to encourage future research.

*Muyang Zheng, Yuanzhi Yao, Changting Lin, Rui Wang, Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIST, an iterative semantic tuning method for jailbreaking black-box LLMs, achieving high success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite alignment efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks due to discrete inputs, restricted access, and limited queries.

Method: MIST uses sequential synonym search and order-determining optimization to refine prompts for harmful content while preserving intent.

Result: MIST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack success and transferability across multiple models.

Conclusion: MIST is a practical and efficient solution for jailbreaking black-box LLMs.

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral
values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed
to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered
challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to
the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we
propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models
via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to
iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while
inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with
computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential
synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.
Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source
models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and
attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and
black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on
computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how language models of different architectures and sizes perform on high- and low-frequency facts, revealing notable differences in handling rare information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sample efficiency is critical for training language models, especially given the long-tailed distribution of information in real-world text. The study aims to understand how models learn and recall rare facts.

Method: Multiple models of varying architectures and sizes were trained on the same data. Relational facts were annotated by frequency, and model performance was analyzed across fact frequencies.

Result: Most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ significantly on low-frequency facts.

Conclusion: The analysis offers insights into how model architecture and size impact factual learning efficiency, particularly for rare information.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical
implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a
long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent
and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle
this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring
excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying
architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By
annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we
examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show
that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably
on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the

### [66] [Language Bottleneck Models: A Framework for Interpretable Knowledge Tracing and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16982)
*Antonin Berthon, Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) for Knowledge Tracing (KT), using interpretable natural-language summaries to improve accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KT methods lack interpretability, and LLM-based approaches may produce unreliable predictions. The goal is to create a method that ensures accuracy and human-understandable summaries.

Method: LBM uses an encoder LLM to generate interpretable summaries and a frozen decoder LLM to predict student responses. Training involves group-relative policy optimization to improve summary quality.

Result: LBMs match state-of-the-art KT and LLM methods in accuracy while requiring fewer student trajectories.

Conclusion: LBMs offer a transparent and accurate alternative for KT, balancing interpretability and predictive performance.

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education,
yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent
embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate
direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy
guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum
natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers
predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM
that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that
must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By
constraining all predictive information to pass through a short
natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate
information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic
arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the
accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring
orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training
the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding
accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

### [67] [TeXpert: A Multi-Level Benchmark for Evaluating LaTeX Code Generation by LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16990)
*Sahil Kale, Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeXpert, a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate LaTeX code from natural language prompts, revealing performance gaps and common errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack evaluation of LLMs' ability to generate LaTeX code for scientific documents, despite its importance for researchers.

Method: The authors create TeXpert, a dataset with natural language prompts for LaTeX generation across difficulty levels, and evaluate open and closed-source LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in LaTeX generation, with accuracy dropping as task complexity increases. Open-source models rival closed-source ones, and formatting/package errors are common.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for more diverse LaTeX training data in LLMs and provides a benchmark for future improvements.

Abstract: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold
standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models
(LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce
publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet
current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing
TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating
LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple
difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this
regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and
closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard
benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy
drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek
v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks;
and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack
of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset,
code, and model evaluations are available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes using knowledge graphs with standard edges and hyperedges for personalized language models, showing robustness in benchmarks like TriviaQA and DiaASQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of personalizing language models by retaining and utilizing extensive personal information for tailored responses.

Method: Utilizing external memory via knowledge graphs, including standard edges and two hyperedge types, based on AriGraph architecture.

Result: Improved robustness in graph construction and knowledge extraction, with maintained performance on modified benchmarks like DiaASQ.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively handles temporal dependencies and contradictory statements, enhancing personalized language model performance.

Abstract: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to
account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest.
Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval
Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of
retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized
responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external
memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by
the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for
the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and
two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and
DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of
graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we
augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into
dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at
different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the
question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed
architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

*Danielle R. Thomas, Conrad Borchers, Shambhavi Bhushan, Erin Gatz, Shivang Gupta, Kenneth R. Koedinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated feedback shows moderate learning benefits in tutor training, with effectiveness depending on learners' tendency to seek support. It's scalable and well-received.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of LLM-generated feedback on learning compared to traditional methods, especially in tutor training.

Method: Analyzed 2,600 lesson completions from 885 learners across three groups (LLM feedback, declined feedback, no access) using propensity scoring to address selection bias.

Result: Two out of seven lessons showed significant learning benefits (effect sizes 0.28, 0.33). LLM feedback was rated helpful and didn't increase completion time.

Conclusion: LLM feedback is a scalable, low-cost tool for improving learning in open-ended tasks, particularly in systems already providing feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet
their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing
feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated
explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training
lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we
compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who
received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those
without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address
potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined
to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher
predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher
at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,
two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits
from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These
moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the
learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not
significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as
helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and
scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing
systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open
datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

TL;DR: The paper describes IT-IST's submission to IWSLT 2025, focusing on a unified speech-to-text model for speech recognition, translation, and question answering, using small-scale LMs and high-quality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of instruction-following speech processing with efficient, small-scale models while leveraging high-quality and synthetic data.

Method: A unified speech-to-text model combining a pre-trained speech encoder and text decoder, trained in two phases: modality alignment and instruction fine-tuning.

Result: Submission results for the Short Track (speech recognition, translation, and spoken question answering) at IWSLT 2025.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of using small-scale models and curated data for effective speech processing tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents the IT-IST submission to the IWSLT 2025 Shared Task on

i.e., speech recognition, translation, and spoken question answering. Our model
is a unified speech-to-text model that integrates a pre-trained continuous
speech encoder and text decoder through a first phase of modality alignment and

*Xiaolong Wang, Zhaolu Kang, Wangyuxuan Zhai, Xinyue Lou, Yunghwei Lai, Ziyue Wang, Yawen Wang, Kaiyu Huang, Yile Wang, Peng Li, Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUCAR is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, failing to leverage mutual clarification between modalities.

Method: MUCAR includes a multilingual dataset and a dual-ambiguity dataset to test multimodal ambiguity resolution.

Result: Evaluations of 19 state-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps compared to humans.

Conclusion: Future research is needed to improve cross-modal ambiguity comprehension and advance multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text
alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with
clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in
natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal
benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly
on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual
clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating
multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.
MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions
are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a
dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with
ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to
yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive
evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both
open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to
human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more
sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the
boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance simultaneous speech translation performance across multiple language pairs using advanced models and policies.

Method: Utilizes Whisper for translation/transcription with AlignAtt policy, in-domain prompting, and EuroLLM for cascaded systems.

Result: Improves BLEU scores by 2 (Czech-English) and 13-22 (English-German/Chinese/Japanese). Also proposes a new latency measure.

Conclusion: The approach effectively boosts translation quality and introduces a novel latency metric.

Abstract: This paper describes Charles University submission to the Simultaneous Speech
Translation Task of the IWSLT 2025. We cover all four language pairs with a
direct or cascade approach. The backbone of our systems is the offline Whisper
speech model, which we use for both translation and transcription in
simultaneous mode with the state-of-the-art simultaneous policy AlignAtt. We
further improve the performance by prompting to inject in-domain terminology,
and we accommodate context. Our cascaded systems further use EuroLLM for
unbounded simultaneous translation. Compared to the Organizers' baseline, our
systems improve by 2 BLEU points on Czech to English and 13-22 BLEU points on
English to German, Chinese and Japanese on the development sets. Additionally,
we also propose a new enhanced measure of speech recognition latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tower+ is a suite of models balancing translation specialization and multilingual general-purpose capabilities, outperforming larger models in specific tasks while maintaining broad utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks like translation often sacrifices general-purpose capabilities, limiting real-world application. Tower+ aims to address this trade-off.

Method: A novel training recipe includes continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, using carefully curated data.

Result: Tower+ models (2B, 9B, 72B) outperform larger general-purpose and proprietary LLMs in translation and general tasks, with the 72B model achieving best-in-class translation and top multilingual results.

Conclusion: Tower+ demonstrates that optimizing for specific domains (e.g., translation) while rivaling frontier models in general capabilities is achievable.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for
reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine
translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing
general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and
instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world
applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce
Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both
translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a
Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual
general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds
on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised
fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate
data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks
involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general
instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.
Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and
proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers
best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top
results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we
introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our
findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general
capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as
translation and localization.

*Jiahao Cheng, Tiancheng Su, Jia Yuan, Guoxiu He, Jiawei Liu, Xinqi Tao, Jingwen Xie, Huaxia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT prompting reduces LLM hallucinations but weakens detection methods by obscuring key signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored impact of CoT prompting on hallucination detection in LLMs.

Method: Systematic empirical evaluation, including pilot experiments and analysis of CoT's effects on hallucination detection across LLMs.

Result: CoT reduces hallucinations but impairs detection accuracy by masking critical signals.

Conclusion: CoT introduces a trade-off between reducing hallucinations and maintaining detection effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations},
generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response
to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by
encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical
evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning
significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability
distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT
prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both
instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three
key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in
detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that
while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to
obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of
various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the
use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:

*Murtaza Nazir, Matthew Finlayson, John X. Morris, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PILS, a method for recovering hidden prompts from language model outputs using next-token probabilities, achieving significant improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses security and accountability concerns in language model deployments, particularly the risk of leaking private information through hidden prompts.

Method: PILS leverages low-dimensional subspace properties of language model outputs to compress next-token probabilities, enabling more effective inversion.

Result: PILS achieves 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates than previous methods, with strong generalization and performance on hidden system messages.

Conclusion: Next-token probabilities are a highly vulnerable attack surface, and PILS demonstrates their potential for inversion attacks.

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language
model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability
in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an
API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --
prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts
by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of
multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The
vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.
This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability
distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more
output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains
over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving
2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case
increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits
surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on
16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase
the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden
system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt
recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for
logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a
considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than
previously known.

*Adithya Bhaskar, Alexander Wettig, Tianyu Gao, Yihe Dong, Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the *KV footprint* metric to evaluate memory efficiency in language models, highlights flaws in prior KV eviction methods, and proposes improved techniques like *post-fill eviction* adaptation and *PruLong* for better performance and lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing memory costs of KV caches in long-context language models, and the lack of a fair comparison between existing KV eviction methods.

Method: Proposes *KV footprint* as a unified metric, adapts *post-fill eviction* methods for pre-filling, and introduces *PruLong* for optimized KV cache management.

Result: Reveals high peak memory in prior methods; adapted *post-fill eviction* and *PruLong* achieve lower KV footprints (12% improvement) while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides clarity on long-context inference methods and advances techniques to minimize KV footprint, paving the way for future improvements.

Abstract: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book
summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)
cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but
their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like
high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between
methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified
metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their
lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they
attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and
generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the
high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --
*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with
eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs
during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn
to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end
optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full
KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context
performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while
retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the
complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future
development to minimize the KV footprint.

TL;DR: CLEAR-3K is a dataset for testing causal reasoning in language models, revealing their tendency to confuse semantic similarity with causality and showing limited performance even in larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether language models can distinguish genuine causal relationships from mere semantic relatedness.

Method: A dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions (CLEAR-3K) was used to test 21 state-of-the-art language models of varying sizes.

Result: Models often confuse semantic similarity with causality, and performance plateaus at a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.55, even for the largest models.

Conclusion: CLEAR-3K serves as a benchmark for improving causal reasoning in language models, a critical capability for applications requiring accurate causal assessment.

Abstract: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions
designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement
causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and
challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and
genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of
21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we
identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse
semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap
instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as
parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical
about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.
Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,
CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine
causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for
applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint
for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information
processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of
four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically
adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to
complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically
through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems
into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content
synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this
paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,
aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,
spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By
providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to

*Kathleen C. Fraser, Hillary Dawkins, Isar Nejadgholi, Svetlana Kiritchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs can unintentionally remove safety features, posing risks. Safety benchmarks show high variance, raising concerns about evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical failure mode where fine-tuning LLMs removes safety alignment, even with benign data, and the need for reliable safety evaluations.

Method: Investigate the robustness of safety benchmarks by testing trivial variations in fine-tuning setups and evaluating the stochastic nature of LLMs.

Result: High variance in safety evaluation results due to minor changes in fine-tuning, highlighting unreliability.

Conclusion: Researchers must improve reporting methods for meaningful comparisons and address safety evaluation inconsistencies.

Abstract: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific
domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,
fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even
when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider
this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of
fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most
well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM
with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily
exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make
any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and
reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a
safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and
the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising
variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly
inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations
have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report
results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive gender bias analysis in AI research, covering diverse topics and trends.

Method: Utilized the AI Scholar dataset of 78K researchers to examine citation patterns, co-authorship homophily, and linguistic styles in papers.

Result: Found gender differences: citation gaps vary by age group, strong co-authorship homophily, and distinct linguistic styles in female-authored papers.

Conclusion: Highlights current demographic trends in AI, advocating for greater gender equality and diversity.

Abstract: While several previous studies have analyzed gender bias in research, we are
still missing a comprehensive analysis of gender differences in the AI

AI Scholar dataset of 78K researchers in the field of AI, we identify several
gender differences: (1) Although female researchers tend to have fewer overall
citations than males, this citation difference does not hold for all
academic-age groups; (2) There exist large gender homophily in co-authorship on
AI papers; (3) Female first-authored papers show distinct linguistic styles,
such as longer text, more positive emotion words, and more catchy titles than
male first-authored papers. Our analysis provides a window into the current

TL;DR: LaRS introduces unsupervised learning to create latent reasoning skills for efficient and scalable CoT prompting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CoT prompting methods are costly and hard to scale due to reliance on human experts or pre-trained LLMs for skill description.

Method: LaRS uses unsupervised learning to create latent representations of rationales (reasoning skills) and a policy to align skills for example selection.

Result: LaRS outperforms SOTA methods, processes example banks faster, reduces LLM inferences, and is robust to sub-optimal banks.

Conclusion: LaRS offers a scalable, efficient, and robust alternative to traditional skill-based CoT prompting methods.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a popular in-context learning (ICL)
approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex
reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples
that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting,
which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its
examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than
the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained
LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide
the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale.
Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills
(LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space
representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill.
Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required
reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by
aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. This
approach is theoretically grounded and compute-efficient, eliminating the need
for auxiliary LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirical results
demonstrate that LaRS consistently outperforms SOTA skill-based selection
methods, processing example banks four times faster, reducing LLM inferences
during the selection stage by half, and showing greater robustness to
sub-optimal example banks.

### [82] [AQA-Bench: An Interactive Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Sequential Reasoning Ability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09404)
*Siwei Yang, Bingchen Zhao, Cihang Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AQA-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating sequential reasoning in LLMs using interactive tasks like DFS, revealing insights about model performance and in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' sequential reasoning abilities in algorithmic tasks, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods.

Method: Developed AQA-Bench with three algorithms (binary search, DFS, BFS) and evaluated 14 LLMs using an interactive protocol.

Result: Closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4) outperformed open-source ones; in-context examples can hurt performance; small models benefit from predecessor steps.

Conclusion: The study highlights key factors in LLMs' sequential reasoning and encourages further research to enhance these capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts,
such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark
lies in its interactive evaluation protocol - for example, in DFS, the
availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's
traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively
remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves considering the possible
environmental feedback in the future steps. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench
with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and
breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 14
different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1)
Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show much stronger
sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2)
Naively providing in-context examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot
performance in an interactive environment due to over-fitting to examples. (3)
Instead of using optimal steps from another test case as the in-context
example, a very limited number of predecessor steps in the current test case
following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance.
(4) The performance gap between weak models and strong models is greatly due to
the incapability of weak models to start well. (5) The scaling correlation
between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even
showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on
advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AQA-Bench.

TL;DR: A survey analyzing 74 hallucination evaluation methods for LLMs, highlighting a shift in focus and proposing a unified pipeline to address fragmentation and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurate hallucination evaluation in LLMs due to methodological fragmentation and the need for new frameworks.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of 74 evaluation methods, formulation of a unified pipeline, and identification of limitations.

Result: 74% of methods target LLMs, revealing a paradigm shift and the need for improved evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: Proposes strategic directions for future research, including interpretability and application-specific criteria, to enhance hallucination evaluation systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a critical
challenge: accurate hallucination evaluation that ensures model reliability.
While Automatic Hallucination Evaluation (AHE) has emerged as essential, the
field suffers from methodological fragmentation, hindering both theoretical
understanding and practical advancement. This survey addresses this critical
gap through a comprehensive analysis of 74 evaluation methods, revealing that
74% specifically target LLMs, a paradigm shift that demands new evaluation
frameworks. We formulate a unified evaluation pipeline encompassing datasets
and benchmarks, evidence collection strategies, and comparison mechanisms,
systematically documenting the evolution from pre-LLM to post-LLM
methodologies. Beyond taxonomical organization, we identify fundamental
limitations in current approaches and their implications for real-world
deployment. To guide future research, we delineate key challenges and propose
strategic directions, including enhanced interpretability mechanisms and
integration of application-specific evaluation criteria, ultimately providing a
roadmap for developing more robust and practical hallucination evaluation
systems.

*Shaina Raza, Mizanur Rahman, Michael R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the BEADs dataset to address the lack of comprehensive bias evaluation tools in NLP, supporting multiple tasks and leveraging GPT-4 annotations for scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias detection datasets are limited in scope, often covering only one or two NLP tasks, which restricts their utility for broader bias mitigation efforts.

Method: The authors develop the BEADs dataset, annotated by GPT-4 and verified by experts, to support diverse NLP tasks like classification, generation, and bias quantification.

Result: BEADs effectively identifies biases during model fine-tuning, reduces biases in generation tasks, and highlights demographic biases in LLMs.

Conclusion: BEADs is released as a resource for detecting and mitigating bias in NLP, promoting responsible AI development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, these models
often inherit biases from their training data. While several datasets exist for
bias detection, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks, typically
classification or evaluation, and lack comprehensive coverage across a broader
range of tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across
Domains (BEADs) dataset, designed to support a wide range of NLP tasks,
including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and
benign language generation. A key contribution of this work is the
gold-standard annotation provided by GPT-4 for scalability, with expert
verification to ensure high reliability. BEADs can be used for both fine-tuning
models (for classification and generation tasks) and evaluating LLM behavior.
Our findings show that BEADs effectively surfaces various biases during model
fine-tuning and helps reduce biases in language generation tasks while
maintaining output quality. The dataset also highlights prevalent demographic
biases in LLMs during evaluation. We release BEADs as a practical resource for
detecting and mitigating bias across domains, supporting the development of
responsible AI systems. Project: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/BEAD/ Data:

### [85] [Learning to Refine with Fine-Grained Natural Language Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02397)
*Manya Wadhwa, Xinyu Zhao, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Detect, Critique, Refine (DCR) method for improving LLM-generated responses by breaking refinement into three steps: error detection, critique generation, and refinement with feedback. DCR outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing refinement methods focus on model sizes and problem types but overlook effective feedback. The paper aims to address this gap by proposing a structured feedback approach.

Method: DCR involves three steps: (1) detecting errors with a discriminative model, (2) generating fine-grained critiques, and (3) refining responses using feedback. Steps 2 and 3 use prompted or fine-tuned LLMs.

Result: DCR improves factual consistency in document summaries and outperforms end-to-end refinement methods and non-factuality-tuned models.

Conclusion: DCR provides a more effective framework for refining LLM outputs by leveraging structured feedback, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the capability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify and correct errors in LLM-generated responses. These refinement
approaches frequently evaluate what sizes of models are able to do refinement
for what problems, but less attention is paid to what effective feedback for
refinement looks like. In this work, we propose looking at refinement with
feedback as a composition of three distinct LLM competencies: (1) detection of
bad generations; (2) fine-grained natural language critique generation; (3)
refining with fine-grained feedback. The first step can be implemented with a
high-performing discriminative model and steps 2 and 3 can be implemented
either via prompted or fine-tuned LLMs. A key property of the proposed Detect,
Critique, Refine ("DCR") method is that the step 2 critique model can give
fine-grained feedback about errors, made possible by offloading the
discrimination to a separate model in step 1. We show that models of different
capabilities benefit from refining with DCR on the task of improving factual
consistency of document grounded summaries. Overall, DCR consistently
outperforms existing end-to-end refinement approaches and current trained
models not fine-tuned for factuality critiquing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces sPhinX, a multilingual synthetic instruction tuning dataset, and LANGIT, a fine-tuning strategy, to improve non-English performance of LLMs without sacrificing English capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap of LLMs in non-English languages compared to English.

Method: Construct sPhinX by augmenting English instruction-response pairs with multilingual translations and use LANGIT for N-shot guided fine-tuning.

Result: Improved Mistral-7B and Phi-3-Small performance by 39.8% and 11.2% respectively across multilingual benchmarks, with minimal catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances multilingual capabilities of LLMs while maintaining strong English performance.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in English, a
significant performance gap remains in non-English languages. To address this,
we introduce a novel approach for strategically constructing a multilingual
synthetic instruction tuning dataset, sPhinX. Unlike prior methods that
directly translate fixed instruction-response pairs, sPhinX enhances diversity
by selectively augmenting English instruction-response pairs with multilingual
translations. Additionally, we propose LANGIT, a novel N-shot guided
fine-tuning strategy, which further enhances model performance by incorporating
contextually relevant examples in each training sample. Our ablation study
shows that our approach enhances the multilingual capabilities of Mistral-7B
and Phi-3-Small improving performance by an average of 39.8% and 11.2%,
respectively, across multilingual benchmarks in reasoning, question answering,
reading comprehension, and machine translation. Moreover, sPhinX maintains
strong performance on English LLM benchmarks while exhibiting minimal to no
catastrophic forgetting, even when trained on 51 languages.

*Michael C. Stern, Maria M. Pi√±ango*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A dynamic neural model of lexical meaning for polysemous words like 'have' is proposed, tested, and validated through simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how lexical polysemy arises from neural dynamics and continuous semantic dimensions.

Method: A neural model maps 'have' to conceptual dimensions (connectedness, control asymmetry), simulating real-time meaning retrieval as activation patterns between metastable states.

Result: Simulations replicate known effects (contextual modulation, individual variation) and predict a new relationship between reading time and acceptability. Experiments confirm predictions.

Conclusion: Lexical polysemy emerges from nonlinear neural dynamics, with meanings as metastable states on continuous semantic dimensions.

Abstract: We propose and computationally implement a dynamic neural model of lexical
meaning, and experimentally test its behavioral predictions. We demonstrate the
architecture and behavior of the model using as a test case the English lexical
item 'have', focusing on its polysemous use. In the model, 'have' maps to a
semantic space defined by two continuous conceptual dimensions, connectedness
and control asymmetry, previously proposed to parameterize the conceptual
system for language. The mapping is modeled as coupling between a neural node
representing the lexical item and neural fields representing the conceptual
dimensions. While lexical knowledge is modeled as a stable coupling pattern,
real-time lexical meaning retrieval is modeled as the motion of neural
activation patterns between metastable states corresponding to semantic
interpretations or readings. Model simulations capture two previously reported
empirical observations: (1) contextual modulation of lexical semantic
interpretation, and (2) individual variation in the magnitude of this
modulation. Simulations also generate a novel prediction that the by-trial
relationship between sentence reading time and acceptability should be
contextually modulated. An experiment combining self-paced reading and
acceptability judgments replicates previous results and confirms the new model
prediction. Altogether, results support a novel perspective on lexical
polysemy: that the many related meanings of a word are metastable neural
activation states that arise from the nonlinear dynamics of neural populations
governing interpretation on continuous semantic dimensions.

TL;DR: A survey on deep learning-based frameworks for understanding Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), covering methods, comparisons, and future trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VRD information extraction is labor-intensive; deep learning offers efficient, multimodal solutions.

Method: Categorizes and analyzes methods by modeling strategies, tasks, and components like feature representation and fusion.

Result: Identifies strengths, limitations, and suitability of approaches for various applications.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges and trends, guiding future research and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) play a vital role in domains such as academia,
finance, healthcare, and marketing, as they convey information through a
combination of text, layout, and visual elements. Traditional approaches to
extracting information from VRDs rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual
annotation, making them labor-intensive and inefficient. Recent advances in
deep learning have transformed this landscape by enabling multimodal models
that integrate vision, language, and layout features through pretraining,
significantly improving information extraction performance. This survey
presents a comprehensive overview of deep learning-based frameworks for VRD
Content Understanding (VRD-CU). We categorize existing methods based on their
modeling strategies and downstream tasks, and provide a comparative analysis of
key components, including feature representation, fusion techniques, model
architectures, and pretraining objectives. Additionally, we highlight the
strengths and limitations of each approach and discuss their suitability for
different applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of current
challenges and emerging trends, offering guidance for future research and
practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Re-TASK framework, a novel model addressing the limitations of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in domain-specific tasks by focusing on capability, skill, and knowledge. It proposes a Chain-of-Learning (CoL) paradigm and a prompting strategy, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of applying CoT to domain-specific tasks, where LLMs struggle with task decomposition and execution.

Method: The method involves the Re-TASK framework, which revisits tasks from capability, skill, and knowledge perspectives, using Bloom's Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. It introduces CoL and a prompting strategy for targeted knowledge and skill adaptation.

Result: Experiments show improvements of 45.00% on Yi-1.5-9B and 24.50% on Llama3-Chinese-8B for legal tasks, demonstrating Re-TASK's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Re-TASK enhances LLM performance in specialized domains, offering a promising approach for domain-specific task solving.

Abstract: The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm has become a pivotal method for solving
complex problems with large language models (LLMs). However, its application to
domain-specific tasks remains challenging, as LLMs often fail to decompose
tasks accurately or execute subtasks effectively. This paper introduces the
Re-TASK framework, a novel theoretical model that revisits LLM tasks from
capability, skill, and knowledge perspectives, drawing on the principles of
Bloom's Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. While CoT provides a
workflow-centric perspective on tasks, Re-TASK introduces a Chain-of-Learning
(CoL) paradigm that highlights task dependencies on specific capability items,
further broken down into their constituent knowledge and skill components. To
address CoT failures, we propose a Re-TASK prompting strategy, which
strengthens task-relevant capabilities through targeted knowledge injection and
skill adaptation. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate the
effectiveness of Re-TASK. In particular, we achieve improvements of 45.00% on
Yi-1.5-9B and 24.50% on Llama3-Chinese-8B for legal tasks. These results
highlight the potential of Re-TASK to significantly enhance LLM performance and
its applicability in specialized domains. We release our code and data at

*Nicolas Yax, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Stefano Palminteri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogProber is a new algorithm designed to detect contamination in LLMs by focusing on question familiarity, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contamination in LLMs, where test data leaks into training, undermines fair performance evaluation. Existing detection methods for short text sequences are limited.

Method: LogProber detects contamination in a black-box setting by analyzing familiarity with questions rather than answers.

Result: LogProber is shown to be efficient and effective, though some contamination forms may still evade detection based on algorithm design.

Conclusion: LogProber offers a promising approach to contamination detection, but further refinement is needed to address its limitations.

Abstract: In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data
leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the
evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped
from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore
crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the
performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to
address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text
sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods
have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical. In the present
paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be
able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some
of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than
the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in
comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations,
and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending
on the design of the detection algorithm.

*Ziyan Cui, Ning Li, Huaikang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs replicate psychological experiments with high success for main effects but overestimate effect sizes and struggle with socially sensitive topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of LLMs in replicating human psychological studies and identify their strengths and limitations.

Method: Replicated 156 psychological experiments using GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek v3, comparing results to human studies.

Result: LLMs showed high replication rates for main effects (73-81%) and moderate success with interaction effects (46-63%), but overestimated effect sizes and struggled with socially sensitive topics.

Conclusion: LLMs are useful for pilot testing and hypothesis validation but require nuanced interpretation and human validation, especially for complex or sensitive research.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific
research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human
behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. We
conducted a large-scale study replicating 156 psychological experiments from
top social science journals using three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek v3). Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate
high replication rates for main effects (73-81%) and moderate to strong success
with interaction effects (46-63%), They consistently produce larger effect
sizes than human studies, with Fisher Z values approximately 2-3 times higher
than human studies. Notably, LLMs show significantly lower replication rates
for studies involving socially sensitive topics such as race, gender and
ethics. When original studies reported null findings, LLMs produced significant
results at remarkably high rates (68-83%) - while this could reflect cleaner
data with less noise, as evidenced by narrower confidence intervals, it also
suggests potential risks of effect size overestimation. Our results demonstrate
both the promise and challenges of LLMs in psychological research, offering
efficient tools for pilot testing and rapid hypothesis validation while
enriching rather than replacing traditional human subject studies, yet
requiring more nuanced interpretation and human validation for complex social
phenomena and culturally sensitive research questions.

TL;DR: The paper investigates core knowledge deficits in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using the CoreCognition benchmark, revealing their underperformance and reliance on shortcut learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack robustness in intuitive tasks, hypothesized to stem from missing core knowledge‚Äîinnate human cognitive abilities.

Method: Introduces CoreCognition, a benchmark with 12 core knowledge concepts, evaluating 230 models across 11 prompts (2,530 data points).

Result: MLLMs underperform on low-level abilities, show poor scalability, and rely on shortcut learning rather than genuine understanding.

Conclusion: MLLMs lack core knowledge representation, highlighting the need for improved foundational cognitive modeling.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
abilities over high-level perception and reasoning, their robustness in the
wild remains limited, often falling short on tasks that are intuitive and
effortless for humans. We examine the hypothesis that these deficiencies stem
from the absence of core knowledge--rudimentary cognitive abilities innate to
humans from early childhood. To explore the core knowledge representation in
MLLMs, we introduce CoreCognition, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 12 core
knowledge concepts grounded in developmental cognitive science. We evaluate 230
models with 11 different prompts, leading to a total of 2,530 data points for
analysis. Our experiments uncover four key findings, collectively demonstrating
core knowledge deficits in MLLMs: they consistently underperform and show
reduced, or even absent, scalability on low-level abilities relative to
high-level ones. Finally, we propose Concept Hacking, a novel controlled
evaluation method that reveals MLLMs fail to progress toward genuine core
knowledge understanding, but instead rely on shortcut learning as they scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Self-REF, a method to train LLMs to reliably express confidence in their answers, improving downstream accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes settings, unreliable LLM outputs can be risky. Knowing when an answer is trustworthy allows systems to route questions appropriately or default to safe behavior.

Method: Self-Reflection with Error-based Feedback (Self-REF) introduces confidence tokens into LLMs to extract reliable confidence scores.

Result: Confidence tokens outperform conventional methods like verbalizing confidence or token probabilities, showing significant gains in routing and rejection tasks.

Conclusion: Self-REF enhances LLM reliability by enabling accurate confidence expression, improving practical deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
several tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, especially in high-stakes settings, it becomes vital to know when the
output of an LLM may be unreliable. Depending on whether an answer is
trustworthy, a system can then choose to route the question to another expert,
or otherwise fall back on a safe default behavior. In this work, we study the
extent to which LLMs can reliably indicate confidence in their answers, and how
this notion of confidence can translate into downstream accuracy gains. We
propose Self-Reflection with Error-based Feedback (Self-REF), a lightweight
training strategy to teach LLMs to express confidence in whether their answers
are correct in a reliable manner. Self-REF introduces confidence tokens into
the LLM, from which a confidence score can be extracted. Compared to
conventional approaches such as verbalizing confidence and examining token
probabilities, we demonstrate empirically that confidence tokens show
significant improvements in downstream routing and rejection learning tasks.

*Emily Cheng, Francesca Franzon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how grammatical features like number and gender serve dual functions‚Äîsemantic encoding and agreement-based predictability‚Äîand proposes an information-theoretic framework to explain universal grammatical patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the consistent organizational patterns of grammatical features across languages, which are rooted in semantics but lack theoretical explanation.

Method: The study unifies semantic encoding and agreement-based predictability into an information-theoretic objective under cognitive constraints, analyzing perceptual attributes and measuring language samples.

Result: Grammatical organization is shown to derive from perceptual attributes, with grammars prioritizing efficient processing over semantic encoding.

Conclusion: Grammars universally balance semantic and functional goals, optimizing language processing efficiency.

Abstract: Grammatical features such as number and gender serve two central functions in
human languages. While they encode salient semantic attributes like numerosity
and animacy, they also offload sentence processing cost by predictably linking
words together via grammatical agreement. Grammars exhibit consistent
organizational patterns across diverse languages, invariably rooted in a
semantic foundation-a widely confirmed but still theoretically unexplained
phenomenon. To explain the basis of universal grammatical patterns, we unify
two fundamental properties of grammar, semantic encoding and agreement-based
predictability, into a single information-theoretic objective under cognitive
constraints, accounting for variable communicative need. Our analyses reveal
that grammatical organization provably inherits from perceptual attributes, and
our measurements on a diverse language sample show that grammars prioritize
functional goals, promoting efficient language processing over semantic
encoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability (ICET) in VLMs where early exits from image encoder layers increase harmful outputs. It proposes Layer-Wise PPO (L-PPO) to mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the safety alignment challenge in VLMs due to uneven harmful information distribution in intermediate layers.

Method: Proposes L-PPO, a modified Clip-PPO algorithm, for layer-wise multi-modal RLHF to reduce harmful outputs from early exits.

Result: Experiments on three VLMs show L-PPO effectively reduces harmfulness caused by ICET vulnerability.

Conclusion: L-PPO is a simple yet effective solution to improve safety in VLMs by addressing layer-wise vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have improved significantly in their
capabilities, but their complex architecture makes their safety alignment
challenging. In this paper, we reveal an uneven distribution of harmful
information across the intermediate layers of the image encoder and show that
skipping a certain set of layers and exiting early can increase the chance of
the VLM generating harmful responses. We call it as "Image enCoder Early-exiT"
based vulnerability (ICET). Our experiments across three VLMs: LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Llama 3.2, show that performing early exits from the image
encoder significantly increases the likelihood of generating harmful outputs.
To tackle this, we propose a simple yet effective modification of the
Clipped-Proximal Policy Optimization (Clip-PPO) algorithm for performing
layer-wise multi-modal RLHF for VLMs. We term this as Layer-Wise PPO (L-PPO).
We evaluate our L-PPO algorithm across three multimodal datasets and show that
it consistently reduces the harmfulness caused by early exits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for lyrics generation with multi-level syllable control, addressing challenges in natural phrasing and song form adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming unnatural phrasing in conventional line-by-line lyrics generation by enabling precise syllable management.

Method: Proposes a framework for lyrics generation with syllable control at word, phrase, line, and paragraph levels, aware of song form.

Result: Generates complete lyrics aligned with input text, song form, and syllable constraints.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses syllable control and song form adherence in lyrics generation.

Abstract: Lyrics generation presents unique challenges, particularly in achieving
precise syllable control while adhering to song form structures such as verses
and choruses. Conventional line-by-line approaches often lead to unnatural
phrasing, underscoring the need for more granular syllable management. We
propose a framework for lyrics generation that enables multi-level syllable
control at the word, phrase, line, and paragraph levels, aware of song form.
Our approach generates complete lyrics conditioned on input text and song form,
ensuring alignment with specified syllable constraints. Generated lyrics

*Svetlana Churina, Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates GPT-3.5 Turbo's performance in political argumentation, comparing fine-tuning on high-incivility Twitter data versus low-incivility Reddit data. Results show Reddit-finetuned models are safer but rigid, while cross-platform fine-tuning increases toxicity. Prompting helps but doesn't fully mitigate toxicity. A rhetorical evaluation rubric is introduced for LLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of incivility in online political discussions and develop AI systems for productive argumentation.

Method: Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on high-incivility Twitter replies and low-incivility Reddit posts, evaluating rhetorical framing and deliberative quality.

Result: Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rigid arguments; cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors but not fully.

Conclusion: The study provides a rhetorical evaluation rubric and guidelines for deploying LLMs in content moderation and deliberation support.

Abstract: The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a
challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and
rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report
experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of
political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S.
Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView.
We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies
shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated
arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but
rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies
toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks,
but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We
introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical
guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and
deliberation support.

*Daixuan Cheng, Shaohan Huang, Ziyu Zhu, Xintong Zhang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Zhongzhi Luan, Bo Dai, Zhenliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores domain adaptation for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation, achieving superior results in specialized fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the practical application of MLLMs in scientific and industrial domains by adapting them through post-training.

Method: Develops a generate-then-filter data synthesis pipeline, adopts a single-stage training approach, and evaluates performance in high-impact domains.

Result: The synthesized data and single-stage training outperform manual rules and closed-source models, demonstrating effectiveness in domain-specific tasks.

Conclusion: The study successfully adapts MLLMs to specialized domains, with open-sourced models, code, and data to foster further research.

Abstract: Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific
domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in
promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates
domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis,
training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only
open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates
diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs.
The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong
closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training
Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training
paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain
adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in
high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by
post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on
various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code,
and data to encourage future research in this area.

*Junyi Li, Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Think&Cite is a framework for attributed text generation in LLMs, using Self-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS) and Progress Reward Modeling to improve accuracy and evidence support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce incorrect information (hallucination), prompting the need for attributed text generation with supporting evidence.

Method: Proposes SG-MCTS, leveraging LLMs' self-reflection for multi-step reasoning and search integration, with Progress Reward Modeling for feedback.

Result: Outperforms baselines on three datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and attribution.

Conclusion: Think&Cite effectively addresses LLM hallucination by integrating reasoning and search, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: Despite their outstanding capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are
prone to hallucination and producing factually incorrect information. This
challenge has spurred efforts in attributed text generation, which prompts LLMs
to generate content with supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called Think&Cite, and formulate attributed text generation as a
multi-step reasoning problem integrated with search. Specifically, we propose
Self-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS), which capitalizes on the
self-reflection capability of LLMs to reason about the intermediate states of
MCTS for guiding the tree expansion process. To provide reliable and
comprehensive feedback, we introduce Progress Reward Modeling to measure the
progress of tree search from the root to the current state from two aspects,
i.e., generation and attribution progress. We conduct extensive experiments on
three datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms
baseline approaches.

*Yuki Ichihara, Yuu Jinnai, Kaito Ariu, Tetsuro Morimura, Eiji Uchibe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MBR decoding approaches optimality at rate O(n^(-1/2)) with high probability, outperforming MAP decoding in convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analytically explain the effectiveness of MBR decoding, which has been empirically validated but lacks theoretical understanding.

Method: Theoretical analysis of MBR decoding's convergence rate and comparison with MAP decoding under certain assumptions.

Result: MBR decoding converges to the optimal solution at rate O(n^(-1/2)) even when the language space is much larger than the reference set.

Conclusion: MBR decoding is theoretically justified for its strong performance and converges faster than MAP decoding in many cases.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding optimizes output selection by maximizing
the expected utility value of an underlying human distribution. While prior
work has shown the effectiveness of MBR decoding through empirical evaluation,
few studies have analytically investigated why the method is effective. As a
result of our analysis, we show that, given the size $n$ of the reference
hypothesis set used in computation, MBR decoding approaches the optimal
solution with high probability at a rate of $O\left(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$,
under certain assumptions, even though the language space $Y$ is significantly
larger $|Y|\gg n$. This result helps to theoretically explain the strong
performance observed in several prior empirical studies on MBR decoding. In
addition, we provide the performance gap for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)
decoding and compare it to MBR decoding. The result of this paper indicates
that MBR decoding tends to converge to the optimal solution faster than MAP
decoding in several cases.

### [102] [Knapsack Optimization-based Schema Linking for LLM-based Text-to-SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12911)
*Zheng Yuan, Hao Chen, Zijin Hong, Qinggang Zhang, Feiran Huang, Qing Li, Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KaSLA, a schema linking method using knapsack optimization to improve SQL generation by reducing missing and redundant schema elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current schema linking models struggle with missing or redundant schema elements, and existing metrics like recall and precision fail to capture these issues effectively.

Method: Proposes KaSLA, a hierarchical linking method using knapsack optimization to link tables and columns while minimizing redundancy.

Result: KaSLA outperforms large-scale LLMs like deepseek-v3 and improves SQL generation performance on Spider and BIRD benchmarks.

Conclusion: KaSLA effectively enhances schema linking and boosts SQL generation accuracy in Text2SQL models.

Abstract: Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the
accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL
generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle
with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial
reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to
capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking
performance. Motivated by this, we propose enhanced schema linking metrics by
introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack
optimization-based Schema Linking Approach (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking
method designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while
minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical
linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and
subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking
candidate space. In each linking process, it utilizes a knapsack optimization
approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited
tolerance of potentially redundant ones. With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B
achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs,
including deepseek-v3 with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method.
Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can
significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA Text2SQL models by
substituting their schema linking processes.

*Zichun Yu, Fei Peng, Jie Lei, Arnold Overwijk, Wen-tau Yih, Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Group-MATES optimizes language model pretraining by using a relational data influence model for efficient group-level data selection, achieving significant performance gains and reducing token requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the speed-quality frontier of language model pretraining by addressing the inefficiency of individual data selection methods.

Method: Group-MATES uses a relational data influence model, trained with sampled trajectories and oracle data influences, and partitions datasets into clusters for efficient selection.

Result: Achieves 3.5%-9.4% performance gains over random selection and reduces token requirements by up to 1.75x.

Conclusion: Group-MATES effectively elevates the speed-quality frontier, with relationship weights and cluster-based inference playing critical roles.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Group-MATES, an efficient group-level data
selection approach to optimize the speed-quality frontier of language model
pretraining. Specifically, Group-MATES parameterizes costly group-level
selection with a relational data influence model. To train this model, we
sample training trajectories of the language model and collect oracle data
influences alongside. The relational data influence model approximates the
oracle data influence by weighting individual influence with relationships
among training data. To enable efficient selection with our relational data
influence model, we partition the dataset into small clusters using
relationship weights and select data within each cluster independently.
Experiments on DCLM 400M-4x, 1B-1x, and 3B-1x show that Group-MATES achieves
3.5%-9.4% relative performance gains over random selection across 22 downstream
tasks, nearly doubling the improvements achieved by state-of-the-art individual
data selection baselines. Furthermore, Group-MATES reduces the number of tokens
required to reach a certain downstream performance by up to 1.75x,
substantially elevating the speed-quality frontier. Further analyses highlight
the critical role of relationship weights in the relational data influence
model and the effectiveness of our cluster-based inference. Our code is

TL;DR: HippoRAG 2 improves RAG by enhancing retrieval with deeper passage integration and LLM use, outperforming standard RAG in factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of standard RAG in mimicking human long-term memory dynamics, particularly in factual, sense-making, and associative tasks.

Method: Proposes HippoRAG 2, which enhances the Personalized PageRank algorithm with deeper passage integration and effective LLM use.

Result: Achieves a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over state-of-the-art models, with superior factual and sense-making capabilities.

Conclusion: HippoRAG 2 advances non-parametric continual learning for LLMs, bridging the gap between AI and human memory effectiveness.

Abstract: Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a
key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock
their full potential. Given the challenges in continual learning with large
language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the
dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector
retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of
human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with
various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely
sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic
factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this
unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms
standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory
tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in
HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective
online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the
effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in
associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also
exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.
This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Batayan is a Filipino benchmark evaluating LLMs on understanding, reasoning, and generation, addressing gaps in under-resourced languages like Filipino.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration of linguistic nuances in under-resourced languages, particularly Filipino, and the translationese bias in existing corpora.

Method: Introduces Batayan, a holistic benchmark with eight tasks (three novel for Filipino), covering Tagalog and Taglish, validated by native speakers for fluency and authenticity.

Result: Reveals performance gaps in LLMs for Filipino, highlighting under-representation in pre-training, challenges in modeling morphology, and the need for explicit language support.

Conclusion: Batayan provides a foundation for Filipino NLP progress, emphasizing culturally faithful dataset construction and community-driven development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities on widely benchmarked high-resource languages. However, linguistic
nuances of under-resourced languages remain unexplored. We introduce Batayan, a
holistic Filipino benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs across three key
natural language processing (NLP) competencies: understanding, reasoning, and
generation. Batayan consolidates eight tasks, three of which have not existed
prior for Filipino corpora, covering both Tagalog and code-switched Taglish
utterances. Our rigorous, native-speaker-driven adaptation and validation
processes ensures fluency and authenticity to the complex morphological and
syntactic structures of Filipino, alleviating the pervasive translationese bias
in existing Filipino corpora. We report empirical results on a variety of
open-source and commercial LLMs, highlighting significant performance gaps that
signal the under-representation of Filipino in pre-training corpora, the unique
hurdles in modeling Filipino's rich morphology and construction, and the
importance of explicit Filipino language support. Moreover, we discuss the
practical challenges encountered in dataset construction and propose principled
solutions for building culturally and linguistically-faithful resources in
under-represented languages. We also provide a public evaluation suite as a
clear foundation for iterative, community-driven progress in Filipino NLP.

*Ho Yin 'Sam' Ng, Ting-Yao Hsu, Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan, Branislav Kveton, Nedim Lipka, Franck Dernoncourt, Dongwon Lee, Tong Yu, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A. Rossi, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap introduces a dataset for personalized figure caption generation using multimodal profiles, improving caption quality by leveraging context from related figures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated captions lack personalization and rarely use multimodal inputs, necessitating a solution that incorporates both text and visual context.

Method: LaMP-Cap provides multimodal profiles (images, captions, and paragraphs) for target figures, tested with four LLMs to evaluate caption quality.

Result: Using profile information improves caption generation, with images in profiles proving more beneficial than text-only context.

Conclusion: Multimodal profiles enhance personalized caption generation, offering better alignment with author-written captions.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

*Laura Perez-Beltrachini, Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to quantify uncertainty in retrieval-augmented QA by predicting passage utility, outperforming simpler metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the usefulness of retrieved passages in QA models, which prior work did not evaluate.

Method: Train a lightweight neural model to predict passage utility for QA models.

Result: The approach efficiently approximates or outperforms more expensive sampling-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively quantifies passage utility, improving QA model performance.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented Question Answering (QA) helps QA models overcome
knowledge gaps by incorporating retrieved evidence, typically a set of
passages, alongside the question at test time. Previous studies show that this
approach improves QA performance and reduces hallucinations, without, however,
assessing whether the retrieved passages are indeed useful at answering
correctly. In this work, we propose to quantify the uncertainty of a QA model
via estimating the utility of the passages it is provided with. We train a
lightweight neural model to predict passage utility for a target QA model and
show that while simple information theoretic metrics can predict answer
correctness up to a certain extent, our approach efficiently approximates or
outperforms more expensive sampling-based methods. Code and data are available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: olmOCR is an open-source toolkit for high-quality PDF text extraction, outperforming top VLMs like GPT-4o, at a fraction of the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDFs offer vast training data for language models, but diverse formats and layouts make extraction challenging. Existing tools are either low-quality or prohibitively expensive.

Method: olmOCR uses a fine-tuned 7B vision language model trained on a diverse dataset (olmOCR-mix-0225) and is optimized for large-scale batch processing.

Result: olmOCR outperforms top VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and processes a million PDF pages for only $176 USD.

Conclusion: olmOCR provides a cost-effective, high-quality solution for PDF text extraction, with all components openly released.

Abstract: PDF documents have the potential to provide trillions of novel, high-quality
tokens for training language models. However, these documents come in a
diversity of types with differing formats and visual layouts that pose a
challenge when attempting to extract and faithfully represent the underlying
content for language model use. Traditional open source tools often produce
lower quality extractions compared to vision language models (VLMs), but
reliance on the best VLMs can be prohibitively costly (e.g., over $6,240 USD
per million PDF pages for GPT-4o) or infeasible if the PDFs cannot be sent to
proprietary APIs. We present olmOCR, an open-source toolkit for processing PDFs
into clean, linearized plain text in natural reading order while preserving
structured content like sections, tables, lists, equations, and more. Our
toolkit runs a fine-tuned 7B vision language model (VLM) trained on
olmOCR-mix-0225, a sample of 260,000 pages from over 100,000 crawled PDFs with
diverse properties, including graphics, handwritten text and poor quality
scans. olmOCR is optimized for large-scale batch processing, able to scale
flexibly to different hardware setups and can convert a million PDF pages for
only $176 USD. To aid comparison with existing systems, we also introduce
olmOCR-Bench, a curated set of 1,400 PDFs capturing many content types that
remain challenging even for the best tools and VLMs, including formulas,
tables, tiny fonts, old scans, and more. We find olmOCR outperforms even top
VLMs including GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2 and Qwen-2.5-VL. We openly release all
components of olmOCR: our fine-tuned VLM model, training code and data, an
efficient inference pipeline that supports vLLM and SGLang backends, and
benchmark olmOCR-Bench.

*Mollie Shichman, Claire Bonial, Austin Blodgett, Taylor Hudson, Francis Ferraro, Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FRIDA, a pipeline for fine-tuning small LLMs to enhance physical reasoning in disaster relief scenarios, outperforming larger models with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs are impractical for robotic deployment in disaster relief, necessitating smaller, efficient models with strong physical reasoning.

Method: Domain experts and linguists create high-quality few-shot prompts to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning small instruction-tuned models.

Result: Ablated FRIDA models, trained only on objects' physical state and function data, outperformed both full FRIDA models and base models in evaluations.

Conclusion: The FRIDA pipeline effectively instills physical common sense in small LLMs with minimal data, proving viable for disaster relief applications.

Abstract: During Human Robot Interactions in disaster relief scenarios, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have the potential for substantial physical reasoning to assist
in mission objectives. However, these capabilities are often found only in
larger models, which are frequently not reasonable to deploy on robotic
systems. To meet our problem space requirements, we introduce a dataset and
pipeline to create Field Reasoning and Instruction Decoding Agent (FRIDA)
models. In our pipeline, domain experts and linguists combine their knowledge
to make high-quality few-shot prompts used to generate synthetic data for
fine-tuning. We hand-curate datasets for this few-shot prompting and for
evaluation to improve LLM reasoning on both general and disaster-specific
objects. We concurrently run an ablation study to understand which kinds of
synthetic data most affect performance. We fine-tune several small
instruction-tuned models and find that ablated FRIDA models only trained on
objects' physical state and function data outperformed both the FRIDA models
trained on all synthetic data and the base models in our customized evaluation.
We demonstrate that the FRIDA pipeline is capable of instilling physical common
sense with minimal data.

*Hamish Ivison, Muru Zhang, Faeze Brahman, Pang Wei Koh, Pradeep Dasigi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates data selection methods for instruction-tuning language models at scale, finding that many recent methods underperform random selection, while a simpler method (RDS+) consistently excels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how well automated data selection methods scale to large datasets, as most prior work focuses on smaller datasets.

Method: Systematically tests data selection methods, selecting up to 2.5M samples from pools of up to 5.8M, and evaluates across 7 tasks.

Result: Many recent methods fail to outperform random selection, while RDS+ consistently performs better and is more compute-efficient.

Conclusion: Scaling properties of data selection methods need closer examination; RDS+ is a robust and efficient choice.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality training data from a larger pool is a crucial step
when instruction-tuning language models, as carefully curated datasets often
produce models that outperform those trained on much larger, noisier datasets.
Automated data selection approaches for instruction-tuning are typically tested
by selecting small datasets (roughly 10k samples) from small pools (100-200k
samples). However, popular deployed instruction-tuned models often train on
hundreds of thousands to millions of samples, subsampled from even larger data
pools. We present a systematic study of how well data selection methods scale
to these settings, selecting up to 2.5M samples from pools of up to 5.8M
samples and evaluating across 7 diverse tasks. We show that many recently
proposed methods fall short of random selection in this setting (while using
more compute), and even decline in performance when given access to larger
pools of data to select over. However, we find that a variant of
representation-based data selection (RDS+), which uses weighted mean pooling of
pretrained LM hidden states, consistently outperforms more complex methods
across all settings tested -- all whilst being more compute-efficient. Our
findings highlight that the scaling properties of proposed automated selection
methods should be more closely examined. We release our code, data, and models
at https://github.com/hamishivi/automated-instruction-selection.

*Songming Zhang, Xue Zhang, Tong Zhang, Bojie Hu, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignDistil is a token-level reward optimization method for LLM alignment, improving performance and convergence by addressing the limitations of sparse response-level rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM alignment methods use sparse response-level rewards, which can misalign token-level quality, leading to suboptimal performance and slow convergence.

Method: AlignDistil integrates DPO rewards into RLHF, proving equivalence to token-level distillation. It uses contrastive DPO rewards and adaptive logit extrapolation for balanced optimization.

Result: AlignDistil outperforms existing methods, showing faster convergence and better performance due to token-level reward optimization.

Conclusion: AlignDistil effectively addresses token-level misalignment in LLMs, offering a superior and efficient alternative to traditional alignment methods.

Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial
importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO).
However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response
are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation.
The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens
or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow
convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an
RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization.
Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective
and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a
token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly
combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we
further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the
pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a
reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different
tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct
an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and
showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward
optimization.

Result: Humans interleave references to entities more variably and consistently, while machines struggle with mixed references despite better generation quality.

Conclusion: The study reveals gaps in machine performance in handling coreferential expressions compared to humans, with tools and metrics made available for further research.

Abstract: We demonstrate that large multimodal language models differ substantially
from humans in the distribution of coreferential expressions in a visual
storytelling task. We introduce a number of metrics to quantify the
characteristics of coreferential patterns in both human- and machine-written
texts. Humans distribute coreferential expressions in a way that maintains
consistency across texts and images, interleaving references to different
entities in a highly varied way. Machines are less able to track mixed
references, despite achieving perceived improvements in generation quality.

### [113] [Dynamic Knowledge Integration for Evidence-Driven Counter-Argument Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05328)
*Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores dynamic external knowledge integration to enhance counter-argument generation in LLMs, introducing a curated dataset and a new evaluation method. Results show improved counter-argument quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce lengthy or unfactual responses in argumentative tasks, necessitating controlled, evidence-based approaches.

Method: Introduces a manually curated dataset and an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation method, integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web.

Result: Dynamic knowledge integration improves counter-argument quality in relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with real-time knowledge retrieval is promising for reliable counter-argumentation systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of dynamic external knowledge integration in
improving counter-argument generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). While
LLMs have shown promise in argumentative tasks, their tendency to generate
lengthy, potentially unfactual responses highlights the need for more
controlled and evidence-based approaches. We introduce a new manually curated
dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance
argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with
human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge
from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments,
particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The
findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external knowledge
retrieval offers a promising direction for developing more effective and
reliable counter-argumentation systems.

### [114] [QG-SMS: Enhancing Test Item Analysis via Student Modeling and Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05888)
*Bang Nguyen, Tingting Du, Mengxia Yu, Lawrence Angrave, Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces test item analysis into Question Generation (QG) evaluation, revealing shortcomings in existing methods and proposing a novel framework, QG-SMS, using Large Language Models for better assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QG evaluation lacks alignment with educational values. The study aims to bridge this gap by incorporating test item analysis to assess question quality.

Method: Pairs of candidate questions differing in quality (topic coverage, difficulty, etc.) are constructed. Existing QG evaluation methods are tested, and a new framework, QG-SMS, using Large Language Models for student modeling, is proposed.

Result: Existing QG evaluation methods fail to accurately assess test item quality. QG-SMS, with simulated student profiles, provides more effective and robust evaluations.

Conclusion: QG-SMS improves QG evaluation by leveraging simulated student modeling, addressing the limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: While the Question Generation (QG) task has been increasingly adopted in
educational assessments, its evaluation remains limited by approaches that lack
a clear connection to the educational values of test items. In this work, we
introduce test item analysis, a method frequently used by educators to assess
test question quality, into QG evaluation. Specifically, we construct pairs of
candidate questions that differ in quality across dimensions such as topic
coverage, item difficulty, item discrimination, and distractor efficiency. We
then examine whether existing QG evaluation approaches can effectively
distinguish these differences. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in
these approaches with respect to accurately assessing test item quality in
relation to student performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel QG
evaluation framework, QG-SMS, which leverages Large Language Model for Student
Modeling and Simulation to perform test item analysis. As demonstrated in our
extensive experiments and human evaluation study, the additional perspectives
introduced by the simulated student profiles lead to a more effective and
robust assessment of test items.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates two LLM-based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, showing DeepSeek R1 outperforms O3 Mini in accuracy and confidence scores, with notable strengths in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, but weaknesses in Respiratory Diseases. Ethical considerations are highlighted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance and reliability of LLM-based diagnostic tools in medical diagnostics, comparing their accuracy and confidence scores across various disease categories.

Method: Evaluation of DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses, measuring predictive accuracy at disease and category levels, and analyzing confidence scores.

Result: DeepSeek R1 achieved higher accuracy (76% disease-level, 82% overall) and confidence (92% high-confidence predictions) than O3 Mini (72%, 75%, 68%). Both struggled with Respiratory Diseases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and limitations of LLM-based diagnostics, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations and future improvements in AI-driven healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing medical diagnostics by
enhancing both disease classification and clinical decision-making. In this
study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek
R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We
assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as
well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a
disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3
Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1
demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders,
and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in
Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however,
struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only
40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of
confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence
predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical
considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are
also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical
practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and
limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future
enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.

*Bryan Wilie, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Junxian He, Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs show inconsistent cross-lingual alignments. A new framework and ILO score quantify alignment, revealing that single-language fine-tuning disrupts early layers, while freezing them preserves alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether multilingual LLMs develop unified interlingual representations or partially aligned constructs, given mixed evidence.

Method: Analyzed 31 diverse languages, proposed an interlingual representation framework, and introduced the ILO score to measure alignment. Tested the impact of single-language fine-tuning.

Result: Single-language fine-tuning disrupts alignment in early layers; freezing these layers preserves alignment and improves cross-lingual generalization.

Conclusion: Interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning, validated by the proposed framework and ILO metric.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive multilingual datasets hint at
the formation of interlingual constructs--a shared subspace in the
representation space. However, evidence regarding this phenomenon is mixed,
leaving it unclear whether these models truly develop unified interlingual
representations, or present a partially aligned constructs. We explore 31
diverse languages varying on their resource-levels, typologies, and
geographical regions; and find that multilingual LLMs exhibit inconsistent
cross-lingual alignments. To address this, we propose an interlingual
representation framework identifying both the shared interlingual semantic
subspace and fragmented components, existed due to representational
limitations. We introduce Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify
interlingual alignment by comparing the local neighborhood structures of
high-dimensional representations. We utilize ILO to investigate the impact of
single-language fine-tuning on the interlingual representations in multilingual
LLMs. Our results indicate that training exclusively on a single language
disrupts the alignment in early layers, while freezing these layers preserves
the alignment of interlingual representations, leading to improved
cross-lingual generalization. These results validate our framework and metric
for evaluating interlingual representation, and further underscore that
interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how humor-coated misinformation spreads and evades detection, highlighting the need for tools to analyze this phenomenon.

Method: Creation of the DHD dataset with humor-infused comments labeled by Satire Level and humor type, spanning multiple languages.

Result: DHD provides a structured resource for analyzing humor's role in misinformation, with established baselines for future research.

Conclusion: The work underscores the subtle impact of humor in spreading misinformation and encourages further research in this area.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of online discourse, misinformation increasingly
adopts humorous tones to evade detection and gain traction. This work
introduces Deceptive Humor as a novel research direction, emphasizing how false
narratives, when coated in humor, can become more difficult to detect and more
likely to spread. To support research in this space, we present the Deceptive
Humor Dataset (DHD) a collection of humor-infused comments derived from
fabricated claims using the ChatGPT-4o model. Each entry is labeled with a
Satire Level (from 1 for subtle satire to 3 for overt satire) and categorized
into five humor types: Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, and
Absurdity. The dataset spans English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their
code-mixed forms, making it a valuable resource for multilingual analysis. DHD
offers a structured foundation for understanding how humor can serve as a
vehicle for the propagation of misinformation, subtly enhancing its reach and
impact. Strong baselines are established to encourage further research and
model development in this emerging area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied impact of preference tuning on LMs' ability to handle culturally diverse queries.

Method: Introduces CARE, a resource with 3,490 culturally specific questions and 31.7k responses, used to train culturally aware LMs.

Result: Modest high-quality native preferences improve cultural awareness in LMs, outperforming larger generic datasets. Models with stronger initial cultural performance benefit more.

Conclusion: CARE enhances cultural awareness in LMs, highlighting disparities in model performance based on regional data access. The resource will be publicly available.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are typically tuned with human preferences to produce
helpful responses, but the impact of preference tuning on the ability to handle
culturally diverse queries remains understudied. In this paper, we
systematically analyze how native human cultural preferences can be
incorporated into the preference learning process to train more culturally
aware LMs. We introduce CARE, a multilingual resource containing 3,490
culturally specific questions and 31.7k responses with native judgments. We
demonstrate how a modest amount of high-quality native preferences improves
cultural awareness across various LMs, outperforming larger generic preference
data. Our analyses reveal that models with stronger initial cultural
performance benefit more from alignment, leading to gaps among models developed
in different regions with varying access to culturally relevant data. CARE will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/Guochry/CARE.

### [119] [TALE: A Tool-Augmented Framework for Reference-Free Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07385)
*Sher Badshah, Ali Emami, Hassan Sajjad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TALE is a tool-augmented framework for evaluating LLM outputs without static references, using dynamic evidence retrieval and synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static references for LLM evaluation are costly, unscalable, and incomplete, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: TALE employs an agent with tool-access to iteratively retrieve, synthesize, and refine external evidence for evaluation.

Result: TALE outperforms reference-based metrics and aligns closely with human evaluations on free-form QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: TALE enhances LLM evaluation reliability in dynamic, real-world scenarios by eliminating dependency on static references.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated
references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability,
and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework
to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike
conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on
LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities
that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively
generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines
subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static
references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks
show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for
measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect
agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM
evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static
references.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Meeseeks is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to follow multi-turn instructions with iterative feedback, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs' instruction-following are single-turn or lack self-correction, failing to reflect real-world iterative feedback scenarios.

Method: Meeseeks introduces an iterative feedback framework simulating human-LLM interactions, allowing models to self-correct based on requirement failures. It includes a 38-tag evaluation system across three dimensions.

Result: Meeseeks provides insights into LLMs' instruction-following in multi-turn scenarios, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: Meeseeks fills a critical gap in evaluating LLMs' iterative instruction-following, offering a realistic and comprehensive benchmark for real-world applications.

Abstract: The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications.
For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a
single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until
the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing
instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new
requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this
gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions
through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct
based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting
real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a
comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three
dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output
Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks
provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in
multi-turn scenarios.

*Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Magauiya Zhussip, Valentin Malykh, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis, Nikos Komodakis, Sergey Zagoruyko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReplaceMe is a training-free depth pruning method for transformers, replacing blocks with linear operations while maintaining performance, outperforming other training-free methods and competing with retraining-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify pruning in transformers without requiring additional training or fine-tuning, reducing computational overhead.

Method: Uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a linear transformation approximating pruned blocks, seamlessly merging it with remaining blocks.

Result: Achieves up to 25% pruning with ~90% performance retention on LLMs, outperforming training-free methods and competing with retraining-based ones.

Conclusion: ReplaceMe offers efficient, training-free pruning with minimal overhead, demonstrated by strong performance on LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that
effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while
maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to
conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or
fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is
used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks.
The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining
transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters.
Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other
training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art
pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural
modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe
achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original
model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps,
resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an
open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art
depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe.

*Xingjin Wang, Howe Tissue, Lu Wang, Linjing Li, Daniel Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores learning dynamics in Continual Pre-Training (CPT) for large language models, focusing on performance evolution and loss curves. It introduces a scaling law to predict loss and optimize hyper-parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how general and domain-specific performance evolves during CPT and to derive a predictive scaling law for loss and hyper-parameter optimization.

Method: Analyzes CPT loss curves, decouples distribution shift and learning rate annealing effects, and derives a scaling law combining these factors.

Result: The scaling law accurately predicts loss across training steps and learning rate schedules, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed scaling law provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing CPT, balancing general and domain-specific performance.

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to
apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we
explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language
models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance
evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation
losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes
the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described
by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We
derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction
of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules
(LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several
critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training
steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize
training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and
domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling
law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

Motivation: To address the challenges LLMs face in adapting to rapidly changing medical knowledge, ensuring reliable healthcare applications.

Method: Developed the DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution, evaluated seven LLMs, and tested mitigation strategies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: LLMs struggled with outdated and conflicting recommendations. Mitigation strategies improved performance, with combined methods yielding the best results.

Conclusion: Enhancing LLM robustness to temporal shifts is crucial for dependable clinical use. The DriftMedQA dataset supports further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential in the field of health
care, yet they face great challenges in adapting to rapidly evolving medical
knowledge. This can lead to outdated or contradictory treatment suggestions.
This study investigated how LLMs respond to evolving clinical guidelines,
focusing on concept drift and internal inconsistencies. We developed the
DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution and assessed the temporal
reliability of various LLMs. Our evaluation of seven state-of-the-art models
across 4,290 scenarios demonstrated difficulties in rejecting outdated
recommendations and frequently endorsing conflicting guidance. Additionally, we
explored two mitigation strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and
preference fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization. While each method
improved model performance, their combination led to the most consistent and
reliable results. These findings underscore the need to improve LLM robustness
to temporal shifts to ensure more dependable applications in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates prefix bias in LLM-based reward models trained on human preference data, revealing biases in racial and gender dimensions. It proposes a data augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored biases in reward models derived from human preference datasets, particularly prefix bias triggered by minor query variations.

Method: Introduces novel methods to detect and evaluate prefix bias, tests these on diverse datasets and reward model architectures, and proposes a data augmentation strategy for mitigation.

Result: Reveals significant biases in reward models across racial and gender dimensions, showing susceptibility regardless of architecture. The proposed mitigation strategy effectively reduces bias impact.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation to ensure fair and reliable reward models, contributing to fairness in AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

*Tai D. Nguyen, Long H. Pham, Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoLaw is a dynamic legal violation detection framework for LLMs, combining adversarial data generation and jury-inspired deliberation to improve compliance and accuracy in diverse legal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal evaluation benchmarks lack adaptability and fail to address regional legal nuances, limiting their utility in evolving regulatory landscapes.

Method: AutoLaw uses adversarial data generation and a jury-inspired deliberation process with ranked LLM-based jurors to simulate judicial decision-making.

Result: AutoLaw improves LLM discrimination and boosts violation detection rates across benchmarks (Law-SG, Case-SG, Unfair-TOS).

Conclusion: AutoLaw offers a scalable, context-aware solution for evaluating and enhancing LLMs in legally sensitive applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) in
fields like law necessitates frameworks that account for nuanced regional legal
distinctions, which are critical for ensuring compliance and trustworthiness.
Existing legal evaluation benchmarks often lack adaptability and fail to
address diverse local contexts, limiting their utility in dynamically evolving
regulatory landscapes. To address these gaps, we propose AutoLaw, a novel
violation detection framework that combines adversarial data generation with a
jury-inspired deliberation process to enhance legal compliance of LLMs. Unlike
static approaches, AutoLaw dynamically synthesizes case law to reflect local
regulations and employs a pool of LLM-based "jurors" to simulate judicial
decision-making. Jurors are ranked and selected based on synthesized legal
expertise, enabling a deliberation process that minimizes bias and improves
detection accuracy. Evaluations across three benchmarks: Law-SG, Case-SG
(legality), and Unfair-TOS (policy), demonstrate AutoLaw's effectiveness:
adversarial data generation improves LLM discrimination, while the jury-based
voting strategy significantly boosts violation detection rates. Our results
highlight the framework's ability to adaptively probe legal misalignments and
deliver reliable, context-aware judgments, offering a scalable solution for
evaluating and enhancing LLMs in legally sensitive applications.

*Wenjie Yang, Mao Zheng, Mingyang Song, Zheng Li, Sitong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning framework for machine translation, eliminating the need for expensive external supervision. SSR outperforms existing models and achieves state-of-the-art results when combined with COMET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and scalability issues of external supervision in training advanced MT-specific LLMs.

Method: Proposes a reference-free, online SSR RL framework using self-judging rewards, trained with 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B.

Result: SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing models, and SSR-X-Zero-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance in English-Chinese translation.

Conclusion: Self-rewarding mechanisms are effective and complementary to external supervision, offering insights into self-improving RL methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific
LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as
human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often
expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging
rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as
the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs,
e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks
from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR
with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B,
achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese
translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters
and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism
compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its
complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide
valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have
publicly released our code, data and models.

*Zinuo Li, Xian Zhang, Yongxin Guo, Mohammed Bennamoun, Farid Boussaid, Girish Dwivedi, Luqi Gong, Qiuhong Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriSense is a triple-modality LLM integrating visual, audio, and speech for holistic video understanding, featuring adaptive modality weighting and supported by a 2M-sample dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with fusing audio-visual-speech cues, limiting comprehensive video temporal understanding.

Method: TriSense uses a Query-Based Connector to adaptively reweight modalities and is trained on TriSense-2M, a dataset of 2M curated samples.

Result: TriSense shows robust performance under modality dropout and advances multimodal video analysis.

Conclusion: TriSense effectively integrates multiple modalities for video understanding, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and
auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist
passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music
plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous
processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often
struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their
capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we
present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic
video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and
speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that
adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling
robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of
available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce
TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated
via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes
long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad
generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimbaBench, a benchmark for African speech tasks, and the Simba model family, achieving top performance. It highlights gaps in speech technology resources for Africa's diverse languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Africa's linguistic diversity is underrepresented in speech technologies, hindering digital inclusion. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors systematically map Africa's speech datasets and technologies, creating SimbaBench. They then develop the Simba model family and evaluate performance across languages.

Result: Simba models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Analysis shows resource availability and dataset quality impact performance across languages.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for more inclusive speech technology resources in Africa and provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Africa's rich linguistic diversity remains significantly underrepresented in
speech technologies, creating barriers to digital inclusion. To alleviate this
challenge, we systematically map the continent's speech space of datasets and
technologies, leading to a new comprehensive benchmark SimbaBench for
downstream African speech tasks. Using SimbaBench, we introduce the Simba
family of models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple
African languages and speech tasks. Our benchmark analysis reveals critical
patterns in resource availability, while our model evaluation demonstrates how
dataset quality, domain diversity, and language family relationships influence
performance across languages. Our work highlights the need for expanded speech
technology resources that better reflect Africa's linguistic diversity and
provides a solid foundation for future research and development efforts toward
more inclusive speech technologies.

### [129] [Calibrating Pre-trained Language Classifiers on LLM-generated Noisy Labels via Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19675)
*Liqin Ye, Agam Shah, Chao Zhang, Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SiDyP improves classifier robustness against noisy labels from LLMs by refining them using a simplex diffusion model, boosting performance by ~7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional labeled dataset creation is costly, and LLM-generated labels, while cheaper, introduce noise that harms model generalization.

Method: SiDyP refines noisy labels by leveraging neighborhood label distribution in embedding space and iterative simplex diffusion.

Result: Performance of BERT classifiers improved by 7.21% (zero-shot) and 7.30% (few-shot) on LLM-generated noisy datasets.

Conclusion: SiDyP effectively enhances robustness to LLM-generated label noise, validated across various NLP tasks and LLMs.

Abstract: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and
expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs)
have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to
such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such
auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent
inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is
likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While
previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise
and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In
this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to
calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards
LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by
neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines
noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase
the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and
few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30%
respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive
benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is
available on Github.

### [130] [More Thinking, Less Seeing? Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21523)
*Chengzhi Liu, Zhongxing Xu, Qingyue Wei, Juncheng Wu, James Zou, Xin Eric Wang, Yuyin Zhou, Sheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how longer reasoning chains in multimodal models increase hallucination, introduces RH-AUC and RH-Bench for evaluation, and finds that larger models and training data types influence the balance between reasoning and perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between extended reasoning and hallucination in multimodal models, as longer reasoning chains reduce visual grounding.

Method: Introduces RH-AUC to measure perception accuracy with reasoning length and RH-Bench for evaluating reasoning-perception trade-offs.

Result: Larger models balance reasoning and perception better, influenced by training data types/domains rather than volume.

Conclusion: Joint evaluation of reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity is crucial for multimodal models.

Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate
extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as
multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes
with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to
drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language
priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced
focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically
study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a
model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to
evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also
release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal
tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and
hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a
better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is
influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall
volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that
jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

### [131] [CVC: A Large-Scale Chinese Value Rule Corpus for Value Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01495)
*Ping Wu, Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Yuwei Wang, Yiting Dong, Yu Shi, Enmeng Lu, Feifei Zhao, Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical Chinese value framework and a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) to address cultural bias in LLM alignment, showing improved performance in value boundaries and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM value alignment suffers from Western cultural bias and lacks scalable evaluation methods, especially for non-Western contexts like China.

Method: Developed a hierarchical value framework (3 dimensions, 12 core values, 50 derived values) and constructed CVC with 250,000+ annotated rules. Evaluated using scenarios and moral dilemmas.

Result: CVC-guided scenarios outperformed direct generation, with LLMs preferring CVC options in 70.5% of cases and human annotators aligning 87.5%. Also created 400,000 moral dilemma scenarios.

Conclusion: The work provides a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for LLM value alignment, emphasizing Chinese values and universality.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values
and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI.
Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias
and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore,
the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations
costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese
values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived
values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values
Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through
human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios
outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In
the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven
mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while
five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming
its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values.
Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that
objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization
across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking
framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing
Chinese characteristics. All data are available at

### [132] [GraphRAG-Bench: Challenging Domain-Specific Reasoning for Evaluating Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02404)
*Yilin Xiao, Junnan Dong, Chuang Zhou, Su Dong, Qian-wen Zhang, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphRAG-Bench is introduced to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models with challenging, domain-specific questions, diverse tasks, and a holistic framework, revealing insights into graph architectures and reasoning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of GraphRAG models lack comprehensive assessment of reasoning capacity improvements, relying on limited question-answering datasets.

Method: GraphRAG-Bench features college-level, domain-specific questions requiring multi-hop reasoning, diverse task types, and a holistic evaluation framework covering the entire GraphRAG pipeline.

Result: The benchmark demonstrates the utility of graph-based structuring in improving reasoning capabilities, revealing insights into graph architectures and retrieval efficacy.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench provides actionable guidance for the research community by quantifying the benefits of GraphRAG models and highlighting critical aspects of their performance.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing
recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by
structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex
reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely
on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions
and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity
improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce
GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\)
Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions
that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content
retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions
require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage.
The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice,
true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16
disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework.
GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG
pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer
generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence
of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to
GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based
structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals
critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning
capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

### [133] [BriefMe: A Legal NLP Benchmark for Assisting with Legal Briefs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06619)
*Jesse Woo, Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori, Ana Marasoviƒá, Kenneth Marino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIEFME, a dataset for evaluating language models in legal brief writing tasks like summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. While LLMs excel in summarization and guided completion, they struggle with realistic argument completion and case retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal brief writing is under-explored in Legal NLP. It requires understanding law and crafting persuasive arguments, skills not yet fully captured in language models.

Method: The authors created BRIEFME, a dataset with three tasks: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. They evaluated current LLMs on these tasks.

Result: LLMs perform well on summarization and guided completion but poorly on realistic argument completion and case retrieval.

Conclusion: BRIEFME aims to spur Legal NLP development to better assist legal professionals, highlighting current model limitations.

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

*Mikhail Salnikov, Dmitrii Korzh, Ivan Lazichny, Elvir Karimov, Artyom Iudin, Ivan Oseledets, Oleg Y. Rogov, Natalia Loukachevitch, Alexander Panchenko, Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs by analyzing their interpretations of historical events from conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, China). It introduces a dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints, revealing significant biases favoring specific narratives. Simple debiasing methods were ineffective, and label manipulation experiments showed models' sensitivity to attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and highlight the presence of geopolitical biases in LLMs, particularly in their interpretations of historical events with conflicting national perspectives, and to evaluate the effectiveness of debiasing methods.

Method: The study introduces a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting national viewpoints. It evaluates LLMs' responses, tests simple debiasing prompts, and conducts experiments with manipulated participant labels to analyze bias sensitivity.

Result: Findings reveal significant geopolitical biases in LLMs, favoring certain national narratives. Simple debiasing prompts had limited impact, and label manipulation experiments showed models' sensitivity to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The work underscores the presence of national narrative biases in LLMs, challenges the efficacy of simple debiasing techniques, and provides a framework and dataset for future research on geopolitical bias.

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

### [135] [SDE-SQL: Enhancing Text-to-SQL Generation in Large Language Models via Self-Driven Exploration with SQL Probes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07245)
*Wenxuan Xie, Yaxun Dai, Wenhao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDE-SQL enables LLMs to dynamically explore databases during inference, improving Text-to-SQL performance without relying on static context or in-context demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods limit LLMs by using static database info, preventing autonomous exploration. SDE-SQL addresses this by allowing dynamic interaction.

Method: SDE-SQL generates and executes SQL probes to iteratively retrieve and update database understanding, operating in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Achieves 8.02% relative improvement in execution accuracy on BIRD benchmark, setting a new SOTA for open-source models without SFT or ensembling.

Conclusion: SDE-SQL enhances LLM performance in Text-to-SQL tasks through dynamic exploration, with potential for further gains via SFT.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant science lacks domain-adapted NLP tools despite advancements in transformer models. PlantBert addresses this gap by providing a specialized solution for extracting structured knowledge from plant stress-response literature.

Method: PlantBert is built on DeBERTa, fine-tuned on annotated abstracts, and enhanced with linguistic post-processing and ontology-based normalization. It uses a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology.

Result: PlantBert shows strong generalization across entity types and demonstrates robust domain adaptation in low-resource fields. It enables high-resolution entity recognition in plant science.

Conclusion: PlantBert bridges a critical gap in agricultural NLP, offering a scalable framework for knowledge extraction and fostering innovation in computational plant science. The model is open-source to promote transparency and collaboration.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance German language processing by leveraging updated architectures and tailored datasets.

Method: Incremental training on a German corpus using Whole Word Masking, extended with Nystr√∂mformer and Longformer for long-context support.

Result: Achieved top performance in NER and text classification tasks, outperforming larger models.

Conclusion: GeistBERT sets a new SOTA for German NLP and is released under MIT license to support research.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-U1 is a unified framework for medical QA tasks, using reinforcement learning to improve performance and generalization across diverse formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified framework for high-quality medical QA tasks, despite recent advancements in LLMs, motivates the development of Med-U1.

Method: Med-U1 employs large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary rewards and a length penalty to optimize reasoning chains.

Result: Med-U1 outperforms specialized and proprietary models on Med-QA benchmarks and shows robust OOD generalization.

Conclusion: Med-U1 provides a scalable solution for medical QA, with insights into training, reasoning control, and reward design for LLMs.

Abstract: Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks,
including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and
complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for
delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress
in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their
ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely
unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust
reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from
MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure
large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward
functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With
multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and
verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly
improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing
even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1
demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.
Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain
length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.

*Abdullah Al Shafi, Rowzatul Zannat, Abdul Muntakim, Mahmudul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A structured disease-symptom dataset compiled from verified medical sources, presented in a binary tabular format, aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and support AI-driven health applications, with a focus on addressing gaps in Bangla-language datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the demand for reliable disease-symptom datasets for medical research, diagnosis, and AI applications, while addressing the lack of structured datasets for underrepresented languages like Bangla.

Method: Systematic compilation from peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical studies, and verified sources, structured in a binary tabular format (diseases vs. symptoms).

Result: A structured dataset useful for machine learning, clinical decision support, and epidemiological studies, with potential for multilingual applications.

Conclusion: The dataset bridges a gap in Bangla-language resources and highlights the need for region-specific disease inclusion and symptom association refinement for better diagnostics.

Abstract: Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research,
disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management
applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with
specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles
disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature,
and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through
analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and
disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were
included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal
sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the
first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms.
Each symptom cell contains a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether a
symptom is associated with a disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Thereby,
this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range
of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical
decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some
advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant
gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge
that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics
tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic
communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and
further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

*Rylan Schaeffer, Joshua Kazdan, Yegor Denisov-Blanch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper re-examines claims about the min-p sampling method, finding no evidence it outperforms baselines in quality, diversity, or trade-offs, contrary to the original study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the evidence supporting min-p sampling's superiority over existing methods.

Method: Reanalysis of human evaluations, NLP benchmarks, LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, and community adoption claims from the original paper.

Result: Min-p does not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or trade-offs; original claims were unsupported or misleading.

Conclusion: The evidence does not support min-p's claimed advantages over established sampling methods.

Abstract: Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs,
affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al.
2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM
Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior
quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p
sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's
recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection
for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of
the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the
original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human
evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and
described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p
did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between
quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original
paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,
and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve
over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP
benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the
number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported.
Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars)
were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised
adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the
original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity,
or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinBen is a multilingual, multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in the financial domain, introducing novel tasks and revealing gaps in current models' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for financial NLP are limited to monolingual and unimodal settings, failing to capture real-world complexity.

Method: Introduces MultiFinBen with tasks like PolyFiQA and OCR-embedded QA, using a dynamic difficulty-aware selection mechanism.

Result: Evaluation of 22 models shows struggles with complex cross-lingual and multimodal financial tasks.

Conclusion: MultiFinBen aims to advance transparent and inclusive progress in financial NLP.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress in
financial NLP and applications, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to
monolingual and unimodal settings, often over-relying on simple tasks and
failing to reflect the complexity of real-world financial communication. We
introduce MultiFinBen, the first multilingual and multimodal benchmark tailored
to the global financial domain, evaluating LLMs across modalities (text,
vision, audio) and linguistic settings (monolingual, bilingual, multilingual)
on domain-specific tasks. We introduce two novel tasks, including PolyFiQA-Easy
and PolyFiQA-Expert, the first multilingual financial benchmarks requiring
models to perform complex reasoning over mixed-language inputs; and EnglishOCR
and SpanishOCR, the first OCR-embedded financial QA tasks challenging models to
extract and reason over information from visual-text financial documents.
Moreover, we propose a dynamic, difficulty-aware selection mechanism and curate
a compact, balanced benchmark rather than simple aggregation existing datasets.
Extensive evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art models reveals that even the
strongest models, despite their general multimodal and multilingual
capabilities, struggle dramatically when faced with complex cross-lingual and
multimodal tasks in financial domain. MultiFinBen is publicly released to

### [143] [Fine-grained Image Retrieval via Dual-Vision Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16273)
*Xin Jiang, Meiqi Cao, Hao Tang, Fei Shen, Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval (FGIR), combining sample and feature adaptation to leverage pre-trained models without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FGIR methods overfit training data and lose pre-training knowledge, reducing generalization.

Method: DVA uses Object-Perceptual Adaptation for sample modification and In-Context Adaptation for feature adjustment, plus Discrimination Perception Transfer for knowledge distillation.

Result: DVA performs well on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DVA effectively balances retrieval efficiency and performance while leveraging pre-trained models.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

### [144] [A Strong View-Free Baseline Approach for Single-View Image Guided Point Cloud Completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15747)
*Fangzhou Lin, Zilin Dai, Rigved Sanku, Songlin Hou, Kazunori D Yamada, Haichong K. Zhang, Ziming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A view-free, attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network is proposed for single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC), outperforming state-of-the-art methods without image guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the necessity of image guidance in SVIPC and propose a strong baseline using only partial point clouds.

Method: An attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network with hierarchical self-fusion (cross-attention and self-attention layers) for feature integration.

Result: Superior performance to state-of-the-art SVIPC methods on the ShapeNet-ViPC dataset.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the necessity of image guidance in SVIPC and offer insights for multimodal learning development.

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to
reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a
single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains
largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for
SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that
only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical
self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers,
effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature
representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric
structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC
dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to
state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into
the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhang-VISLab.

### [145] [VLMInferSlow: Evaluating the Efficiency Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models as a Service](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15755)
*Xiasi Wang, Tianliang Yao, Simin Chen, Runqi Wang, Lei YE, Kuofeng Gao, Yi Huang, Yuan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLMInferSlow, a method to evaluate efficiency robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in black-box settings, addressing gaps in prior research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on VLMs focuses on accuracy, neglecting efficiency robustness, which is critical for real-time applications. Previous evaluations are impractical in ML-as-a-service settings.

Method: Proposes VLMInferSlow, combining fine-grained efficiency modeling for VLMs and zero-order optimization to find adversarial examples.

Result: VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with subtle perturbations, increasing computational cost by up to 128.47%.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of efficiency robustness in VLMs and provides a practical evaluation method for black-box scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world
applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their
accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of
many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency
robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency
robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model
architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service
settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we
propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness
in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained
efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order
optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that
VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations,
increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research
raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

### [146] [Class Agnostic Instance-level Descriptor for Visual Instance Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16745)
*Qi-Ying Sun, Wan-Lei Zhao, Yi-Bo Miao, Chong-Wah Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical method for instance-level region discovery using self-supervised ViT features, addressing challenges like object embedding and occlusions in image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unknown object categories and lack effective instance-level feature representation.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition of feature subsets from self-supervised ViT to model instance regions at different semantic scales.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three instance search benchmarks, effective for known and unknown object categories.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach provides a comprehensive and robust solution for instance-level image retrieval.

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image
retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of
effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly
supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor
performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the
feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region
discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical
fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature
subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the
various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The
hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and
occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features
derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation
for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains
effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on
three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods considerably.

*Ruoyu Wang, Tong Yu, Junda Wu, Yao Liu, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL) to improve Visual Language Navigation (VLN) by integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge without fine-tuning, addressing challenges like dynamic viewpoints and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods face issues with dynamic viewpoints, lack of domain knowledge in pre-trained models, and high computational costs of fine-tuning.

Method: WPCL integrates pre-trained VLM knowledge into perception without fine-tuning, enhancing object identification from dynamic viewpoints.

Result: WPCL outperforms baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, showing effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability.

Conclusion: WPCL offers a computationally efficient solution to VLN challenges, improving performance without fine-tuning pre-trained models.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of
Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments
based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing
methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely
on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when
using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN
domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results,
their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning
(WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM
knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our
method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental
cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown
that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which
validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextBraTS, the first multimodal dataset combining MRI volumes and textual annotations for brain tumor segmentation, and proposes a novel framework for text-guided segmentation, showing improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain tumor segmentation lacks multimodal datasets combining imaging and textual data, limiting exploration of text-image fusion methods.

Method: A novel baseline framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric segmentation, tested with various fusion strategies and templated text formulations.

Result: Significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy, demonstrating effective multimodal integration.

Conclusion: The TextBraTS dataset and proposed framework advance multimodal approaches in medical image segmentation, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced
methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation
from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have
revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance
segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive
dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual
annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal
approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first
publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI
volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020
benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline
framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric
medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various
text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach
demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy,
offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

*Akarshani Ramanayake, Nihal Kodikara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based 3D scene reconstruction method using LiDAR and deep neural networks improves boundary-level accuracy in dense urban traffic, enhancing collision detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current technologies lack precise 3D scene reconstruction for autonomous vehicles in dense traffic, especially for boundary-level accuracy.

Method: Uses LiDAR data and a deep neural network to create static Signed Distance Function (SDF) maps for 3D obstacle shapes.

Result: Preliminary results show improved collision detection in congested and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed SDF-based method offers a more efficient and detailed solution for 3D scene reconstruction in autonomous driving.

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies
struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows
autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or
2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing
the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions,
3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is
not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function
represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any
point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in
terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate
problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving
domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map
obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a
learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data
and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)
maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the
potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance
collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic
environments.

*Fatmah AlHindaassi, Mohammed Talha Alam, Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAM-Dehaze is an adaptive dehazing framework that improves image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities, outperforming benchmarks in PSNR, FADE, and mAP while reducing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fog degrades visual information for autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems, necessitating adaptive solutions for varying fog intensities.

Method: Uses a Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) to classify fog intensity and routes images through tailored CORUN branches (Light, Medium, Complex). Introduces an adaptive loss for balance between physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity.

Result: Improves PSNR by 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30%, increases mAP by 13 points, and cuts inference time by 20% on Cityscapes and RTTS benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADAM-Dehaze demonstrates the effectiveness of intensity-specific processing and integration with downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to
autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical
applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce
ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly
optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities.
A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as
light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes
the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each
tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model
coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and
preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark,
ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and
increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time
by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific
processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code

*Huaying Yuan, Zheng Liu, Minghao Qin, Hongjin Qian, Yan Shu, Zhicheng Dou, Ji-Rong Wen, Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemVid, a memory-enhanced RAG-based approach, improves long-video understanding by mimicking human cognitive memory, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lose information due to compression, and RAG methods are limited by query dependency. MemVid addresses these issues.

Method: MemVid memorizes video info, reasons about task needs, retrieves critical moments, and focuses on them. It uses curriculum learning (supervised + reinforcement learning).

Result: MemVid outperforms LVLMs and RAG methods on benchmarks like MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench.

Conclusion: MemVid offers an efficient and effective solution for long-video understanding by leveraging memory and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Efficient long-video understanding~(LVU) remains a challenging task in
computer vision. Current long-context vision-language models~(LVLMs) suffer
from information loss due to compression and brute-force downsampling. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate this issue, their
applicability is limited due to explicit query dependency. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce a novel memory-enhanced RAG-based approach called
MemVid, which is inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings. Our approach
operates in four basic steps: 1) memorizing holistic video information, 2)
reasoning about the task's information needs based on memory, 3) retrieving
critical moments based on the information needs, and 4) focusing on the
retrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's
memory-grounded reasoning capabilities while achieving optimal end-to-end
performance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins
with supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then
progressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through
reinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU
benchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench. In our experiments, MemVid
demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to both LVLMs and
RAG methods.

*Jiahao Wang, Hualian Sheng, Sijia Cai, Weizhan Zhang, Caixia Yan, Yachuang Feng, Bing Deng, Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoShot is a multi-shot framework for portrait video generation, enhancing identity consistency and content control without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require multi-shot video generation with identity consistency and flexible control, which existing single-shot pipelines lack.

Method: Proposes shot-aware position embedding in video diffusion transformers and trains on the PortraitGala dataset for multi-shot scenarios. Also extends to reference-based generation and long video synthesis.

Result: Achieves superior identity consistency and attribute-level controllability in multi-shot portrait video generation.

Conclusion: EchoShot is a scalable and effective foundational paradigm for multi-shot video modeling.

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic
workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However,
prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while
real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and
flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native
and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a
foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position
embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model
inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot
visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design
enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional
computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot
scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity
human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and
fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions.
To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference
image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with
infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves
superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in
multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework
demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video
modeling.

*Dominic Akt, Marco Peer, Florian Kleber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates binarization methods for Greek papyri, comparing traditional and DL approaches, and assesses their impact on writer identification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writer identification in Greek papyri is hindered by non-uniform backgrounds, requiring effective binarization to avoid learning irrelevant features.

Method: Traditional and DL binarization methods are compared, with DL models trained using custom data augmentation and different selection criteria. Performance is tested on DIBCO 2019.

Result: Data augmentation improves DL methods, and binarization quality strongly correlates with writer identification performance.

Conclusion: Effective binarization, especially with DL and augmentation, is crucial for accurate writer identification in historical documents.

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A
common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image
binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This
is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background
is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures.
We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning
(DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer
identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom
data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are
applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically
evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer
identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for
writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of
data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong
correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO
2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

*Abdolazim Rezaei, Mehdi Sookhak, Ahmad Patooghy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using reinforcement learning and vision-language models converts AIE camera images into text to preserve privacy while retaining scene relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy risks from AIE cameras in CAVs, as traditional methods like face blurring fail to fully protect against tracking via other features.

Method: Feedback-based reinforcement learning and vision-language models transform images into semantically equivalent text, refined iteratively for accuracy and privacy.

Result: Significant improvements: 77% increase in Unique Word Count and 50% in Detail Density over existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances privacy protection and semantic retention, outperforming traditional techniques.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

*Rim Assouel, Declan Campbell, Taylor Webb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how vision language models (VLMs) solve the 'binding problem' using symbolic mechanisms and identifies failures in these mechanisms as the cause of binding errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how VLMs bind features to represent objects, given their persistent failures in such tasks.

Method: Investigates emergent symbolic mechanisms in VLMs, focusing on a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme.

Result: Identifies symbolic mechanisms supporting binding in VLMs and traces binding errors to failures in these mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings reveal symbol-like processing in VLMs and suggest ways to address their binding failures.

Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together
to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to
distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image
containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language
models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,
content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are
employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially
relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.
Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in
VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that
binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken
together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like
processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent
binding failures exhibited by these models.

Motivation: To provide a reliable, radiation-free tool for pediatric pancreatic MRI segmentation, addressing a gap in this underserved domain.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 84 MRI scans with manual segmentation by radiologists, evaluated using DSC, HD95, and Cohen's kappa.

Result: DSC scores: 88% (controls), 81% (AP), 80% (CP). HD95: 3.98 mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), 15.67 mm (CP). Strong agreement between automated and manual volumes.

Conclusion: PanSegNet is the first validated DL solution for pancreatic MRI segmentation, with expert-level performance, freely available for collaborative research.

Abstract: Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep
learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children
with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls.
Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T
Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University
(2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients
diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general
radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior
pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance
(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W
scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)

### [157] [Moir√©XNet: Adaptive Multi-Scale Demoir√©ing with Linear Attention Test-Time Training and Truncated Flow Matching Prior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15929)
*Liangyan Li, Yimo Ning, Kevin Le, Wei Dong, Yunzhe Li, Jun Chen, Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid MAP-based framework combining supervised learning with a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) for improved image and video demoir√©ing, addressing nonlinear degradation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully remove moir√© patterns or produce overly smooth results due to limited model capacity and training data. Generative models struggle with nonlinear cases like demoir√©ing.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework: 1) supervised learning with linear attention TTT modules for RAW-to-sRGB demoir√©ing, and 2) TFMP to refine outputs by aligning with clean image distribution.

Result: The framework combines computational efficiency with generative refinement, improving restoration performance by restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively addresses nonlinear demoir√©ing challenges, outperforming traditional and generative methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

### [158] [Beyond Audio and Pose: A General-Purpose Framework for Video Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15937)
*Yosub Shin, Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoSync is a framework for video synchronization that avoids reliance on audio or specific visual cues, outperforming prior methods like SeSyn-Net under fair conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods depend on unreliable audio or visual cues, and benchmarks lack generality, hindering progress in video synchronization.

Method: VideoSync is feature-agnostic, tested on diverse datasets (single-human, multi-human, non-human), with a CNN-based model for offset prediction.

Result: VideoSync outperforms existing methods, corrects biases in prior work, and provides reproducible benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoSync advances video synchronization by improving generalizability and robustness for real-world applications.

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world
applications.

*Zhongchen Zhao, Chaodong Xiao, Hui Lin, Qi Xie, Lei Zhang, Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA), integrating ViTs' self-attention with Mamba2's structured mask to enhance global dependency and spatial adjacency modeling in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Mamba2 for improved performance in computer vision tasks by addressing global dependency and spatial adjacency modeling.

Method: Introduces a 2D polyline path scanning strategy to enhance Mamba2's structured mask, then embeds this into ViTs' self-attention mechanism. Includes theoretical analysis and an efficient algorithm for mask computation.

Result: PPMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in benchmarks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation, e.g., achieving 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on ADE20K.

Conclusion: PPMA successfully integrates ViTs and Mamba2, demonstrating superior performance in computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues
of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks.
Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in
computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability
of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its
significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly
modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this
paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the
self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,
harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we
first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D
polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,
polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among
image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the
structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we
embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,
enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and
segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our
proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K
semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/zhongchenzhao/PPMA.

*Jiawen Yang, Shuhao Chen, Yucong Duan, Ke Tang, Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HMUDA and LSB for domain adaptation between entirely distinct modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of UDA when source and target domains are from entirely different modalities.

Method: Introduces HMUDA and LSB, using a bridge domain, dual-branch architecture, feature consistency loss, and domain alignment loss.

Result: LSB achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LSB effectively enables knowledge transfer between distinct modalities in UDA.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [161] [LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15976)
*Jingwei Zhang, Xi Han, Hong Qin, Mahdi S. Hosseini, Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LBMamba introduces a locally bi-directional SSM block to avoid extra scans, improving efficiency and performance in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the computational inefficiency of bi-directional scans in Mamba-based vision methods while maintaining performance.

Method: Embed a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan, alternating scan directions every two layers in LBVim.

Result: LBVim outperforms in accuracy, mIoU, APb, APm, and integrates well with MambaMIL for WSI classification.

Conclusion: LBMamba offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off, validating its versatility across vision tasks.

Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting
recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a
linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its
unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous
states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision
methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward
scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a
full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,
eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To
eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM
block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward
selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on
LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan
directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra
backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural
images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers
a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,
LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K
classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic
segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection
dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance
learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.
Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method
achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,
1.67% better accuracy.

TL;DR: A novel method classifies microscopy images as time series using Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW) and attention-based pooling, achieving reliable performance in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopic pathology images are crucial for cancer diagnosis but underutilized in deep learning. This paper addresses their manual acquisition and weakly labeled challenges.

Method: Proposes classifying microscopy images as time series, using DTW to fit varying-length sequences to fixed-length targets and attention-based pooling for class prediction.

Result: Outperforms baselines, demonstrates stable results with various inference strategies, and validates contributions through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The approach advances medical image analysis by effectively utilizing microscopy images and achieving trustworthy performance.

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are
fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,
despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely
overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying
microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed
by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits
image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging
Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to
predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing
the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and
reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each
component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only
embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of
performance.

*Cong Wang, Zexuan Deng, Zhiwei Jiang, Fei Shen, Yafeng Yin, Shiwei Gan, Zifeng Cheng, Shiping Ge, Qing Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignViP is a novel SLVG framework using multiple fine-grained conditions (poses, 3D hands) via discrete tokenization, outperforming existing methods in video quality and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLVG methods rely on coarse conditions (e.g., skeletons), limiting video naturalness and expressiveness.

Method: SignViP integrates fine-grained conditions through a diffusion model, FSQ Autoencoder, and token translator for text-to-video generation.

Result: SignViP achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, coherence, and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: SignViP advances SLVG by leveraging fine-grained conditions and discrete tokenization for superior video generation.

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

*Connor Malone, Owen Claxton, Iman Shames, Michael Milford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial attacks on Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems, proposes an Adversarial Attack Detector (AAD) framework, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise robot navigation. The paper aims to address this by integrating AADs into the system.

Method: The study evaluates four common and four novel VPR-specific adversarial attacks, introduces an AAD framework, and tests it in a novel experiment paradigm.

Result: Adding AADs improves performance, e.g., reducing mean along-track error by ~50% with 75% True Positive and up to 25% False Positive rates.

Conclusion: AADs are essential for trustworthy navigation, and the paper provides quantitative design requirements for real-world systems.

Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence
against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous
consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively
analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception
tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We
then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector
(AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit
of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the
robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment
paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies
can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement
-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can
be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%
and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:
Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an
`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on
these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this
work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy
navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical geologic maps are vital for renewable energy and national security but digitizing them is labor-intensive.

Method: DIGMAPPER integrates deep learning models for layout analysis, feature extraction, and georeferencing, using in-context learning, synthetic data, and transformers.

Result: Evaluations on 100+ maps show high accuracy in feature extraction and georeferencing, with successful USGS deployment.

Conclusion: DIGMAPPER accelerates geospatial dataset creation, aiding critical mineral assessments and geoscientific applications.

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point
feature extraction, and reliable georeferencing performance. Deployed at USGS,
DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial
datasets, supporting national-scale critical mineral assessments and broader
geoscientific applications.

*Liangjing Shao, Linxin Bai, Chenkang Du, Xinrong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning improves self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing lighting variations and sparse textures in endoscopic scenes for better depth and ego-motion estimation.

Method: Three-step training process: optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition, and multiple transformation alignments, with parameter-efficient finetuning.

Result: Achieves 4-10% lower error on SCARED and Hamlyn datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques, offering a robust solution for endoscopic depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks
for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient
robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in
endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow
and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing
methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are
still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information
interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a
novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.
In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,
including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and
multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are
trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on
parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on
SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with
4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published

TL;DR: PAROAttention reorganizes visual attention patterns into block-wise structures to simplify sparsification and quantization, achieving efficient high-resolution image/video generation with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in visual generation leads to high costs; existing sparsification/quantization techniques struggle with low density and reduced bitwidths due to irregular attention patterns.

Method: Proposes PARO, a technique to reorganize attention patterns into hardware-friendly block-wise structures, enhancing sparsification and quantization.

Result: PAROAttention achieves lossless metrics and near-FP baseline results at lower density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (INT8/INT4), with 1.9x-2.7x speedup.

Conclusion: Reorganizing attention patterns (PARO) is an effective alternative to specialized sparsification/quantization, enabling efficient visual generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenBench, a new benchmark for open-vocabulary segmentation, and proposes OVSNet, a method that outperforms existing approaches on both traditional and new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for open-vocabulary segmentation fail to measure true comprehension of diverse concepts due to semantic overlap with training data.

Method: The authors propose OVSNet, which fuses heterogeneous features and expands the training space cost-free to improve segmentation.

Result: OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on existing datasets and the new OpenBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of OpenBench and OVSNet in advancing open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

TL;DR: STAR-Pose is a spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework for low-resolution video-based human pose estimation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos is challenging due to conventional methods requiring high-quality inputs or being computationally expensive.

Method: STAR-Pose uses a spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention for long-range dependencies and an adaptive fusion module with a CNN branch for local texture enhancement. A pose-aware compound loss optimizes for keypoint localization.

Result: STAR-Pose achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement in low-resolution (64x48) conditions and is 2.8x to 4.4x faster than cascaded approaches.

Conclusion: STAR-Pose effectively addresses the challenge of low-resolution video pose estimation with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality
inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits
their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a
spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for
video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal
Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently
captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an
adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture
enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented
super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural
features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than
optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing
approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely
low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster
inference than cascaded approaches.

Motivation: To demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI in automating complex tasks like computer vision system configuration, traditionally requiring human expertise.

Method: Extending SimpleMind with an LLM-based agent to interpret prompts, plan workflows, and configure tools for medical image analysis.

Result: The system autonomously configured, trained, and tested on 50 chest x-rays, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96 (lungs), 0.82 (heart), and 0.83 (ribs).

Conclusion: Agentic AI can autonomously perform planning and tool configuration, reducing reliance on data scientists in computer vision development.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer

x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)

trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

*Byung Hoon Lee, Wooseok Shin, Sung Won Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TD3Net improves lipreading by combining dense skip connections and multi-dilated convolutions, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TCN-based lipreading methods suffer from blind spots in the receptive field, leading to information loss about continuous lip movements.

Method: Proposes TD3Net, a backend architecture with dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions to eliminate blind spots.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on LRW and LRW-1000 datasets with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs.

Conclusion: TD3Net effectively models temporal continuity and diverse features, offering advantages for lipreading systems.

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework
with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip
movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend
architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted
in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been
introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,
thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,
their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss
regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the
receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal
densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip
connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend
architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind
spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.
Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly
available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that
the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower
floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.
Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes
diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting
notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub

### [172] [PR-DETR: Injecting Position and Relation Prior for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16082)
*Yizhe Li, Sanping Zhou, Zheng Qin, Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PR-DETR improves dense video captioning by injecting explicit position and relation priors into a detection transformer, enhancing localization and caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based methods for dense video captioning implicitly learn event locations and semantics, requiring large datasets and limiting performance.

Method: PR-DETR introduces position-anchored queries for scene-specific position prior and an event relation encoder for boundary relationship prior.

Result: The method shows competitive performance on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit position and relation priors significantly improve dense video captioning accuracy and coherence.

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and
caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the
transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,
event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on
the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn
the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of
training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects
the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to
improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the
one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the
scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as
position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate
the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event
relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event
boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the
semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental
results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet
Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

*Zhaoyi Wang, Jemil Avers Butt, Shengyu Huang, Tomislav Medic, Andreas Wieser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical coarse-to-fine approach fuses 3D point clouds and RGB images for dense 3D landslide displacement estimation, outperforming existing methods in coverage and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for landslide monitoring rely on sparse or non-3D displacement estimates, lacking comprehensive spatial coverage.

Method: A hierarchical partition-based approach combines 3D geometry and 2D image features, refining matches via geometric consistency and rigid transformations.

Result: Achieves high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy (deviations of 0.07m-0.25m), outperforming F2S3 in coverage.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring, extensible to other point clouds and tasks.

Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating
associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on
either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D
displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and
co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We
construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.
These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid
transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world
landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement
estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.
Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements
(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,
respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived
references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and
0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial
coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical
and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to
other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source
code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

*Yuan Zhang, Chun-Kai Fan, Tao Huang, Ming Lu, Sicheng Yu, Junwen Pan, Kuan Cheng, Qi She, Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoV automates visual prompt selection for LVLMs, improving performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual visual prompt design is challenging and sub-optimal; automation is needed.

Method: AutoV learns to select optimal visual prompts using a ranking-based training pipeline.

Result: AutoV boosts LVLM performance (e.g., 1.7% gain for LLaVA-OV, 1.9% for Qwen2.5-VL).

Conclusion: AutoV is an effective automated visual prompting method for LVLMs.

Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have
been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as
overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image.
However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and
time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual
prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose
\textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt
from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To
train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline
that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set
of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction
losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we
train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various
visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the
performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks.
For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on
LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU,
highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

*Xu Zhao, Chen Zhao, Xiantao Hu, Hongliang Zhang, Ying Tai, Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) is proposed for image denoising, addressing limitations of fixed single-input single-output Unet architectures and uniform frequency domain treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures lack multi-scale pixel-level representations and uniform frequency domain treatment, ignoring high/low-frequency noise differences.

Method: MADNet uses image pyramid inputs and an adaptive spatial-frequency learning unit (ASFU) with a learnable mask for frequency separation, along with a global feature fusion block in skip connections.

Result: Extensive experiments show MADNet outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods on synthetic and real noisy datasets.

Conclusion: MADNet effectively addresses multi-scale and frequency domain challenges in image denoising, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

*Chengyu Bai, Yuming Li, Zhongyu Zhao, Jintao Chen, Peidong Jia, Qi She, Ming Lu, Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastInit introduces a fast noise initialization method for video generation, eliminating iterative refinement and improving efficiency and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational cost and temporal inconsistency in video generation caused by iterative refinement methods like FreeInit.

Method: FastInit uses a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) to generate refined noise in a single forward pass, trained on a large-scale dataset of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise pairs.

Result: FastInit enhances video generation efficiency and quality, achieving high temporal consistency across frames in various text-to-video models.

Conclusion: FastInit offers a practical, efficient solution for video generation, with plans to release the code and dataset.

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: Integration of WHT in ResNet50 improves accuracy (79%) and reduces energy consumption (39 kJ) compared to baseline (66%, 25,606 kJ).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and classification accuracy in CNNs using signal processing transforms.

Method: Modified ResNet50 with WHT applied to early and/or late layers, tested on CIFAR-100 dataset.

Result: WHT integration boosted accuracy (74-79%) and drastically cut energy use (39 kJ vs. 25,606 kJ).

Conclusion: WHT is efficient and effective for energy-constrained CNNs.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the
trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and
classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100
dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late
layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ
per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient
and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepObjectLog learns object-centric representations from raw data using distant supervision, combining perceptual and symbolic reasoning for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems require object-level supervision or predefined decompositions, limiting flexibility. The goal is to learn object-centric representations directly from unstructured data.

Method: DeepObjectLog integrates a perceptual module for object extraction with a symbolic reasoning layer using probabilistic logic programming.

Result: Outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines in generalization tasks like unseen compositions, tasks, and object counts.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic approach effectively learns object-centric representations and generalizes well without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by
reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in
neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this
goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a
predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a
neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly
from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We
instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that
integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,
with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By
enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component
introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of
meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range
of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks,
and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaQAP is a no-reference IQA model using quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of subjective human perception and complex real-world image distortions in IQA.

Method: Pre-training CNNs on a quality-aware dataset, using a quality-aware loss function, and integrating a meta-learner for ensemble predictions.

Result: Achieved high PLCC and SROCC scores (e.g., 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD) and demonstrated generalizability in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: MetaQAP provides a robust, generalizable framework for IQA, advancing the field with valuable insights for future improvements.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of
applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human
perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study
proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these
challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The
model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss
function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an
ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.
Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,
KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional
performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman
Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,
0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing
IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the
generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721
to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The
ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing
substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the
meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only
addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a
robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing
the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable
insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEED-Bench-R1 for evaluating multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and proposes GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework, to improve answer correctness and reasoning coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods like GRPO lack rigorous evaluation for MLLMs and often sacrifice logical coherence for answer accuracy.

Method: GRPO-CARE uses a two-tiered reward system: a base reward for answer correctness and an adaptive consistency bonus for logical coherence, replacing KL penalties.

Result: GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark and framework to enhance interpretability and robustness in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DeepRep, a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation model for HSI inpainting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on spectral mode transforms, neglecting low-rank properties in other tensor modes. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: 3DeepRep performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three HSI tensor modes, using 3-directional TNN regularization and a learnable aggregation module.

Result: The method achieves superior inpainting performance on real-world HSI datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 3DeepRep effectively leverages multi-directional low-rank structures, offering a significant improvement over state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have
demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by
leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments
incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,
existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,
neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)
model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the
HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of
mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction
(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the
three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation
module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy, Multimodal Bidirectional Attack, for Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models to address their robustness against adversarial examples and improve cross-text transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RES models lack exploration of adversarial robustness, and existing attack methods fail for RES due to its multimodal structure. Practical scenarios involve diverse referring expressions, necessitating adversarial examples that generalize across varied textual inputs.

Method: The method introduces learnable proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly optimizes visual and textual modalities during attack generation, enhancing cross-text transferability.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing methods in effectiveness across multiple RES models and datasets.

Conclusion: The Multimodal Bidirectional Attack successfully addresses RES robustness challenges and improves adversarial example transferability across diverse textual inputs.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation
in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and
broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive
performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains
largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored
adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly
when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its
multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users
typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the
same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize
across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we
propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal
Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable
proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned
optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the
textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework
encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text
embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text
transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain
effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResFlow is a novel image restoration framework using deterministic continuous normalizing flows, improving efficiency and performance over stochastic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for image restoration treat degradation as stochastic, leading to inefficiency and complexity.

Method: ResFlow models degradation as a deterministic path with entropy-preserving flow paths and learns by matching the velocity field.

Result: ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results, completing restoration in fewer than four steps.

Conclusion: ResFlow offers a practical, efficient solution for image restoration, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded
low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing
generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based
models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation,
which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow,
a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a
deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the
degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the
uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation
process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented
degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves
the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer
than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow
achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks,
offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

### [185] [Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on Real-World Degradation Patterns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17027)
*Yiyang Tie, Hong Zhu, Yunyun Luo, Jing Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a TripleGAN framework to address challenges in modeling real-world degradation patterns for super-resolution (SR) tasks, outperforming existing methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture diverse real-world degradation patterns (e.g., blur, noise, color shifts) from low-resolution (LR) images, limiting SR model performance.

Method: The TripleGAN framework includes three GANs: FirstGAN narrows the blur domain gap, SecondGAN translates domain-specific blur and learns additional degradations, and ThirdGAN reconstructs LR images from pseudo-real data.

Result: Experiments on RealSR and DRealSR datasets show superior quantitative performance and sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns and synthesizes real-world degradation patterns, enabling high-quality SR reconstruction from real-world LR inputs.

Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily
relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and
modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only
real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When
synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on
degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise
characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit
degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone
cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the
significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two
strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing
the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs
domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and
learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real
data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR
images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate
that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while
maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The
proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR
observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation
characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior
performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

*Jiyao Wang, Xiao Yang, Hao Lu, Dengbo He, Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework (GAP) combines multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) and test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) for remote physiological measurement, addressing challenges like partial labeling and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing generalizability and personalization in remote physiological measurement, overcoming issues like partial labeling, environmental noise, and the gap between generalization and personalization methods.

Method: Disentangles face video data into invariant semantics, individual bias, and noise, using priors and observations in multiple modules for MSSDG and TTPA.

Result: Validated on six datasets and a new real-world driving dataset, showing effectiveness in simultaneous MSSDG and TTPA with minimal adjustments.

Conclusion: The GAP framework successfully bridges MSSDG and TTPA, offering a practical solution for multi-task remote physiological estimation.

Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote
physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these
metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial
labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile,
given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the
test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring,
while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is
significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for
MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in
biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled
information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and
noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were
applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based
on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization,
our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task
remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG
benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and
introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive
experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new
dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework using GANs and CNNs for accident detection in CCTV footage, achieving high accuracy (up to 95%) with models like FTCNN and VIT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising global car accident rates necessitate automated, efficient accident detection systems to enhance transport safety and emergency response.

Method: The framework combines GANs for data synthesis and CNNs (including FTCNN and VIT) for training. Data preprocessing includes resizing, enhancement, and normalization of video frames from YouTube.

Result: FTCNN and VIT achieved 94% and 95% accuracy, respectively, outperforming the baseline CNN (88%).

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time accident detection, paving the way for future intelligent surveillance and smart city applications.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of
the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient
traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised
monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting
excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising
statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation
and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying
accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the
scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model
training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from
YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image
normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned
Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best
for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%,
while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework
suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection
capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for
intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic
monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance
systems into emergency management systems.

### [188] [VideoGAN-based Trajectory Proposal for Automated Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16209)
*Annajoyce Mariani, Kira Maag, Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GAN-based approach generates realistic traffic trajectories from BEV videos, achieving fast training and inference while aligning with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex, multimodal trajectory distributions, prompting the use of GANs for better accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos to train a GAN, extracts trajectories via object detection and matching, and compares to diffusion models.

Result: Achieves realistic trajectories with 100 GPU hours training and <20ms inference, aligning with Waymo dataset metrics.

Conclusion: GANs are effective for generating accurate, efficient traffic trajectories, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

*Xinting Liao, Weiming Liu, Jiaming Qian, Pengyang Zhou, Jiahe Xu, Wenjie Wang, Chaochao Chen, Xiaolin Zheng, Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCoOp is a federated OOD-aware framework that improves robustness in vision-language models by using ID global, local, and OOD prompts, addressing performance-robustness trade-offs in federated prompt learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning approaches struggle with balancing performance and robustness, especially under OOD shifts, due to data heterogeneity among clients.

Method: FOCoOp employs ID global, local, and OOD prompts for class- and distribution-level separations, using bi-level robust optimization and semi-unbalanced optimal transport for calibration.

Result: Experiments show FOCoOp effectively captures heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness against OOD shifts.

Conclusion: FOCoOp successfully addresses the trade-off in federated prompt learning, improving reliability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

TL;DR: A survey on 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) addressing robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for degraded inputs in neural rendering methods like NeRF and 3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering models assume clean, high-resolution inputs, limiting robustness under real-world degradations like noise, blur, and weather artifacts.

Method: Formalizes degradation-aware rendering, identifies challenges (spatio-temporal consistency, ill-posed optimization), and categorizes recent methods integrating LLV into neural rendering.

Result: Highlights advancements enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions, with applications in autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics.

Conclusion: Positions 3D LLV as a key direction for robust 3D content generation and scene reconstruction in real-world environments.

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic
3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models
assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their
robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution
(LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging
field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision
tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal,
restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred
to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust
rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the
degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to
spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that
integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate
how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.
Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also
discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By
reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work
positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation
and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

*Heng Zhang, Zikang Wan, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncMapV2 is a novel unsupervised segmentation algorithm with exceptional robustness, outperforming SOTA methods under various corruptions without requiring robust training or supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human vision's robustness and adaptability inspire the need for AI algorithms that can segment visual cues accurately under noise without explicit training.

Method: SyncMapV2 uses self-organizing dynamical equations and random network concepts, enabling online adaptation without re-initialization for each input.

Result: SyncMapV2 shows minimal performance drop (0.01% mIoU) under digital corruption, significantly outperforming SOTA methods in noise, weather, and blur scenarios.

Conclusion: SyncMapV2 represents a breakthrough in robust, adaptive AI, paving the way for future intelligent systems that mimic human vision's continuous adaptability.

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

Result: Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various applications and domains compared to existing synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: RealDriveSim addresses scalability and realism gaps in synthetic datasets, offering a cost-effective solution for autonomous driving research.

Abstract: As perception models continue to develop, the need for large-scale datasets
increases. However, data annotation remains far too expensive to effectively
scale and meet the demand. Synthetic datasets provide a solution to boost model
performance with substantially reduced costs. However, current synthetic
datasets remain limited in their scope, realism, and are designed for specific

popular 2D computer vision applications but also their LiDAR counterparts,
providing fine-grained annotations for up to 64 classes. We extensively
evaluate our dataset for a wide range of applications and domains,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DETA++ is a noise-robust few-shot learning method using contrastive relevance aggregation and memory bank techniques to handle ID/OOD noise in task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods struggle with noise in support and query samples, leading to unreliable predictions. DETA++ aims to address this by improving task adaptation robustness.

Method: DETA++ employs CoRA for support sample weighting, clean prototype and noise entropy losses, a memory bank for clean region storage, LocalNCC for query predictions, and IntraSwap for prototype rectification.

Result: Extensive experiments show DETA++ effectively handles dual noises, improving reliability in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: DETA++ provides a robust solution for noise-affected few-shot learning, enhancing task adaptation and prediction reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

TL;DR: The paper explores dual thinking in vision, introduces an adversarial dataset, and evaluates AI models' performance in intuitive vs. logical processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study dual thinking in human vision and assess AI models' capabilities in intuitive and logical processing, especially for safety-critical applications.

Method: Introduces a novel adversarial dataset, conducts psychophysical studies, and analyzes errors in MLLMs, VLMs, and segmentation models.

Result: Shows early stopping in visual processing can miss information; MLLMs/VLMs improve intuitive but lag in logical processing; segmentation models mimic human intuitive errors.

Conclusion: Enhancing logical processing in AI is crucial for safety-critical applications, ensuring robustness and reliability beyond scaling-based approaches.

Abstract: The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical
processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where
inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is
under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to
provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also
facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our
psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid
succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual
processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large
Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant
progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and
showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However,
their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their
advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit
errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack
understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to
sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based
systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous
driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential.
This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of
scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in
real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the transparency of neural networks in Writer Identification and Verification, aiding forensic experts by revealing the networks' decision-making processes.

Method: Two techniques are used: pixel-level saliency maps and point-specific saliency maps, evaluated with deletion and insertion score metrics.

Result: Pixel-wise saliency maps outperform point-specific maps and align well with forensic experts' focus areas.

Conclusion: Pixel-wise saliency maps are effective for supporting forensic experts in analyzing handwritten text similarities.

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer
vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification
(WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for
improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency
techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first
time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps,
while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide
information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are
evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support
forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to
explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification
process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are
compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification
process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps
outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of
forensic experts.

Conclusion: Suggests a shift toward raw data workflows for efficient and flexible image processing.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Raw Natural Image Noise Dataset (RawNIND), a
diverse collection of paired raw images designed to support the development of

linear RGB images for improved generalization to different sensors, with both
preserving flexibility for subsequent development. Both methods outperform
traditional approaches which rely on developed images. Additionally, the
integration of denoising and compression at the raw data level significantly
enhances rate-distortion performance and computational efficiency. These

TL;DR: MambaHash, a visual state space hashing model, leverages Vision Mamba for efficient large-scale image retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the suitability of Vision Mamba for large-scale image retrieval tasks, given its linear time complexity and strong performance in computer vision.

Method: Proposes a backbone network with grouped Mamba operations for local/global modeling, channel interaction attention for cross-channel communication, and adaptive feature enhancement for diversity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep hashing methods on CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and IMAGENET datasets, demonstrating efficiency and superior performance.

Conclusion: MambaHash effectively addresses large-scale image retrieval with Vision Mamba, offering a promising solution with open-source availability.

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by
mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural
networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted
extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on
various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale
image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose
a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a
backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation
is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to
perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel.
Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to
enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously
design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and
enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and
IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well
efficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diverse AIM (D-AIM) and EmoAgent, a multi-agent framework for generating diverse yet emotionally consistent image edits, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIM methods use rigid one-to-one emotion-to-visual mappings, failing to capture subjective and diverse human emotional perception.

Method: EmoAgent decomposes the process into three collaborative agents: Planning (diverse strategies), Editing (execution), and Critic (refinement).

Result: EmoAgent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotional fidelity and semantic diversity, generating multiple distinct edits for the same emotion.

Conclusion: EmoAgent successfully models one-to-many emotion-to-visual mappings, enabling diverse and emotionally accurate image manipulations.

Abstract: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) aims to alter visual elements within an
image to evoke specific emotional responses from viewers. However, existing AIM
approaches rely on rigid \emph{one-to-one} mappings between emotions and visual
cues, making them ill-suited for the inherently subjective and diverse ways in
which humans perceive and express emotion.To address this, we introduce a novel
task setting termed \emph{Diverse AIM (D-AIM)}, aiming to generate multiple
visually distinct yet emotionally consistent image edits from a single source
image and target emotion. We propose \emph{EmoAgent}, the first multi-agent
framework tailored specifically for D-AIM. EmoAgent explicitly decomposes the
manipulation process into three specialized phases executed by collaborative
agents: a Planning Agent that generates diverse emotional editing strategies,
an Editing Agent that precisely executes these strategies, and a Critic Agent
that iteratively refines the results to ensure emotional accuracy. This
collaborative design empowers EmoAgent to model \emph{one-to-many}
emotion-to-visual mappings, enabling semantically diverse and emotionally
faithful edits.Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate
that EmoAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both
emotional fidelity and semantic diversity, effectively generating multiple
distinct visual edits that convey the same target emotion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) to reduce computational costs in medical image segmentation by focusing on relevant tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs' high computational demands limit their practical use in medical image analysis. The goal is to improve efficiency by pruning irrelevant tokens.

Method: An adaptive prompt-guided pruning method ranks tokens by relevance, down-weights low-relevance ones, and propagates only relevant tokens. This integrates with state-of-the-art models for end-to-end training.

Result: The method reduces tokens by 35-55%, lowering computational costs while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables cost-effective, real-time medical image processing, making ViTs more viable in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a
huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing
medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method
to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation
pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to
their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring
that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent
stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training,
maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing
computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is
integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination
of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while
preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of
$\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the
baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework,
facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in
resource-constrained environments.

*Yunhao Hou, Bochao Zou, Min Zhang, Ran Chen, Shangdong Yang, Yanmei Zhang, Junbao Zhuo, Siheng Chen, Jiansheng Chen, Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGC-Drive is the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial-ground cooperative 3D perception, addressing the lack of data for UAV-involved collaborative scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work lacks focus on aerial perspectives (UAVs) in collaborative perception, and there's a scarcity of high-quality datasets for such scenarios.

Method: The dataset includes two vehicles and one UAV equipped with cameras and LiDAR, capturing 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images across 14 diverse driving scenarios.

Result: AGC-Drive provides benchmarks for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception, with fully annotated 3D bounding boxes for 13 object categories.

Conclusion: The dataset and toolkit aim to advance research in aerial-ground collaborative perception, offering tools for alignment, visualization, and annotation.

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps
autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception
accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial
perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to
alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major
reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground
collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first
large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The
data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five
cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and
a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception.
Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset
covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts,
highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic
interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane
changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and
fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide
benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative
perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we
release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification
tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation
utilities. The dataset and code are available at

*Santosh Patapati, Trisanth Srinivasan, Amith Adiraju*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modified CLIP model, CLIP-MG, is introduced for micro-gesture recognition, integrating pose-guided semantics and multi-modal fusion, achieving 61.82% Top-1 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gestures are subtle and involuntary, making recognition challenging in affective computing.

Method: CLIP-MG uses pose-guided semantic query generation and gated multi-modal fusion to adapt CLIP for micro-gesture classification.

Result: The model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82% on the iMiGUE dataset.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise but highlights challenges in adapting vision-language models for micro-gesture recognition.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining
difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture
recognition.

### [203] [HyperPath: Knowledge-Guided Hyperbolic Semantic Hierarchy Modeling for WSI Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16398)
*Peixiang Huang, Yanyan Huang, Weiqin Zhao, Junjun He, Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperPath leverages hyperbolic space and textual descriptions to model semantic hierarchies in WSIs, improving classification via geometry-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for WSI analysis rely on Euclidean embeddings, which inadequately capture semantic hierarchies. HyperPath addresses this by integrating textual knowledge and hyperbolic space.

Method: HyperPath adapts visual and textual features to hyperbolic space, using Angular Modality Alignment Loss and Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss for cross-modal alignment and hierarchy refinement. Classification uses geodesic distance.

Result: HyperPath outperforms existing methods in WSI classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperbolic embeddings.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embeddings, guided by textual knowledge, enhance WSI analysis by better modeling semantic hierarchies, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

*Dong Nguyen Tien, Dung D. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU models, highlighting the effectiveness of line-level and compound perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems under realistic adversarial perturbations, which remains understudied.

Method: A framework covering six gradient-based layout attack scenarios, manipulating OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts at word and line granularities with layout perturbation constraints.

Result: Line-level attacks and compound perturbations cause the most severe performance degradation; PGD-based BBox perturbations outperform random-shift baselines.

Conclusion: The study validates the impact of layout budget, text modification, and adversarial transferability, emphasizing the vulnerability of VDU models to carefully crafted attacks.

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance
in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals.
However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains
insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for
generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

involves predicting a house's 3D roof wireframe from a sparse point cloud and
semantic segmentations. Our method operates directly in 3D, first identifying
vertex candidates from the COLMAP point cloud using Gestalt segmentations. We
then employ two PointNet-like models: one to refine and classify these
candidates by analyzing local cubic patches, and a second to predict edges by
processing the cylindrical regions connecting vertex pairs. This two-stage, 3D
deep learning approach achieved a winning Hybrid Structure Score (HSS) of 0.43
on the private leaderboard.

Abstract: We investigate whether off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
can tackle Online Episodic-Memory Video Question Answering (OEM-VQA) without
additional training. Our pipeline converts a streaming egocentric video into a
lightweight textual memory, only a few kilobytes per minute, via an MLLM
descriptor module, and answers multiple-choice questions by querying this
memory with an LLM reasoner module. On the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark, our best
configuration attains 56.0% accuracy with 3.6 kB per minute storage, matching
the performance of dedicated state-of-the-art systems while being 10**4/10**5

*Riccardo Ziglio, Cecilia Pasquini, Silvio Ranise*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates CNN-based models for detecting face-swapping in videos, focusing on occlusion artifacts. While models perform well within the same dataset, they struggle with generalization across sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face swapping in videos is a growing threat due to advanced real-time tools, necessitating robust detection methods, especially for occlusion artifacts.

Method: Benchmarking CNN-based models on two datasets (one newly collected) to analyze generalization across sources and swapping algorithms.

Result: CNNs excel within the same dataset but fail to generalize occlusion-based cues across different sources.

Conclusion: Specialized detection strategies are needed to handle occlusion artifacts robustly in face-swapping detection.

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat
in remote video communications, due to advances
  in automated and real-time tools. Recent literature proposes to characterize
and exploit visual artifacts introduced in video frames
  by swapping algorithms when dealing with challenging physical scenes, such as
face occlusions. This paper investigates the
  effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking CNN-based data-driven models
on two data corpora (including a newly collected
  one) and analyzing generalization capabilities with respect to different
acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when
operating within the same data source, but a significant
  difficulty in robustly characterizing occlusion-based visual cues across
datasets. This highlights the need for specialized detection
  strategies to deal with such artifacts.

Method: Two-stage pipeline with a new shape foundation model (LATTICE) and PBR-based texture generation via a multi-view architecture.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in shape and texture generation, producing clean, smooth, and detailed 3D assets.

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D 2.5 sets a new benchmark for high-fidelity 3D asset generation.

Abstract: In this report, we present Hunyuan3D 2.5, a robust suite of 3D diffusion
models aimed at generating high-fidelity and detailed textured 3D assets.
Hunyuan3D 2.5 follows two-stages pipeline of its previous version Hunyuan3D
2.0, while demonstrating substantial advancements in both shape and texture
generation. In terms of shape generation, we introduce a new shape foundation
model -- LATTICE, which is trained with scaled high-quality datasets,
model-size, and compute. Our largest model reaches 10B parameters and generates
sharp and detailed 3D shape with precise image-3D following while keeping mesh
surface clean and smooth, significantly closing the gap between generated and
handcrafted 3D shapes. In terms of texture generation, it is upgraded with
phyiscal-based rendering (PBR) via a novel multi-view architecture extended

### [209] [How Hard Is Snow? A Paired Domain Adaptation Dataset for Clear and Snowy Weather: CADC+](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16531)
*Mei Qi Tang, Sean Sedwards, Chengjie Huang, Krzysztof Czarnecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC+ is a paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter, addressing the lack of realistic snowy and clear weather data for 3D object detection evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection is underexplored due to insufficient labeled data in both snowy and clear conditions, and synthetic data lacks realism.

Method: CADC+ extends the CADC dataset by pairing snowy sequences with clear weather sequences recorded on the same roads and period, minimizing domain shift.

Result: Preliminary results show snow introduces aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting as both noise and a distinct data domain.

Conclusion: CADC+ provides a realistic dataset for evaluating snow's impact on 3D object detection, revealing its dual role as noise and a unique domain.

Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains
underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient
labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same
driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do
not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or
rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data
often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds
accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first
paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter
conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset
(CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the
same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear
weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+
thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the
presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to
evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that
snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting
as both noise and a distinct data domain.

### [210] [From Semantic To Instance: A Semi-Self-Supervised Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16563)
*Keyhan Najafian, Farhad Maleki, Lingling Jin, Ian Stavness*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-self-supervised learning approach, GLMask, is proposed for instance segmentation with minimal manual annotation, achieving high performance in agriculture and general datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for large-scale pixel-level annotations in instance segmentation is labor-intensive, especially in agriculture with dense, occluded objects.

Method: GLMask focuses on shape, texture, and pattern while reducing color dependence. A pipeline converts semantic to instance segmentation.

Result: Achieves 98.5% mAP@50 for wheat head segmentation and 12.6% improvement on COCO dataset.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for precision agriculture and other domains with similar data challenges.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeTriage de-identifies patient facial videos for stroke diagnosis while preserving motion cues, using a pretrained VMT model and conditional generative model for adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and privacy challenges in AI-based stroke triage by de-identifying patient data without losing diagnostic relevance.

Method: Leverages a pretrained VMT model to transfer motion from real faces to synthetic identities, with a conditional generative model to adapt input space.

Result: Synthetic videos retain stroke-relevant facial patterns, ensuring reliable AI triage and robust privacy protection.

Conclusion: SafeTriage offers a secure, ethical solution for data sharing and AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians'
ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While
recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient
facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical
and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable
models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a
novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving
essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a
pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics
of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains
diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'
identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population
pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a
conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input
space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to
fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including
quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that
SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant
facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show
that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and
AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed three spatially aware metrics for uncertainty evaluation in segmentation, improving alignment with clinical factors and distinguishing meaningful uncertainty patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty metrics ignore spatial context and anatomical structure, leading to identical scores for distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs. boundary-aligned uncertainty).

Method: Developed three spatially aware metrics incorporating structural and boundary information, validated on prostate zonal segmentation data from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon.

Result: Improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Conclusion: Spatially aware metrics enhance uncertainty evaluation by considering spatial context and anatomical structure.

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

*Ruiming Chen, Junming Yang, Shiyu Xia, Xu Yang, Jing Wang, Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-LG extracts multimodal generalizable knowledge from CLIP, reducing computational costs and improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of pre-training CLIP at different scales and modalities by leveraging generalizable components efficiently.

Method: Uses multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract knowledge, initializes descendant models with these components, and evaluates performance.

Result: Achieves performance gains (e.g., +3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET) and reduces pre-training costs by ~2.8x with 25% parameter storage.

Conclusion: MM-LG is efficient and effective for diverse downstream tasks, outperforming existing approaches and reducing resource demands.

Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread
attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for
downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of
parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a
different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed
as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models
with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable
knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,
which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework
designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.
Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the
multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.
Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant
models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene
approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and
comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG
requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8
times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training
and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient
deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how synthetic captioning strategies affect text-to-image models, finding that dense captions improve alignment but may reduce aesthetics and diversity, while randomized-length captions balance these aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about synthetic captioning design choices and their impact on text-to-image model performance.

Method: Systematic investigation of different synthetic captioning strategies and their effects on model performance.

Result: Dense captions enhance alignment but may harm aesthetics and diversity; randomized-length captions balance these trade-offs. Caption distributions also influence output bias.

Conclusion: Caption design is critical for optimal model performance, and the study offers practical insights for better training data strategies.

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Result: The striped structure significantly enhances attack effectiveness, successfully misleading state-of-the-art systems and commercial cameras.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial patches are practical for real-world security assessments of stereo depth estimation systems.

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and
robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)
can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth
estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has
shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth
estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these
naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world
implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical
utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the
first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated
textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack
effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of
this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we
develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped
structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be
inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth
estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can
also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world
conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of
stereo systems.

### [218] [LaVi: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models via Internal Feature Modulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16691)
*Tongtian Yue, Longteng Guo, Yepeng Tang, Zijia Zhao, Xinxin Zhu, Hua Huang, Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaVi introduces a lightweight, adaptive transformation for efficient vision-language fusion in LVLMs, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs suffer from inefficient visual-language integration, disrupting model structure or increasing computational burden.

Method: LaVi uses internal feature modulation within LLMs, injecting vision-conditioned deltas into layer normalization parameters to align vision and language without long-context expansion.

Result: LaVi achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmarks, reducing FLOPs by 94%, improving speed by 3.1x, and halving memory usage compared to LLaVA-OV-7B.

Conclusion: LaVi offers a scalable, efficient solution for real-time multimodal reasoning, with code and models to be released.

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient
visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's
inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,
severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink
multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and
efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token
concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a
lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by
injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of
layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states
based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while
preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational
costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate
that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also
dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs
by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half
- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time
multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

*Xiaodan Hu, Chuhang Zou, Suchen Wang, Jaechul Kim, Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework leveraging language-driven common sense priors improves video action recognition in cluttered, occluded scenes by combining visual and textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize rich common sense priors in language models for understanding cluttered video scenes.

Method: Proposes a framework with three components: video context summary, description generation, and multi-modal activity recognition.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating language-driven common sense priors enhances video action recognition in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by
adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain.
However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts
that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object
interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this
paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense
priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that
are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component
that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between
objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the
current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through
auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity
recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video
actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
Action Genome and Charades datasets.

*Yunhan Ren, Feng Luo, Siyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD) to address GCD tasks with limited labeled samples and few known categories. A decision boundary enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval is proposed, outperforming existing methods on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD models lack exploration of performance with limited labeled samples and few known categories. FSGCD aims to address this gap.

Method: A decision boundary enhancement framework is introduced, featuring pre-training to mitigate overfitting and a two-stage retrieval-guided optimization strategy using affinity-based retrieval.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing methods on six public GCD benchmarks under FSGCD settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in GCD tasks, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved
significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small
number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming
to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known
information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary
enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed
to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these
boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary
pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on
known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries
using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided
decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further
enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved
pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown
clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on
six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:

### [221] [TeSG: Textual Semantic Guidance for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16730)
*Mingrui Zhu, Xiru Chen, Xin Wei, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeSG, a method for text-guided infrared and visible image fusion (IVF), leveraging textual semantics from Vision-Language Models to enhance fusion for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided IVF lacks effective integration of textual semantic information, limiting its utility for tasks like detection and segmentation.

Method: TeSG uses a Semantic Information Generator (SIG) to derive mask and text semantics, followed by Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) and Text-Driven Attentional Fusion (TDAF) modules for guided fusion.

Result: TeSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in downstream task performance.

Conclusion: TeSG effectively integrates textual semantics into IVF, improving fusion quality and downstream task applicability.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary
information from both image modalities, producing more informative and
comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due
to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and
utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask
semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual
descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on
this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image
fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is
optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.
Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information
Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven
Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics
based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based
fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask
semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated
attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on
downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Liu Zongzhen, Luo Hui, Wang Zhixing, Wei Yuxing, Zuo Haorui, Zhang Jianlin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDAF is a unified framework for weakly aligned UAV object detection, addressing semantic inconsistency and modality conflict through offset-guided alignment and dynamic fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving robustness in UAV object detection by tackling spatial misalignment and modality conflict in multimodal (RGB-IR) imagery.

Method: Proposes CoDAF with two modules: OSA for semantic alignment using deformable convolution and DAFM for adaptive fusion via gating and dual attention.

Result: Achieves 78.6% mAP on the DroneVehicle dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CoDAF effectively integrates alignment and fusion, enhancing UAV object detection performance.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in
applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve
robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible
(RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and
asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between
modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges:
semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict
during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in
isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal
Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that
jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.
CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),
which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution
guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the
Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances
modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via
spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a
unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on
standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF
achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

TL;DR: UAV-IP improves V-IP by integrating uncertainty quantification, boosting AUC by 3.2% and generating 20% more concise explanations without losing informativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V-IP methods ignore instance-level uncertainties, which can undermine trust and reliability in AI-driven medical decision-making.

Method: Introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a framework that quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in query-answer generation.

Result: Tested on four datasets (PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, SkinCon), UAV-IP achieves a 3.2% higher AUC and 20% more concise explanations than baseline V-IP.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware reasoning enhances interpretable AI models, making them more robust and reliable for medical applications.

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and
interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical
decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its
variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to
explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant
concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties
in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic
uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that
integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP
across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon,
demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating
20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing
informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware
reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical
decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module to detect diffusion-generated images by focusing on shared noise patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance even for unseen models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of diffusion models raises security concerns, necessitating robust detection methods that generalize to unseen models.

Method: Proposes NASA-Swin, integrating NASA into Swin Transformer, using cross-modality fusion (RGB and noise images) and a channel mask strategy.

Result: Demonstrates superior detection performance, especially for unseen diffusion models.

Conclusion: The NASA-Swin approach effectively addresses generalization challenges in diffusion-generated image detection.

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the
advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has
significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information
security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,
diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective
countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising
to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this
problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different
diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.
Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention
(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To
implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,
forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a
cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a
channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When
encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces INRFuse, an image fusion method using Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to combine infrared and visible light images, achieving superior results without needing a training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create fused images that retain thermal radiation from infrared and texture details from visible light, overcoming limitations of traditional pixel-based methods.

Method: Uses INR to parameterize a continuous function via neural networks, fusing features adaptively with multi-layer perceptrons and optimizing through multiple loss functions.

Result: INRFuse outperforms existing methods in visual quality and metrics, producing clear, natural, and information-rich fused images.

Conclusion: INRFuse is effective for multimodal image fusion, offering resolution independence and super-resolution capabilities without training data.

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both
modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual
or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based
on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method
parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly
represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the
traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized
spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,
and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both
modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple
loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused
image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation
information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the
visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of
INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and
achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate
queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing
methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,
producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich
information without the necessity for a training dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQCAD-DM combines Progressive Quantization and Calibration-Assisted Distillation to compress diffusion models efficiently without sacrificing generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally intensive and suffer from error accumulation, making naive compression ineffective.

Method: PQCAD-DM uses two-stage quantization (PQ) and calibration-assisted distillation (CAD) to reduce computational load while maintaining performance.

Result: PQCAD-DM halves inference time while matching full-precision performance, outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: PQCAD-DM offers a balanced solution for efficient and high-quality diffusion model compression.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,
outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

TL;DR: RealSR-R1 introduces VLCoT-GRPO, a framework combining vision-language reasoning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for realistic image super-resolution, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to accurately understand degraded images, leading to low-fidelity results. RealSR-R1 aims to improve this by integrating reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes VLCoT framework (inspired by Chain of Thought in LLMs) and GRPO with four reward functions: Format, Degradation, Understanding, and Generation rewards.

Result: RealSR-R1 generates realistic details and accurately understands image content, especially in complex or severely degraded scenes.

Conclusion: The VLCoT-GRPO framework effectively enhances Real-World Image Super-Resolution by combining reasoning and optimization, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in
image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate
understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that
are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which
empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models
(LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose
the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The
framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating
more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge
of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world
scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO
as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to
standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate
degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the
generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual
expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model
to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand
image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe
degradation.

*Riccardo Corvi, Davide Cozzolino, Ekta Prashnani, Shalini De Mello, Koki Nagano, Luisa Verdoliva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method improves AI-generated video detection by focusing on low-level artifacts and using wavelet-based data augmentation, enhancing generalization without large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video forensic detectors lack generalization, limiting real-world applicability. The paper aims to address this by focusing on intrinsic low-level artifacts rather than high-level flaws.

Method: The study identifies discriminative features across generative models and introduces a wavelet-based data augmentation strategy to train detectors on relevant forensic cues.

Result: The method significantly improves accuracy over state-of-the-art detectors, even on recent models like NOVA and FLUX, without needing large datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed training paradigm enhances detector generalizability by focusing on intrinsic artifacts, offering a simpler yet effective solution for AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can
produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually
indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors
have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which
limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to
overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really
matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on
identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative
architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize
a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative
architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are
unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a
novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet
decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model
to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves
the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for
complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic
generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a
single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of
other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent
results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and
data will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Co-VisiON benchmark to evaluate co-visibility reasoning in sparse image sets, revealing gaps between human performance and current vision models. A proposed multi-view baseline, Covis, narrows this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether current vision models match human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis, a critical skill in 3D vision and robotic perception.

Method: The Co-VisiON benchmark evaluates co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across 1000+ indoor scenarios. A novel multi-view baseline, Covis, is proposed.

Result: Existing vision models struggle with co-visibility under sparse conditions. A proprietary vision-language model outperforms vision-based approaches, but all lag behind humans. Covis narrows the gap.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for high-level reasoning in vision models. Covis shows promise, but further advancements are needed to match human performance.

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the
overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are
sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in
3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision
learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached
human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce
the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly
evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated
as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for
existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary
vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all
models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the
need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a
comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across
multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel
multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision
models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and
findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of
robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments. Our dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a unified LVLM integrating segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation in an end-to-end framework, outperforming disjointed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs treat visual understanding and editing separately, relying on disjointed models, which FOCUS aims to unify.

Method: FOCUS uses a dual-branch visual encoder, MoVQGAN-based tokenizer, and progressive multi-stage training with segmentation masks as spatial prompts.

Result: FOCUS achieves strong performance in multimodal understanding, referring segmentation, and controllable image generation.

Conclusion: FOCUS effectively bridges segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis, demonstrating joint optimization benefits.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising
capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling
both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current
approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either
perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as
conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple
disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM
that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric
generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual
encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained
spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to
produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable
accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage
training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as
spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns
visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging
segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive
experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding,
referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate
that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception
and generative capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing deepfake detection methods, which lack generalization or rely on complex architectures, by proposing a unified and efficient solution.

Method: Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and segmentation module with conditional queries, enabling global classification and fine-grained mask prediction. It also uses pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.846 score) on the DDL dataset, winning the IJCAI 2025 Challenge. Validates effectiveness in classification and localization under diverse forgery patterns.

Conclusion: Loupe's patch-level fusion and conditional query design improve accuracy and localization, offering a robust and efficient solution for deepfake detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to
supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset
demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the
first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge
with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both
classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery
patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/Loupe.

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning framework for robust ball detection in humanoid soccer robots, reducing reliance on manual annotations and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised ball detection methods require costly manual annotations, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: Uses a pretrained model for pseudo-labeling and self-supervised pretext tasks (colorization, edge detection, triplet loss) with MAML for rapid adaptation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, with faster convergence.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances ball detection while minimizing manual annotation effort.

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous
humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments
such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches
require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To
overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for
domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The
proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate
pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks
-- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust
visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid
adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset
comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is
introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms
baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting
faster convergence.

TL;DR: MICS introduces a novel method to generate rigorous medical CoT data, improving MLLM reasoning in medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for effective reasoning paths in medical diagnosis.

Method: MICS uses mentor-intern collaboration to search and evaluate reasoning paths, creating a ranked dataset (MMRP) and a new MLLM (Chiron-o1).

Result: Chiron-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MICS enhances medical MLLM reasoning, validated by superior benchmark results.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

*Sattwik Sahu, Agamdeep Singh, Karthik Nambiar, Srikanth Saripalli, P. B. Sujit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyTraverse is a framework for off-road traversability segmentation using natural language prompts and human-operator assistance, outperforming GA-NAV and Off-seg while reducing supervision needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks struggle with unstructured environments and lack adaptability for diverse robot types, limiting autonomous navigation in off-road scenarios.

Method: Combines natural language prompts with human-operator assistance, using zero-shot learning to avoid extensive data collection or retraining.

Result: Validated on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets, AnyTraverse outperforms GA-NAV and Off-seg, offering a vehicle-agnostic solution.

Conclusion: AnyTraverse balances automation with targeted human supervision, improving adaptability and performance in off-road traversability.

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

### [235] [Camera Calibration via Circular Patterns: A Comprehensive Framework with Measurement Uncertainty and Unbiased Projection Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16842)
*Chaehyeon Song, Dongjae Lee, Jongwoo Lim, Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unbiased projection model for circular patterns in camera calibration, addressing bias issues in existing models. It introduces centroid uncertainty to improve robustness and accuracy, outperforming checkerboard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection models for circular patterns are biased under lens distortion, leading to low performance. The paper aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: An unbiased projection model for circular patterns is introduced, along with centroid uncertainty to enhance calibration robustness. The method models boundary points as a Markov random field and propagates shape distribution to centroid uncertainty.

Result: The proposed framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to checkerboard-based calibration.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves camera calibration performance, with guidelines provided for optimal calibration. Source code and demonstrations are available.

Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two
types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the
corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is
derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise
measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of
circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.
To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the
circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the
checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular
patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid
uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including
pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide
guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation
metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a
two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.
The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an
appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the
resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and
robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at

*Chaonan Ji, Jinwei Qi, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang, Liefeng Bo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for video head swapping that preserves identity and allows expression editing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack holistic head morphology handling, struggle with hairstyles and backgrounds, and don't allow post-swap expression edits.

Method: Uses identity-preserving context fusion and expression-aware landmark retargeting within a latent diffusion paradigm.

Result: Achieves seamless background integration, robust identity preservation, and superior expression transfer for real/virtual characters.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses limitations of current head-swapping techniques with innovative strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition
controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a
human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the
original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak
head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing
face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting
holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with
hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow
users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle
these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through
a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We
propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground
head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair
enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation
across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark
retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting
module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the
impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression
editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to
minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background
integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as
showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real
and virtual characters.

*Shoubin Yu, Yue Zhang, Ziyang Wang, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEXA is a training-free framework for multimodal reasoning that dynamically selects and aggregates expert models based on input modality and task demands, achieving strong performance across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity in multimodal reasoning poses challenges for unified frameworks. MEXA addresses this by leveraging specialized expert models.

Method: MEXA dynamically selects expert models for specific modality-task pairs, generates interpretable textual reasoning, and aggregates outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM).

Result: MEXA outperforms baselines in benchmarks like Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA.

Conclusion: MEXA's modular, expert-driven approach enables flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning without additional training, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

*Jun Fu, Bin Tian, Haonan Chen, Shi Meng, Tingting Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Transformer-based end-to-end framework for autonomous parking learns from expert demonstrations, achieving high success rates and precision in simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based parking systems lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while human drivers park intuitively. This paper aims to bridge the gap by learning from human-like behavior.

Method: The proposed framework uses surround-view camera images, goal-point representations, ego motion, and pedestrian trajectories as inputs. It outputs control sequences via a Transformer with cross-attention and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor.

Result: The model achieves a 96.57% success rate in CARLA simulations, with low positional (0.21m) and orientation (0.41¬∞) errors. Ablation studies confirm the importance of key modules.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust performance in autonomous parking, leveraging human-like learning and dynamic obstacle modeling for safety and precision.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

*Fabian Gr√∂ger, Shuo Wen, Huyen Le, Maria Brbiƒá*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STRUCTURE, a method to align pretrained unimodal models with limited paired data, achieving strong performance in multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models require vast paired datasets, which are costly or impractical in many domains. This work explores alignment with minimal paired data.

Method: The method introduces STRUCTURE, a regularization technique preserving latent space geometry, and aligns layers with highest cross-modal similarity.

Result: Achieves significant improvements (51.6% in classification, 91.8% in retrieval) across 24 benchmarks with minimal data.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for limited-sample multimodal learning, offering a scalable solution for resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

*Annika Thomas, Robaire Galliath, Aleksander Garbuz, Luke Anger, Cormac O'Neill, Trevor Johst, Dami Thomas, George Lordos, Jonathan P. How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LunarLoc is a global localization method for lunar surface operations, using instance segmentation and graph-based terrain alignment to achieve drift-free, sub-cm accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous lunar operations require precise pose estimation without Earth-based navigation like GPS, especially for tasks like robotic exploration and regolith transport.

Method: LunarLoc uses instance segmentation to extract boulder landmarks from stereo imagery, constructs a terrain graph, and aligns it with a reference map using graph-theoretic data association.

Result: Achieves sub-cm accuracy in multi-session global localization, outperforming existing lunar localization methods.

Conclusion: LunarLoc provides a robust solution for lunar global localization, with publicly released datasets to foster further research.

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar
surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS,
is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the
Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks
such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as
excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but
proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry
drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important
for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on
autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To
help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an
approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for
zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment
detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,
which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a
previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables
accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings.
LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization
experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global
localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global
localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback
module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

*Fanfei Li, Thomas Klein, Wieland Brendel, Robert Geirhos, Roland S. Zimmermann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAION-C is introduced as a new benchmark for OOD robustness, addressing limitations of older benchmarks like ImageNet-C by including novel distortions not found in web-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like ImageNet-C are no longer effective for evaluating OOD robustness due to their corruptions being common in modern web-scale datasets, leading to unclear progress in model generalization.

Method: LAION-C is proposed with six novel distortion types designed to be OOD for web-scale datasets. State-of-the-art models, including MLLMs, are evaluated, and human robustness is compared via psychophysical experiments.

Result: LAION-C proves challenging for contemporary models, with top models now matching or surpassing human performance in OOD generalization.

Conclusion: LAION-C addresses the need for a modern OOD robustness benchmark, revealing a paradigm shift where models can now rival human robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

TL;DR: Defusion is an all-in-one image restoration framework using visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion, outperforming task-specific models for mixed or unknown degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models are limited to specific degradation types, lacking generalization for real-world mixed or unknown degradations.

Method: Defusion constructs visual instructions aligned with degradation patterns, guiding a diffusion-based model to denoise degradation effects.

Result: Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.

Conclusion: Defusion offers a generalized, stable solution for image restoration, handling mixed or unknown degradations effectively.

Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need
distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in
real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that
utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing
methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors,
Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the
visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying
degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation
features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual
instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the
degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the
degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world
degradations.

Abstract: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual
tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management

TL;DR: Prmpt2Adpt is a lightweight, zero-shot UDA framework using prompt-driven feature alignment and a teacher-student model for efficient domain adaptation in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing UDA methods, which rely on large models and full source data access, Prmpt2Adpt aims for practicality in low-resource environments like drones.

Method: Uses a distilled CLIP model as a frozen backbone for a Faster R-CNN teacher, aligns source features to target semantics via Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN), and fine-tunes the detection head. A student model is adapted using pseudo-labels from the teacher.

Result: Achieves competitive detection performance on MDS-A dataset, with 7x faster adaptation and 5x faster inference speed using few source images.

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt is a scalable, efficient solution for real-time domain adaptation in low-resource domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, addressing limitations of single-vehicle perception by leveraging shared information. It augments an existing dataset with dense occupancy annotations and benchmarks varying prediction ranges. A baseline model with inter-agent feature fusion outperforms single-agent models, especially at larger ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-vehicle perception is limited by occlusion, sensor range, and viewpoints. Collaborative perception can enhance completeness and accuracy by exchanging complementary information.

Method: Augment an existing dataset with dense semantic voxel annotations in CARLA, establish benchmarks for varying prediction ranges, and develop a baseline model using spatial alignment and attention aggregation for inter-agent feature fusion.

Result: The baseline model consistently outperforms single-agent models, with greater improvements as the prediction range increases.

Conclusion: Collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction improves perception in autonomous driving, with demonstrated benefits over single-agent approaches, particularly for larger spatial extents.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in
autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric
details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single
vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and
narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception
enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the
completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for
collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing
collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a
high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive
occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying
prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial
extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that
performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention
aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model
consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as
the prediction range expands.

### [246] [Stretching Beyond the Obvious: A Gradient-Free Framework to Unveil the Hidden Landscape of Visual Invariance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17040)
*Lorenzo Tausani, Paolo Muratore, Morgan B. Talbot, Giacomo Amerio, Gabriel Kreiman, Davide Zoccolan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SnS is a framework to study visual unit invariance and adversarial sensitivity in CNNs, revealing transformation-specific responses and robustness differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual units encode features and generalize, beyond just identifying exciting images.

Method: SnS uses bi-objective optimization to probe invariance (preserving activation) and adversarial sensitivity (suppressing activation) in CNNs.

Result: SnS uncovered transformation-specific responses (e.g., texture, pose) and showed robust CNNs produce more human-recognizable invariant images.

Conclusion: SnS provides insights into visual unit invariance and supports robust CNNs as better models of the visual system.

Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is
critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that
support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically
infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the
manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is
key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS),
an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically
characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames
these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe
invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the
representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while
preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks
perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit
activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image
variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those
produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target
unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically
depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:
pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching
mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.
Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by
human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher
fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

### [247] [Relaxed syntax modeling in Transformers for future-proof license plate recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17051)
*Florent Meyer, Laurent Guichard, Denis Coquenet, Guillaume Gravier, Yann Soullard, Bertrand Co√ºasnon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SaLT, a Syntax-Less Transformer, to address performance drops in license plate recognition caused by syntax shifts in new plates. It maintains accuracy on both past and future plates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based networks perform poorly over time due to syntax shifts in new license plates, making them unreliable for production.

Method: The authors analyze Transformer encoder-decoder flaws, propose architectural changes, and integrate them into SaLT for syntax-agnostic modeling.

Result: SaLT achieves top accuracy on past syntax and maintains performance on future plates, as shown in experiments on real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: SaLT's enhancements effectively address syntax dependency, proving robust in license plate recognition across varying syntaxes.

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to
constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While
Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we
observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for
tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art
results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they
perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters
are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the
flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,
we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,
we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,
an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license
plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show
that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly
nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate
the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

*Wang Zhao, Yan-Pei Cao, Jiale Xu, Yuejiang Dong, Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Assembler is a scalable framework for 3D part assembly using diffusion models and sparse anchor point clouds, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches in handling diverse, real-world objects with varying part counts and structures.

Method: Uses diffusion models for generative part assembly and a shape-centric representation with sparse anchor point clouds. Constructs a large-scale dataset for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and demonstrates high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects.

Conclusion: Assembler advances 3D part assembly and enables interactive, compositional design through its innovative framework.

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part
assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a
reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part
pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle
diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and
structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part
assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data.
First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs
diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing
ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid
assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on
sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space
rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of
over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering
pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate
high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we
further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates
high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for
interactive and compositional design. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAA-CAL, a novel learning system combining knowledge acquisition and accumulation with consistency-based active learning to improve multi-label driving scene identification, outperforming baselines and SOTA models with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing autonomous vehicles' contextual awareness by addressing challenges in multi-label classification for driving scenes, such as dataset imbalance and task learning balance.

Method: Uses KAA (knowledge acquisition and accumulation from single-label datasets) and CAL (consistency-based active learning to bridge knowledge gaps).

Result: Achieves a 56.1% performance increase over baseline, with KAA contributing 31.3% and CAL 24.8%. Outperforms SOTA models on BDD100K and HSD using 85% less data.

Conclusion: KAA-CAL effectively addresses multi-label classification challenges, improving driving scene identification performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class
labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing
autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the
complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is
better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a
multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through
multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,
comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across
different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes
knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active
learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates
knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via
monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap
caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual
attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene
Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the
baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the
gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best
performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two
public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The
DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGBTrack is a robust, real-time 6D pose estimation and tracking framework using only RGB data, eliminating depth input. It combines binary search, render-and-compare, and integrates 2D tracking with a Kalman filter for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of dynamic and precise object pose tracking without relying on depth data, simplifying hardware requirements.

Method: Uses a binary search strategy and render-and-compare with CAD models, integrates XMem 2D tracking, a Kalman filter, and a state machine for recovery. Includes a scale recovery module for unknown-scale CAD models.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance on benchmarks, suitable for robotics, AR, and computer vision.

Conclusion: RGBTrack is a practical, depth-free solution for real-time pose tracking, with potential applications in diverse fields.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation
and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for
depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building
on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy
combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and
generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable
tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions,
RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman
filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition,
RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale
using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern
generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves
competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical
solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality,
and computer vision.

*Md Sakibur Sajal, Marc Dandin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel watermarking technique using pgSPAD imagers is proposed, leveraging DSNU for source identification and tamper detection with a controllable trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods focus on CMOS and APS, leaving SPAD imagers unexplored. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Utilizes DSNU of 64x64 pgSPAD imager chips fabricated in 0.35Œºm CMOS to generate dynamic watermarks for test images.

Result: Achieves source identification and tamper detection with a controllable sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed pgSPAD-based watermarking is effective for security applications.

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the
imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing
variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few
demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors
(APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been
investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel
watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized
the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m
standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test
images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source
identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed
source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable
sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach is proposed to enhance performance with limited labeled data by leveraging complementary multi-modal information and contrastive mutual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inadequacy of semi-supervised learning in complex medical image tasks and the challenges of multi-modal fusion under semi-supervised conditions.

Method: Multi-stage multi-modal fusion and enhancement strategy, along with contrastive mutual learning to ensure prediction consistency across modalities.

Result: Superior performance and robustness demonstrated on two multi-modal datasets.

Conclusion: The framework shows valuable potential for solving medical image segmentation in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in
medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex
backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly
improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary
information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant
improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of
effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an
effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled
data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which
leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with
limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and
enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,
while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and
alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to
constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the
robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental
results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and
robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for
solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

### [253] [On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17137)
*Zhuonan Liang, Dongnan Liu, Jianan Fan, Yaxuan Song, Qiang Qu, Yu Yao, Peng Fu, Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for conditional feature alignment to address domain adaptation challenges in object counting, showing improved performance over unconditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard domain adaptation fails for object counting due to density shifts, which are task-relevant. The paper aims to address this by aligning features conditionally.

Method: The framework formalizes conditional divergence by partitioning domains into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and aligns distributions per condition. A joint error bound is derived to justify conditional alignment.

Result: Experiments on counting datasets show the method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, validating the theoretical insights.

Conclusion: Conditional feature alignment preserves task-relevant variations while filtering nuisance shifts, leading to superior cross-domain generalization for counting tasks.

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing
density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate
standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a
theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the
notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets
(e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then
derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as
condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on
the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These
insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving
task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve
superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining
conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a
practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in
unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with
varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms
existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the
theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

*Ritabrata Chakraborty, Rajatsubhra Chakraborty, Avijit Dasgupta, Sandeep Chaurasia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a text-based approach using LLMs for soccer action spotting, replacing traditional video-centric methods, and demonstrates its effectiveness on the SoccerNet Echoes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lightweight, scalable alternative to computationally expensive video-based action spotting by leveraging expert commentary and LLMs.

Method: Utilizes three specialized LLMs (outcome, excitement, tactics) to evaluate timestamped commentary from SoccerNet Echoes, identifying key actions like goals and cards.

Result: The language-centric approach effectively detects critical match events without training, offering a lightweight alternative to video-based methods.

Conclusion: Text-based action spotting using LLMs is a viable, efficient alternative to traditional video-centric approaches.

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

*Qing Xu, Yuxiang Luo, Wenting Duan, Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Seg++ is a framework for medical image segmentation that jointly performs semantic and instance segmentation, leveraging mutual enhancement between tasks for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat segmentation tasks in isolation, ignoring interdependencies, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Introduces a co-segmentation paradigm with a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) and multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) for joint semantic and instance segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CT and histopathology datasets for semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: Co-Seg++ effectively addresses interdependencies in segmentation tasks, improving medical image analysis.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly
segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures
and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated
different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental
interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation
performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this
issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic
and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise
a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial
and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as
prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative
decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the
contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance
segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology
datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts
in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical
structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking objects over time improves detection performance and aids downstream tasks like behavior classification and abundance estimation.

Method: Processes outputs from object detectors, tracks objects over time, and generates consensus detections from detector ensembles.

Result: A versatile tracker (yasmot) that works with various detectors and camera setups.

Conclusion: yasmot provides a practical solution for object tracking in image time series, enhancing detection and enabling advanced analysis.

Abstract: There now exists many popular object detectors based on deep learning that
can analyze images and extract locations and class labels for occurrences of
objects. For image time series (i.e., video or sequences of stills), tracking
objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object
detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including
classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we
present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the
output from popular object detectors and track objects over time from either
monoscopic or stereoscopic camera configurations. In addition, it includes
functionality to generate consensus detections from ensembles of object
detectors.

TL;DR: The paper proposes facial landmark box plots for dataset analysis and compares two facial landmark feature sets, finding neural networks outperform random forests in emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving emotion recognition from facial images by addressing the lack of thorough dataset analysis and visualization challenges.

Method: Introduces facial landmark box plots for outlier identification and compares absolute positions vs. displacements of landmarks for emotion recognition.

Result: Neural networks perform better than random forest classifiers in recognizing emotions from facial landmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed visualization and feature comparison enhance emotion recognition, with neural networks being more effective.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

TL;DR: Hunyuan-GameCraft is a framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in games, addressing limitations in dynamics, generality, and efficiency. It unifies inputs, uses hybrid training, and employs model distillation for real-time deployment, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video generation in games lack dynamics, generality, and efficiency, limiting gameplay video creation. Hunyuan-GameCraft aims to overcome these gaps.

Method: Unifies keyboard/mouse inputs into a shared camera space, uses hybrid history-conditioned training, and applies model distillation for efficiency. Trained on a large dataset of gameplay recordings.

Result: Outperforms existing models in realism and playability, with improved visual fidelity and action controllability.

Conclusion: Hunyuan-GameCraft advances interactive game video generation, offering high realism and playability for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFork, a Y-shaped architecture, balances shared learning and task specialization for unified image understanding and generation, outperforming fully shared Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The divergent modality alignment patterns in understanding and generation tasks create conflicts in fully shared Transformer backbones, leading to performance compromises.

Method: Analyzes modality alignment behaviors, then introduces UniFork with shared shallow layers and task-specific deeper branches.

Result: UniFork outperforms fully shared Transformer architectures and matches or exceeds task-specific models.

Conclusion: UniFork effectively resolves the conflict in unified models by balancing shared and task-specific learning.

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising
paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the
optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge.
In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of
task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as
current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:
understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment
across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better
comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality
alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to
recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a
fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform
representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.
Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture
that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while
employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.
This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.
Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork
consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,
and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated objects are common but challenging to model accurately in 3D reconstruction due to their complex structure and motion.

Method: Part$^{2}$GS uses a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation with learnable attributes and physics-based constraints (contact enforcement, velocity consistency, vector-field alignment) to ensure consistent motion. A field of repel points prevents part collisions.

Result: Part$^{2}$GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10√ó in Chamfer Distance for movable parts on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models articulated objects with high fidelity and physical consistency, setting a new benchmark for such tasks.

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable

TL;DR: InfGen is a unified model for long-term traffic simulation, combining closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulators focus on short-term closed-loop motion, lacking capability for long-term point-to-point trip simulation.

Method: InfGen uses a next-token prediction model to interleave closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation, switching modes automatically.

Result: InfGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in short-term (9s) simulation and excels in long-term (30s) simulation.

Conclusion: InfGen enables stable long-term traffic simulation and will be publicly released.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point
trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and
benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a
scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the
scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified
next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion
simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between
closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable
long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in
short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other
methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage enhances VLMs by using latent visual tokens for reasoning without explicit image generation, improving multimodal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with tasks requiring visual imagination due to text-only decoding. Existing methods using image-generation pre-training hinder reasoning.

Method: Mirage introduces latent visual tokens alongside text, supervised via distillation and reinforcement learning, avoiding pixel-level images.

Result: Mirage improves multimodal reasoning on benchmarks without generating explicit images.

Conclusion: Mirage enables stronger multimodal reasoning in VLMs by leveraging latent visual tokens, avoiding the limitations of explicit image generation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

*Jisu Nam, Soowon Son, Dahyun Chung, Jiyoung Kim, Siyoon Jin, Junhwa Hur, Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffTrack is a framework for analyzing how video diffusion models (DiTs) establish temporal correspondences, revealing key insights and enabling applications like zero-shot tracking and motion-enhanced video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how video diffusion models internally represent temporal correspondences across frames, which remains an open question despite their success.

Method: DiffTrack constructs a dataset with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes metrics to analyze the 3D attention mechanism in DiTs, focusing on layers, timesteps, and representations.

Result: Query-key similarities in specific layers are critical for temporal matching, becoming more prominent during denoising. DiffTrack achieves state-of-the-art in zero-shot tracking and improves video generation consistency.

Conclusion: DiffTrack provides insights into DiTs' temporal understanding, enabling further research and applications in video generation and tracking.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent
videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally
establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce
DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this
question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo
ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to
systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention
mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to
establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key
similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal
matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the
denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in
zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.
Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a
novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos
without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into
the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further
research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

*Zhangyang Qi, Zhixiong Zhang, Yizhou Yu, Jiaqi Wang, Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLN-R1 is an end-to-end framework using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) for continuous navigation, trained with GRPO-based methods and a two-stage approach (SFT and RFT), achieving strong results on VLN-CE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN systems rely on discrete graphs, limiting flexibility. VLN-R1 aims to enable continuous navigation using LVLMs for better adaptability.

Method: Leverages LVLMs to translate egocentric video into actions, uses GRPO-based training, and a two-stage approach (SFT for alignment, RFT with Time-Decayed Reward).

Result: VLN-R1 performs well on VLN-CE, demonstrating LVLMs' potential for embodied navigation and task-specific reasoning.

Conclusion: VLN-R1 shows LVLMs can effectively drive continuous navigation and improve reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,
requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language
instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on
discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node
connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams
into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by
DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego
dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling
to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can
supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level
control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with
expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced
with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights
multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong
performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied
navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,
reward-driven post-training.

than 350 km of recordings in nine different environments ranging from

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the performance gains of vision transformers, attributing them to spatial token mixers (STMs) and advanced network/block-level designs. A unified framework is introduced for fair comparison, revealing persistent performance differences among STMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the real contributions of convolution and attention operators in vision transformers, beyond novel feature transformations, by focusing on spatial feature aggregation (STMs).

Method: Introduces a unified architecture to neutralize network/block-level design differences, integrating various STMs for comparative analysis across tasks.

Result: Advanced network/block-level designs boost performance, but STMs still show differences in effectiveness, receptive fields, invariance, and robustness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of STMs and advanced designs in vision transformers, providing insights for future architecture improvements.

Abstract: Vision transformers have gained popularity recently, leading to the
development of new vision backbones with improved features and consistent
performance gains. However, these advancements are not solely attributable to
novel feature transformation designs; certain benefits also arise from advanced
network-level and block-level architectures. This paper aims to identify the
real gains of popular convolution and attention operators through a detailed
study. We find that the key difference among these feature transformation
modules, such as attention or convolution, lies in their spatial feature
aggregation approach, known as the "spatial token mixer" (STM). To facilitate
an impartial comparison, we introduce a unified architecture to neutralize the
impact of divergent network-level and block-level designs. Subsequently,
various STMs are integrated into this unified framework for comprehensive
comparative analysis. Our experiments on various tasks and an analysis of
inductive bias show a significant performance boost due to advanced
network-level and block-level designs, but performance differences persist
among different STMs. Our detailed analysis also reveals various findings about
different STMs, including effective receptive fields, invariance, and
adversarial robustness tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack representation of real-world autonomous driving scenarios with diverse conditions. The 4Seasons dataset fills this gap by providing data with seasonal, weather, and illumination variations.

Method: The benchmark uses a large-scale dataset (300+ km, nine environments) with centimeter-level accurate reference poses from stereo-inertial odometry and RTK GNSS fusion. It evaluates state-of-the-art visual odometry and localization methods.

Result: Evaluation of baseline approaches reveals insights into current methods and highlights potential for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel visual SLAM and long-term localization
benchmark for autonomous driving in challenging conditions based on the
large-scale 4Seasons dataset. The proposed benchmark provides drastic
appearance variations caused by seasonal changes and diverse weather and
illumination conditions. While significant progress has been made in advancing
visual SLAM on small-scale datasets with similar conditions, there is still a
lack of unified benchmarks representative of real-world scenarios for
autonomous driving. We introduce a new unified benchmark for jointly evaluating
visual odometry, global place recognition, and map-based visual localization
performance which is crucial to successfully enable autonomous driving in any
condition. The data has been collected for more than one year, resulting in
more than 300 km of recordings in nine different environments ranging from a
multi-level parking garage to urban (including tunnels) to countryside and
highway. We provide globally consistent reference poses with up to
centimeter-level accuracy obtained from the fusion of direct stereo-inertial
odometry with RTK GNSS. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art
visual odometry and visual localization baseline approaches on the benchmark
and analyze their properties. The experimental results provide new insights
into current approaches and show promising potential for future research. Our

### [268] [Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Segmentation via Conservative Propagation of Scene-level Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06799)
*Shaobo Xia, Jun Yue, Kacper Kania, Leyuan Fang, Andrea Tagliasacchi, Kwang Moo Yi, Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised method for semantic segmentation in point clouds uses scene-level labels to predict per-point labels by selectively propagating labels via unsupervised clustering and bipartite matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of dense per-point semantic prediction with only scene-level labels, reducing negative impacts of global label propagation.

Method: Over-segment point cloud features via unsupervised clustering, form primitives, associate scene-level labels with primitives through bipartite matching, and encourage narrow feature clusters.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ScanNet and S3DIS datasets by a large margin.

Conclusion: The proposed selective label propagation method effectively bridges the gap between scene-level labels and per-point predictions, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation method for point clouds
that predicts "per-point" labels from just "whole-scene" annotations. The key
challenge here is the discrepancy between the target of dense per-point
semantic prediction and training losses derived from only scene-level labels.
To address this, in addition to the typical weakly-supervised setup that
supervises all points with the scene label, we propose to conservatively
propagate the scene-level labels to points selectively. Specifically, we
over-segment point cloud features via unsupervised clustering in the entire
dataset and form primitives. We then associate scene-level labels with
primitives through bipartite matching. Then, we allow labels to pass through
this primitive-label relationship, while further encouraging features to form
narrow clusters around the primitives. Importantly, through bipartite matching,
this additional pathway through which labels flow, only propagates scene labels
to the most relevant points, reducing the potential negative impact caused by
the global approach that existing methods take. We evaluate our method on
ScanNet and S3DIS datasets, outperforming the state of the art by a large
margin.

*Soikat Hasan Ahmed, Jan Finkbeiner, Emre Neftci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid SNN-ANN architecture with attention and multi-timescale processing improves event-based object detection, combining SNN efficiency with ANN accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and dynamic range, but SNNs, while energy-efficient, lag behind ANNs in accuracy and flexibility.

Method: Proposes an Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbone with a bridge module for sparse-to-dense feature conversion and integrates DWConvL-STMs for multi-timescale dynamics.

Result: Outperforms SNN-based methods and matches ANN/RNN performance, with potential for neuromorphic hardware implementation.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture achieves ANN-like performance with lower latency, power, and parameter costs, advancing event-based detection.

Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range with minimal
motion blur, making them promising for robust object detection. While Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for
energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall
short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here,
we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object
detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel
Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal
relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the
ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates
DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale
network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense
RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by
significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based
methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the
SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of
our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic
hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural
choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance
at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel representation (eBFoV) for target localization in omnidirectional videos, proposes a dataset (360VOS) for tracking and segmentation, and benchmarks state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in visual object tracking and segmentation in 360¬∞ videos due to distortion and wide field-of-view.

Method: Proposes eBFoV for localization and a 360 tracking framework, along with a dataset (360VOS) for training and testing.

Result: Benchmarked state-of-the-art methods, showing the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset advance omnidirectional tracking and segmentation.

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation in omnidirectional videos are
challenging due to the wide field-of-view and large spherical distortion
brought by 360{\deg} images. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel
representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target
localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework
which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and
segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual
object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that
incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation
(360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense
pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support
both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the
dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120
sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional
tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive
experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Re-Face, a framework to revert facial retouching in photos, addressing geometric deformations and color shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of social media and retouching tools has increased photo beautification, challenging authenticity. Existing methods fail to revert geometric deformations.

Method: Re-Face includes a retouching detector, FaceR for image reversion, and H-AdaIN for color correction.

Result: Experiments show the framework's effectiveness in reverting retouched images.

Conclusion: Re-Face successfully addresses facial retouching reversion, including geometric and color issues.

Abstract: With the popularity of social media platforms and retouching tools, more
people are beautifying their facial photos, posing challenges for fields
requiring photo authenticity. To address this issue, some work has proposed
makeup removal methods, but they cannot revert images involving geometric
deformations caused by retouching. To tackle the problem of facial retouching
reversion, we propose a framework, dubbed Re-Face, which consists of three
components: a facial retouching detector, an image reversion model named FaceR,
and a color correction module called Hierarchical Adaptive Instance
Normalization (H-AdaIN). FaceR can utilize labels generated by the facial
retouching detector as guidance to revert the retouched facial images. Then,
color correction is performed using H-AdaIN to address the issue of color
shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and
each module.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new gradient-based XAI method, Guided AbsoluteGrad, is introduced for saliency maps, using gradient magnitudes and variance for noise reduction. A novel metric, RCAP, evaluates explanations. The method outperforms others in three case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve saliency map explanations by leveraging gradient magnitudes and reducing noise, while introducing a robust evaluation metric (RCAP) for better assessment.

Method: Guided AbsoluteGrad uses positive/negative gradient magnitudes and gradient variance for noise deduction. RCAP evaluates explanations based on Localization and Visual Noise Level objectives.

Result: Guided AbsoluteGrad outperforms seven gradient-based XAI methods in three case studies (ImageNet, ISIC, Places365) using RCAP and other metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances saliency map quality by effectively utilizing gradient magnitudes and introduces a reliable evaluation framework (RCAP).

Abstract: This paper proposes a new gradient-based XAI method called Guided
AbsoluteGrad for saliency map explanations. We utilize both positive and
negative gradient magnitudes and employ gradient variance to distinguish the
important areas for noise deduction. We also introduce a novel evaluation
metric named ReCover And Predict (RCAP), which considers the Localization and
Visual Noise Level objectives of the explanations. We propose two propositions
for these two objectives and prove the necessity of evaluating them. We
evaluate Guided AbsoluteGrad with seven gradient-based XAI methods using the

*Thomas Manzini, Priyankari Perali, Raisa Karnik, Mihir Godbole, Hasnat Abdullah, Robin Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study highlights non-uniform alignment errors between sUAS georectified imagery and building polygons, impacting robotics and HRI systems, and calls for new alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment errors in sUAS imagery negatively affect field robotics and HRI systems, yet prior work hasn't addressed this issue due to reliance on linear transformations for satellite imagery.

Method: Analyzed 21,608 building polygons in 51 orthomosaic images from the CRASAR-U-DROIDs dataset, measuring alignment errors and variances.

Result: Found non-uniform alignment errors (average circular variance 0.28, distance variance 0.45 pixels¬≤), making linear transforms ineffective.

Conclusion: The study raises awareness of spatial alignment challenges in sUAS imagery and contributes an updated dataset for further research.

Abstract: This work presents the first quantitative study of alignment errors between
small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) georectified imagery and a priori building
polygons and finds that alignment errors are non-uniform and irregular, which
negatively impacts field robotics systems and human-robot interfaces that rely
on geospatial information. There are no efforts that have considered the
alignment of a priori spatial data with georectified sUAS imagery, possibly
because straight-forward linear transformations often remedy any misalignment
in satellite imagery. However, an attempt to develop machine learning models
for an sUAS field robotics system for disaster response from nine wide-area
disasters using the CRASAR-U-DROIDs dataset uncovered serious translational
alignment errors. The analysis considered 21,608 building polygons in 51
orthomosaic images, covering 16787.2 Acres (26.23 square miles), and 7,880
adjustment annotations, averaging 75.36 pixels and an average intersection over
union of 0.65. Further analysis found no uniformity among the angle and
distance metrics of the building polygon alignments, presenting an average
circular variance of 0.28 and an average distance variance of 0.45 pixels2,
making it impossible to use the linear transform used to align satellite
imagery. The study's primary contribution is alerting field robotics and
human-robot interaction (HRI) communities to the problem of spatial alignment
and that a new method will be needed to automate and communicate the alignment
of spatial data in sUAS georectified imagery. This paper also contributes a
description of the updated CRASAR-U-DROIDs dataset of sUAS imagery, which
contains building polygons and human-curated corrections to spatial
misalignment for further research in field robotics and HRI.

*Sheng Miao, Jiaxin Huang, Dongfeng Bai, Weichao Qiu, Bingbing Liu, Andreas Geiger, Yiyi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDUS introduces a depth-guided method for efficient urban view synthesis from sparse images, outperforming existing methods in sparse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis require dense training images and extensive computation, limiting practicality.

Method: EDUS uses noisy predicted geometric priors to guide generalizable urban view synthesis, enabling robust performance with sparse inputs.

Result: EDUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse view settings and shows promising generalization on novel street scenes.

Conclusion: EDUS offers a practical solution for efficient and generalizable urban view synthesis, especially in sparse input scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in implicit scene representation enable high-fidelity street
view novel view synthesis. However, existing methods optimize a neural radiance
field for each scene, relying heavily on dense training images and extensive
computation resources. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce a new method
called Efficient Depth-Guided Urban View Synthesis (EDUS) for fast feed-forward
inference and efficient per-scene fine-tuning. Different from prior
generalizable methods that infer geometry based on feature matching, EDUS
leverages noisy predicted geometric priors as guidance to enable generalizable
urban view synthesis from sparse input images. The geometric priors allow us to
apply our generalizable model directly in the 3D space, gaining robustness
across various sparsity levels. Through comprehensive experiments on the
KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, we demonstrate promising generalization abilities
on novel street scenes. Moreover, our results indicate that EDUS achieves
state-of-the-art performance in sparse view settings when combined with fast
test-time optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DopQ-ViT improves Vision Transformer (ViT) quantization by addressing power-law distribution alignment and outlier issues, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computing costs and performance degradation in low-bit quantization of ViTs limit practical applications.

Method: Proposes DopQ-ViT with Tan Quantizer (TanQ) for power-law distribution alignment and MAD-guided Optimal Scaling Factor (MOSF) for outlier handling.

Result: DopQ-ViT outperforms previous post-training quantization methods in classification and detection tasks.

Conclusion: DopQ-ViT effectively addresses quantization challenges in ViTs, enhancing performance and practicality.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant attention, but their high
computing cost limits the practical applications. While post-training
quantization (PTQ) reduces model size and speeds up inference, it often
degrades performance, especially in low-bit settings. We identify two key
reasons for the performance degradation: 1) existing quantization methods fail
to align with the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations, and 2)
reparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations leads to a performance drop due to
the significant influence of outliers in the scaling factors. To address these
challenges, we propose DopQ-ViT, a Distribution-friendly and Outlier-aware
Post-training Quantization method for ViTs. First, DopQ-ViT introduces the Tan
Quantizer (TanQ), which better preserves the power-law distribution of
post-Softmax activations by focusing more on values near 1. Second, DopQ-ViT
presents the MAD-guided Optimal Scaling Factor (MOSF), which selects the
optimal scaling factor without introducing additional calculations. Extensive
experiments across various ViT models and quantization settings demonstrate
that DopQ-ViT, with the help of TanQ and MOSF, outperforms previous PTQ methods
on both classification and detection tasks.

*Ting Liu, Zunnan Xu, Yue Hu, Liangtao Shi, Zhiqiang Wang, Quanjun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MaPPER, a parameter-efficient framework for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), addressing inefficiencies of full fine-tuning by leveraging multimodal alignment and local visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning pre-trained models for REC breaks prior knowledge and is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) lacks domain-specific abilities for REC.

Method: MaPPER uses Dynamic Prior Adapters and Local Convolution Adapters for precise local visual perception, and a Prior-Guided Text module for cross-modal alignment.

Result: MaPPER outperforms full fine-tuning and other PETL methods on benchmarks, achieving top accuracy with only 1.41% tunable parameters.

Conclusion: MaPPER is an effective and efficient solution for REC, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual
region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal
alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to
transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full
fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge
embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs.
Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning
(PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient
manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate,
as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception
and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of
Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER.
Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by an aligned
prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for
better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to
further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment.
Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER
achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL
methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters. Our code is available at

*Suorong Yang, Peng Ye, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou, Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-powered data selection framework improves training efficiency and model performance by leveraging multimodal information to identify and remove noisy or redundant samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large datasets often contain redundant or noisy data, negatively impacting training efficiency and model performance. Existing methods rely on single-modality information, which may be inaccurate.

Method: Proposes a framework with three modules: dataset adaptation, sample scoring, and selection optimization, using multimodal pre-trained knowledge for robust sample selection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, removes noisy samples, and achieves higher performance with less data.

Conclusion: The framework not only accelerates training but also improves data quality, demonstrating the value of multimodal information in data selection.

Abstract: Large-scale datasets have been pivotal to the advancements of deep learning
models in recent years, but training on such large datasets invariably incurs
substantial storage and computational overhead. Meanwhile, real-world datasets
often contain redundant and noisy data, imposing a negative impact on training
efficiency and model performance. Data selection has shown promise in
identifying the most representative samples from the entire dataset, which aims
to minimize the performance gap with reduced training costs. Existing works
typically rely on single-modality information to assign importance scores for
individual samples, which may lead to inaccurate assessments, especially when
dealing with noisy or corrupted samples. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel CLIP-powered data selection framework that leverages multimodal
information for more robust and generalizable sample selection. Specifically,
our framework consists of three key modules-dataset adaptation, sample scoring,
and selection optimization-that together harness extensive pre-trained
multimodal knowledge to comprehensively assess sample influence and optimize
the selection results through multi-objective optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines on various benchmark datasets. Notably, our method
effectively removes noisy or damaged samples from the dataset, enabling it to
achieve even higher performance with less data. This indicates that it is not
only a way to accelerate training but can also improve overall data quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VDMoE, a multi-task Driver Monitoring System (DMS) using RGB video and rPPG to detect cognitive load and drowsiness in autonomous driving, with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for effective DMS in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving to mitigate risks like cognitive overload and drowsiness caused by human errors or automation.

Method: VDMoE leverages facial features and rPPG, optimizes the Mixture-of-Experts framework, and introduces prior-inclusive regularization for better performance.

Result: Validated on a new dataset (MCDD) and public datasets, VDMoE shows effectiveness in monitoring driver states.

Conclusion: VDMoE enhances safety in autonomous driving by accurately detecting driver states, with code and data to be released.

Abstract: Road safety remains a critical challenge worldwide, with approximately 1.35
million fatalities annually attributed to traffic accidents, often due to human
errors. As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges
still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if
they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if
driving was the sole task. This calls for the urgent need for an effective
Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness
in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts. In this study, we propose a novel
multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver
states non-invasively. By utilizing key facial features to minimize
computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for
physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while
maintaining efficiency. Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across
different tasks. A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to
align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and
mitigating overfitting risks. We validate our method with the creation of a new
dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42
participants, and two public datasets. Our findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of VDMoE in monitoring driver states, contributing to safer
autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released.

*Xiufeng Song, Xiao Guo, Jiache Zhang, Qirui Li, Lei Bai, Xiaoming Liu, Guangtao Zhai, Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-Det is a novel algorithm for detecting diffusion-generated videos, leveraging multi-modal models and attention mechanisms for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of synthesized videos from diffusion models threatens information security, but existing detection methods fail to address diverse semantic content.

Method: MM-Det uses Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) to generate Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR) and employs an In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) mechanism for feature augmentation. A dynamic fusion strategy refines forgery representations.

Result: MM-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset.

Conclusion: MM-Det effectively detects diffusion-generated videos, advancing video forensics with its multi-modal approach and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Large numbers of synthesized videos from diffusion models pose threats to
information security and authenticity, leading to an increasing demand for
generated content detection. However, existing video-level detection algorithms
primarily focus on detecting facial forgeries and often fail to identify
diffusion-generated content with a diverse range of semantics. To advance the
field of video forensics, we propose an innovative algorithm named Multi-Modal
Detection(MM-Det) for detecting diffusion-generated videos. MM-Det utilizes the
profound perceptual and comprehensive abilities of Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) by generating a Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR) from LMM's
multi-modal space, enhancing its ability to detect unseen forgery content.
Besides, MM-Det leverages an In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) mechanism for
feature augmentation in the spatio-temporal domain. A dynamic fusion strategy
helps refine forgery representations for the fusion. Moreover, we construct a
comprehensive diffusion video dataset, called Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF),
across a wide range of forgery videos. MM-Det achieves state-of-the-art
performance in DVF, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. Both
source code and DVF are available at https://github.com/SparkleXFantasy/MM-Det.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CVLM, a method to identify image features in X-rays that influence AI-generated reports, enhancing transparency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity and unreliability of AI-generated reports by clarifying which image features drive report changes.

Method: Proposes Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator (CVLM), which manipulates X-rays and reports cyclically to pinpoint critical features.

Result: CVLM identifies more precise features than existing methods, improving report transparency.

Conclusion: CVLM enhances the reliability and applicability of AI-generated reports by clarifying feature influences.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the
opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability
of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify
specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report
generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator
CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its
report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling
manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned
with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation,
achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison
between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features
driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability
of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can
identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation
methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of
AI-generated reports.

*Leonidas Gee, Wing Yan Li, Viktoriia Sharmanska, Novi Quadrianto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Visual Word Tokenizer (VWT), a training-free method to reduce energy costs in vision transformers while maintaining performance and runtime, making it suitable for real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of deploying vision transformers and the limitations of existing compression techniques (requiring fine-tuning or increasing runtime) hinder industrial adoption, especially for real-time inference.

Method: VWT groups frequently used visual subwords (image patches) into visual words, leveraging intra- or inter-image statistics for sequence compression without additional training.

Result: VWT reduces wattage by up to 25% with only a 20% runtime increase, outperforming 8-bit quantization and token merging in energy efficiency and runtime impact.

Conclusion: VWT is effective for efficient online inference with minimal performance compromise, offering a practical solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: The cost of deploying vision transformers increasingly represents a barrier
to wider industrial adoption. Existing compression techniques require
additional end-to-end fine-tuning or incur a significant drawback to runtime,
making them ill-suited for online (real-time) inference, where a prediction is
made on any new input as it comes in. We introduce the $\textbf{Visual Word
Tokenizer}$ (VWT), a training-free method for reducing energy costs while
retaining performance and runtime. The VWT groups visual subwords (image
patches) that are frequently used into visual words while infrequent ones
remain intact. To do so, $\textit{intra}$-image or $\textit{inter}$-image
statistics are leveraged to identify similar visual concepts for sequence
compression. Experimentally, we demonstrate a reduction in wattage of up to 25%
with only a 20% increase in runtime at most. Comparative approaches of 8-bit
quantization and token merging achieve a lower or similar energy efficiency but
exact a higher toll on runtime (up to 100% or more). Our results indicate that
VWTs are well-suited for efficient online inference with a marginal compromise
on performance.

*Shrisha Bharadwaj, Haiwen Feng, Giorgio Becherini, Victoria Fernandez Abrevaya, Michael J. Black*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenLit uses a video diffusion model (Stable Video Diffusion) to relight single images without explicit 3D reconstruction or ray tracing, achieving plausible results with minimal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inverse rendering for scene relighting is costly and complex. Recent visual foundation models offer a simpler, data-driven alternative.

Method: GenLit distills light manipulation capabilities from a graphics engine into a video-generation model, enabling direct point-light manipulation in images.

Result: The model generalizes to real-world scenes with convincing shadows, even when fine-tuned on a small synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: Video foundation models can effectively perform relighting without explicit 3D reconstruction, showcasing their potential for lighting and material understanding.

Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents
a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has
traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve
explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile,
recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm
could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with
networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this
paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model,
particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce
GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform
light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly
insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and
generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned
on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling
single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results
highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information
about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such
models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without
explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing. Project page:

*Guoxing Sun, Rishabh Dabral, Heming Zhu, Pascal Fua, Christian Theobalt, Marc Habermann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Double Unprojected Textures (DUT) for real-time, high-quality human rendering from sparse RGB inputs by disentangling geometry and appearance estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of sensor scarcity and tight time budgets in real-time human rendering, the paper aims to improve visual quality and robustness to unseen poses.

Method: DUT uses a two-step process: first, a coarse geometric deformation is estimated from an unprojected texture, then a second, more accurate texture unprojection refines the geometry and appearance using Gaussian splats.

Result: The method achieves robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: DUT effectively disentangles geometry and appearance, enabling high-quality real-time rendering from sparse inputs.

Abstract: Real-time free-view human rendering from sparse-view RGB inputs is a
challenging task due to the sensor scarcity and the tight time budget. To
ensure efficiency, recent methods leverage 2D CNNs operating in texture space
to learn rendering primitives. However, they either jointly learn geometry and
appearance, or completely ignore sparse image information for geometry
estimation, significantly harming visual quality and robustness to unseen body
poses. To address these issues, we present Double Unprojected Textures, which
at the core disentangles coarse geometric deformation estimation from
appearance synthesis, enabling robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in
real-time. Specifically, we first introduce a novel image-conditioned template
deformation network, which estimates the coarse deformation of the human
template from a first unprojected texture. This updated geometry is then used
to apply a second and more accurate texture unprojection. The resulting texture
map has fewer artifacts and better alignment with input views, which benefits
our learning of finer-level geometry and appearance represented by Gaussian
splats. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in
quantitative and qualitative experiments, which significantly surpasses other
state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

TL;DR: IllusionBench is a new dataset for evaluating VLMs on visual illusions, including classic and real-world scenarios, revealing performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VLMs focus on classical illusions, which SOTA models have mastered, but fail to address real-world illusions and hallucination issues.

Method: The authors introduce IllusionBench, a dataset with 1,051 images, 5,548 QA pairs, and golden descriptions, evaluating ten SOTA VLMs via true-or-false, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks.

Result: GPT-4o performs best but still lags behind humans, especially in semantic descriptions of trap illusions.

Conclusion: IllusionBench highlights VLMs' limitations in handling visual illusions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for future improvements.

Abstract: Current Visual Language Models (VLMs) show impressive image understanding but
struggle with visual illusions, especially in real-world scenarios. Existing
benchmarks focus on classical cognitive illusions, which have been learned by
state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, revealing issues such as hallucinations and
limited perceptual abilities. To address this gap, we introduce IllusionBench,
a comprehensive visual illusion dataset that encompasses not only classic
cognitive illusions but also real-world scene illusions. This dataset features
1,051 images, 5,548 question-answer pairs, and 1,051 golden text descriptions
that address the presence, causes, and content of the illusions. We evaluate
ten SOTA VLMs on this dataset using true-or-false, multiple-choice, and
open-ended tasks. In addition to real-world illusions, we design trap illusions
that resemble classical patterns but differ in reality, highlighting
hallucination issues in SOTA models. The top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves
80.59% accuracy on true-or-false tasks and 76.75% on multiple-choice questions,
but still lags behind human performance. In the semantic description task,
GPT-4o's hallucinations on classical illusions result in low scores for trap
illusions, even falling behind some open-source models. IllusionBench is, to
the best of our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for
visual illusions in VLMs to date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate slide generation, addressing the need for both content creation and visual planning skills.

Method: Introduces SlidesBench for evaluation, benchmarks image and program generation methods, and develops AutoPresent, an 8B Llama-based model trained on instruction-code pairs.

Result: Programmatic methods yield higher-quality slides; AutoPresent matches GPT-4o's performance; iterative refinement improves slide quality.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for future research in generating structured visuals.

Abstract: Designing structured visuals such as presentation slides is essential for
communicative needs, necessitating both content creation and visual planning
skills. In this work, we tackle the challenge of automated slide generation,
where models produce slide presentations from natural language (NL)
instructions. We first introduce the SlidesBench benchmark, the first benchmark
for slide generation with 7k training and 585 testing examples derived from 310
slide decks across 10 domains. SlidesBench supports evaluations that are
(i)reference-based to measure similarity to a target slide, and
(ii)reference-free to measure the design quality of generated slides alone. We
benchmark end-to-end image generation and program generation methods with a
variety of models, and find that programmatic methods produce higher-quality
slides in user-interactable formats. Built on the success of program
generation, we create AutoPresent, an 8B Llama-based model trained on 7k pairs
of instructions paired with code for slide generation, and achieve results
comparable to the closed-source model GPT-4o. We further explore iterative
design refinement where the model is tasked to self-refine its own output, and
we found that this process improves the slide's quality. We hope that our work
will provide a basis for future work on generating structured visuals.

*Tongxu Zhang, Bei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReLPU is a novel point cloud upsampling framework that learns global and local features via parallel autoencoders, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud upsampling is crucial for tasks like 3D reconstruction and object recognition, but existing methods lack feature completeness and cross-scale consistency, especially in sparse/noisy regions.

Method: ReLPU extracts global features from uniformly segmented inputs and local features from patch-based inputs, processes them through parallel autoencoders, fuses them, and uses a shared decoder for upsampling.

Result: Experiments show improved geometric fidelity, robustness, and interpretability, with saliency maps confirming the benefits of global-local learning.

Conclusion: ReLPU enhances point cloud upsampling by leveraging dual-input learning, offering better performance and interpretability for sparse/noisy data.

Abstract: In recent years, point cloud upsampling has been widely applied in tasks such
as 3D reconstruction and object recognition. This study proposed a novel
framework, ReLPU, which enhances upsampling performance by explicitly learning
from both global and local structural features of point clouds. Specifically,
we extracted global features from uniformly segmented inputs (Average Segments)
and local features from patch-based inputs of the same point cloud. These two
types of features were processed through parallel autoencoders, fused, and then
fed into a shared decoder for upsampling. This dual-input design improved
feature completeness and cross-scale consistency, especially in sparse and
noisy regions. Our framework was applied to several state-of-the-art
autoencoder-based networks and validated on standard datasets. Experimental
results demonstrated consistent improvements in geometric fidelity and
robustness. In addition, saliency maps confirmed that parallel global-local
learning significantly enhanced the interpretability and performance of point
cloud upsampling.

TL;DR: A novel method trains a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without human annotations, using a Local Object Motion Model, outperforming prior work and enabling scalable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object detection relies on costly LiDAR and human annotations, limiting scalability. This work aims to eliminate the need for domain-specific annotations and leverage abundant RGB data.

Method: Proposes a Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement between frames, compensates for camera focal length differences, and aggregates multiple datasets. It is 700x faster than previous methods.

Result: Evaluated on three public datasets, the method outperforms prior work without human labels and shows versatility as a pre-training tool, achieving accuracy comparable to human-labeled data.

Conclusion: The method enables scalable 3D object detection without human annotations, outperforms existing approaches, and is adaptable for pre-training and multi-dataset pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: Inferring object 3D position and orientation from a single RGB camera is a
foundational task in computer vision with many important applications.
Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised
setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are
laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of
data being captured.
  We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB
camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude
more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object
Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames,
is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera
focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets.
  The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no
human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows
its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows
that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable
accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset. The source code and model

TL;DR: A lightweight neural architecture for VSR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with only 2.3M parameters, balancing quality and compute for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tradeoff between reconstruction quality and computational resources in VSR for edge devices.

Method: Uses 2D wavelet decompositions, a single memory tensor for temporal info, and residual deformable convolutions for alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy with minimal parameters.

Conclusion: The model enables real-time VSR on edge devices, advancing deployment for streaming displays.

Abstract: The tradeoff between reconstruction quality and compute required for video
super-resolution (VSR) remains a formidable challenge in its adoption for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While transformer-based VSR
models have set new benchmarks for reconstruction quality in recent years,
these require substantial computational resources. On the other hand,
lightweight models that have been introduced even recently struggle to deliver
state-of-the-art reconstruction. We propose a novel lightweight and
parameter-efficient neural architecture for VSR that achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction accuracy with just 2.3 million parameters. Our model enhances
information utilization based on several architectural attributes. Firstly, it
uses 2D wavelet decompositions strategically interlayered with learnable
convolutional layers to utilize the inductive prior of spatial sparsity of
edges in visual data. Secondly, it uses a single memory tensor to capture
inter-frame temporal information while avoiding the computational cost of
previous memory-based schemes. Thirdly, it uses residual deformable
convolutions for implicit inter-frame object alignment that improve upon
deformable convolutions by enhancing spatial information in inter-frame feature
differences. Architectural insights from our model can pave the way for
real-time VSR on the edge, such as display devices for streaming data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeLib uses LLM priors to design 3D shape abstraction libraries, combining text descriptions and exemplar shapes. It validates abstractions via LLM workflows and trains recognition networks on synthetic data. The method generalizes well and supports downstream applications like shape editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of discovering reusable, interpretable abstraction functions for 3D shapes, leveraging LLMs for improved generalization and usability.

Method: ShapeLib combines LLM-guided workflows to propose and validate abstractions, trains recognition networks on synthetic data, and integrates geometric reasoning.

Result: ShapeLib outperforms prior works in generalization, usability, and plausibility, enabling applications like shape editing and generation.

Conclusion: ShapeLib successfully leverages LLMs for 3D shape abstraction, offering a scalable and interpretable solution with practical downstream benefits.

Abstract: We present ShapeLib, the first method that leverages the priors of LLMs to
design libraries of programmatic 3D shape abstractions. Our system accepts two
forms of design intent: text descriptions of functions to include in the
library and a seed set of exemplar shapes. We discover abstractions that match
this design intent with a guided LLM workflow that first proposes, and then
validates, different ways of applying and implementing functions. We learn
recognition networks that map shapes to programs with these newly discovered
abstractions by training on data produced by LLM authored synthetic data
generation procedures. Across modeling domains (split by shape category), we
find that LLMs, when thoughtfully combined with geometric reasoning, can be
guided to author a library of abstraction functions that generalize to shapes
outside of the seed set. This framework addresses a long-standing shape
analysis problem of how to discover reusable abstraction functions while
exposing interpretable, semantically aligned interfaces. We find that ShapeLib
provides distinct advantages over prior alternative abstraction discovery works
in terms of generalization, usability, and maintaining plausibility under
manipulation. Finally, we demonstrate that ShapeLib's abstraction functions
unlock a number of downstream applications, combining LLM reasoning over shape
programs with geometry processing to support shape editing and generation.

*Xiaojin Lu, Taoran yue, Jiaxi cai, Yuanping Chen, Cuihong Lv, Shibing Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSCA-Net, a novel network architecture, improves infrared small target detection by integrating multi-scale and attention mechanisms, achieving high mIoU scores on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny infrared targets is challenging due to low contrast, high noise, and inadequate integration of global and local information in existing methods.

Method: Proposes MSCA-Net with Multi-Scale Enhanced Dilated Attention (MSEDA), Positional Convolutional Block Attention Module (PCBAM), and Channel Aggregation Feature Fusion Block (CAB) to enhance feature representation and interaction.

Result: Achieves mIoU scores of 78.43%, 94.56%, and 67.08% on NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRTSD-1K datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: MSCA-Net demonstrates strong performance and potential for real-world applications in complex infrared target detection.

Abstract: In complex environments, detecting tiny infrared targets has always been
challenging because of the low contrast and high noise levels inherent in
infrared images. These factors often lead to the loss of crucial details during
feature extraction. Moreover, existing detection methods have limitations in
adequately integrating global and local information, which constrains the
efficiency and accuracy of infrared small target detection. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a network architecture named MSCA-Net, which
integrates three key components: Multi-Scale Enhanced Dilated Attention
mechanism (MSEDA), Positional Convolutional Block Attention Module (PCBAM), and
Channel Aggregation Feature Fusion Block (CAB). Specifically, MSEDA employs a
multi-scale feature fusion attention mechanism to adaptively aggregate
information across different scales, enriching feature representation. PCBAM
captures the correlation between global and local features through a
correlation matrix-based strategy, enabling deep feature interaction. Moreover,
CAB enhances the representation of critical features by assigning greater
weights to them, integrating both low-level and high-level information, and
thereby improving the models detection performance in complex backgrounds. The
experimental results demonstrate that MSCA-Net achieves strong small target
detection performance in complex backgrounds. Specifically, it attains mIoU

*Chengan Che, Chao Wang, Tom Vercauteren, Sophia Tsoka, Luis C. Garcia-Peraza-Herrera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset, Surg-3M, and a foundation model, SurgFM, are introduced to address limitations in surgical procedure datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surgical datasets are small and limited. Surg-3M and SurgFM aim to provide a larger, more comprehensive resource for computer-assisted surgical advancements.

Method: Surg-3M aggregates high-resolution surgical videos. SurgFM combines ConvNeXt, DINO, and augmented distillation for self-supervised pretraining.

Result: SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in surgical phase recognition, action recognition, and tool presence detection, even with reduced data.

Conclusion: Surg-3M and SurgFM significantly advance autonomous robotic surgery development.

Abstract: Advancements in computer-assisted surgical procedures heavily rely on
accurate visual data interpretation from camera systems used during surgeries.
Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often
limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos with
less than 100K images. To address these constraints, a new dataset called
Surg-3M has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects
high-resolution videos from online sources. Featuring an extensive collection
of over 4K surgical videos totaling 938 hours of high-quality footage across
multiple procedure types, Surg-3M offers a comprehensive resource surpassing
existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel tasks. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of this dataset, we present SurgFM, a
self-supervised foundation model pretrained on Surg-3M that achieves impressive
results in downstream tasks such as surgical phase recognition, action
recognition, and tool presence detection. Combining key components from
ConvNeXt, DINO, and an innovative augmented distillation method, SurgFM
exhibits exceptional performance compared to specialist architectures across
various benchmarks. Our experimental results show that SurgFM outperforms
state-of-the-art models in multiple downstream tasks, including significant
gains in surgical phase recognition (+8.9pp, +4.7pp, and +3.9pp of Jaccard in
AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), action recognition (+3.1pp of mAP in
CholecT50) and tool presence detection (+4.6pp of mAP in Cholec80). Moreover,
even when using only half of the data, SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art
models in AutoLaparo and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Cholec80.
Both Surg-3M and SurgFM have significant potential to accelerate progress
towards developing autonomous robotic surgery systems.

*Ben Lonnqvist, Elsa Scialom, Abdulkadir Gokce, Zehra Merchant, Michael H. Herzog, Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates why deep learning models lag behind humans in generalizing to new input distributions, focusing on contour integration in object recognition. It finds humans outperform models, especially with fragmented objects, and identifies an integration bias in humans that improves model performance when replicated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the failure points of deep learning models in generalizing to new input distributions, specifically in contour integration, a key aspect of human vision.

Method: The study designs an experiment testing object recognition under varying levels of object fragmentation, comparing human performance (n=50) with over 1,000 models.

Result: Humans perform well even with few contours, while models struggle unless trained on very large datasets (~5B). Models mimicking human integration bias perform better, and this bias increases with dataset size.

Conclusion: Contour integration is crucial for object recognition, likely learned from large-scale data, and replicating human biases can improve model performance.

Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of deep learning in computer vision, models
still fall behind humans in generalizing to new input distributions. Existing
benchmarks do not investigate the specific failure points of models by
analyzing performance under many controlled conditions. Our study
systematically dissects where and why models struggle with contour integration
-- a hallmark of human vision -- by designing an experiment that tests object
recognition under various levels of object fragmentation. Humans (n=50) perform
at high accuracy, even with few object contours present. This is in contrast to
models which exhibit substantially lower sensitivity to increasing object
contours, with most of the over 1,000 models we tested barely performing above
chance. Only at very large scales ($\sim5B$ training dataset size) do models
begin to approach human performance. Importantly, humans exhibit an integration
bias -- a preference towards recognizing objects made up of directional
fragments over directionless fragments. We find that not only do models that
share this property perform better at our task, but that this bias also
increases with model training dataset size, and training models to exhibit
contour integration leads to high shape bias. Taken together, our results
suggest that contour integration is a hallmark of object vision that underlies
object recognition performance, and may be a mechanism learned from data at
scale.

*Junli Liu, Qizhi Chen, Zhigang Wang, Yiwen Tang, Yiting Zhang, Chi Yan, Dong Wang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AerialVG, a new task for visual grounding in aerial views, addressing challenges like distinguishing visually similar objects and emphasizing positional relations. It presents a dataset of 5K aerial images with 50K descriptions and 103K objects, and proposes a model with Hierarchical Cross-Attention and Relation-Aware Grounding modules. Results show the method's effectiveness and the importance of spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual grounding (VG) struggles with aerial imagery due to high-resolution challenges and insufficient appearance-based grounding. AerialVG aims to address these gaps by focusing on spatial reasoning and positional relations.

Method: The paper introduces the AerialVG dataset (5K images, 50K descriptions, 103K objects) and proposes a model with Hierarchical Cross-Attention for target region focus and a Relation-Aware Grounding module for positional relation inference.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and method, emphasizing the role of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial VG, introduces a novel dataset, and presents a model that outperforms existing methods. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on
natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task
focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG,
AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is
insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and
positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle
when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant
difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG
dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated
descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG
dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial
relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning.
Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task,
where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and
a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations.
Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method,
highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding.
The code and dataset will be released.

*Mahshad Lotfinia, Arash Tayebiarasteh, Samaneh Samiei, Mehdi Joodaki, Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FL struggles with non-IID data, especially pediatric datasets. Self-supervised learning improves FL performance in pediatric and most adult cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation of FL in non-IID settings, particularly for pediatric data, using self-supervised learning.

Method: Analyzed adult and pediatric chest radiographs using FL and transfer learning with self-supervised image representations.

Result: FL improved smaller adult datasets but degraded larger ones and pediatric cases. Self-supervised weights enhanced pediatric and most adult datasets.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning can mitigate non-IID challenges in FL, benefiting pediatric healthcare despite data scarcity.

Abstract: Reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical image analysis often
depend on large and diverse labeled datasets. Federated learning (FL) offers a
decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to training but struggles in
highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where
institutions with more representative data may experience degraded performance.
Moreover, existing large-scale FL studies have been limited to adult datasets,
neglecting the unique challenges posed by pediatric data, which introduces
additional non-IID variability. To address these limitations, we analyzed
n=398,523 adult chest radiographs from diverse institutions across multiple
countries and n=9,125 pediatric images, leveraging transfer learning from
general-purpose self-supervised image representations to classify pneumonia and
cases with no abnormality. Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found
that FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but
degraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases
(P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly
enhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets
(P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the
potential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image
representations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and
highlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric
healthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the opacity of high-performing closed-source vision-language models, the paper aims to enable transparent research by building an open framework without proprietary model distillation.

Method: The study analyzes standard training pipelines without proprietary distillation, explores large-scale synthetic data, and releases human-labeled video QA pairs and captions.

Result: The work provides 2.8M labeled video instances and PLM-VideoBench for evaluation, ensuring reproducibility with open data, code, and models.

Conclusion: The paper advances transparent research in vision-language models by offering open tools and addressing critical data gaps in video understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many
high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and
training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation
from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark
results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without
knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific
progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a
Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for
transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard
training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore
large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in
detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M
human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and
spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce
PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks
focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a
video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes,

Method: The survey categorizes methods into feature-based pipelines, end-to-end architectures, and multimodal strategies, and reviews datasets and evaluation protocols.

Result: Identifies limitations like reliance on broadcast-quality footage and lenient multi-label metrics, which hinder real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Outlines open challenges and future directions for more precise, generalizable, and practical event spotting in sports video analysis.

Abstract: Video event detection is central to modern sports analytics, enabling
automated understanding of key moments for performance evaluation, content
creation, and tactical feedback. While deep learning has significantly advanced
tasks like Temporal Action Localization (TAL), Action Spotting (AS), and
Precise Event Spotting (PES), existing surveys often overlook the fine-grained

first provides a clear conceptual distinction between TAL, AS, and PES, then
introduces a methods-based taxonomy covering recent deep learning approaches
for AS and PES, including feature-based pipelines, end-to-end architectures,
and multimodal strategies. We further review benchmark datasets and evaluation
protocols, identifying critical limitations such as reliance on
broadcast-quality footage and lenient multi-label metrics that hinder
real-world deployment. Finally, we outline open challenges and future
directions toward more temporally precise, generalizable, and practical event
spotting in sports video analysis.

*Cainan Davidson, Deva Ramanan, Neehar Peri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefAV introduces a vision-language model approach for spatio-temporal scenario mining in AV driving logs, addressing challenges in identifying safety-critical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scenario mining methods are error-prone and time-consuming, necessitating a more efficient and accurate approach.

Method: RefAV uses vision-language models (VLMs) to detect and localize described scenarios in driving logs, supported by a dataset of 10,000 natural language queries.

Result: Off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly, highlighting unique challenges in scenario mining. The paper presents empirical analysis and a CVPR 2025 competition.

Conclusion: RefAV offers a novel dataset and method for scenario mining, with insights for future improvements.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal
data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying
interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a
significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone
and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured
queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the
lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described
scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time
and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset
of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent
interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the
Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object
trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find
that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting
that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Lastly, we discuss our recent
CVPR 2025 competition and share insights from the community. Our code and

*Gonglin Chen, Tianwen Fu, Haiwei Chen, Wenbin Teng, Hanyuan Xiao, Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel keypoint detector/descriptor using deformable transformers to improve feature detection under challenging conditions like viewpoint changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to capture long-range visual cues and geometric invariance, limiting robust feature detection in scenarios like structure-from-motion and SLAM.

Method: RDD leverages deformable self-attention mechanisms to focus on key locations, reducing search space complexity and modeling geometric invariance. Training includes a new Air-to-Ground dataset alongside MegaDepth.

Result: RDD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sparse matching and enables semi-dense matching. Two new benchmarks are introduced for evaluation.

Conclusion: RDD advances feature detection by addressing global context and geometric invariance, validated by superior performance and new benchmarks.

Abstract: As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection
and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint
changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have
identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric
transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in
long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel
and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer,
which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable
self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention
focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and
modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground
dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our
proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description
methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To
ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one
emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an
Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining
popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack capabilities in image perception and manipulation, while GPT-4o-Image's advanced features suggest semantic encoders outperform VAEs.

Method: Proposes UniWorld-V1, leveraging semantic features from multimodal LLMs and contrastive encoders, trained on 2.7M data.

Result: UniWorld-V1 excels in image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception tasks.

Conclusion: The framework is open-sourced to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Although existing unified models achieve strong performance in
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, they remain limited
in addressing image perception and manipulation -- capabilities increasingly
demanded in practical applications. Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful
GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive
image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through
carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on
semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being
commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this
insight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon
semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and
contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1
achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image
understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source
the UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation
scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.

Motivation: To trace the evolution of visual image reconstruction, emphasizing the need for better generalization, ethical practices, and improved evaluation metrics.

Method: Integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative models, focusing on hierarchical latent representations and compositional strategies.

Result: Significant progress in decoding detailed visual experiences, but challenges like zero-shot generalization and subjective perception modeling remain.

Conclusion: Visual image reconstruction holds promise for neural coding insights and applications, but requires ethical considerations and further methodological refinements.

Abstract: Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain
activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep
neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's
evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions
that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of
hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular
architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving
true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the
complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse
datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments,
and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and
generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential
misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development.
Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and
enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications
spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess VLMs' scene comprehension, addressing gaps in standardized evaluation methods.

Method: Introduces CIVET, a controlled framework for evaluating VLMs using noise-free stimuli, testing five state-of-the-art models.

Result: VLMs recognize limited basic properties, depend on object position, and struggle with relations, lagging behind human performance.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack robust scene understanding, highlighting the need for improved models and evaluation standards.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient, accessible solution for identifying plant leaf diseases in Bangladesh, where agriculture is vital for food security, reducing reliance on expert knowledge.

Method: Uses CNN and Transfer Learning models (VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50V2, Xception) and Explainable AI techniques (GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM, FasterScoreCAM) for disease classification and transparency.

Result: VGG19 and Xception achieve the highest accuracies (98.90% and 98.66% respectively).

Conclusion: The approach improves disease management, supports informed farmer decisions, and enhances agricultural productivity.

Abstract: Leaf diseases are harmful conditions that affect the health, appearance and
productivity of plants, leading to significant plant loss and negatively
impacting farmers' livelihoods. These diseases cause visible symptoms such as
lesions, color changes, and texture variations, making it difficult for farmers
to manage plant health, especially in large or remote farms where expert
knowledge is limited. The main motivation of this study is to provide an
efficient and accessible solution for identifying plant leaf diseases in
Bangladesh, where agriculture plays a critical role in food security. The
objective of our research is to classify 21 distinct leaf diseases across six
plants using deep learning models, improving disease detection accuracy while
reducing the need for expert involvement. Deep Learning (DL) techniques,
including CNN and Transfer Learning (TL) models like VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2,
InceptionV3, ResNet50V2 and Xception are used. VGG19 and Xception achieve the
highest accuracies, with 98.90% and 98.66% respectively. Additionally,
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM
and FasterScoreCAM are used to enhance transparency by highlighting the regions
of the models focused on during disease classification. This transparency
ensures that farmers can understand the model's predictions and take necessary
action. This approach not only improves disease management but also supports
farmers in making informed decisions, leading to better plant protection and
increased agricultural productivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain-related conditions are hard to diagnose; MRI interpretation is complex. The study aims to improve classification and transparency in diagnosing brain diseases.

Method: Comparative analysis of ViT and TL models (VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50V2, MobilenetV2) on MRI data, enhanced with XAI methods (GradCAM, GradCAM++, etc.).

Result: ViT outperforms TL models with 94.39% accuracy. XAI methods provide interpretable insights for medical professionals.

Conclusion: ViT is effective for brain disease classification, and XAI enhances diagnostic precision, aiding medical decision-making.

Abstract: The brain is a highly complex organ that manages many important tasks,
including movement, memory and thinking. Brain-related conditions, like tumors
and degenerative disorders, can be hard to diagnose and treat. Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as a key tool for identifying these conditions,
offering high-resolution images of brain structures. Despite this, interpreting
MRI scans can be complicated. This study tackles this challenge by conducting a
comparative analysis of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transfer Learning (TL)
models such as VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50V2, MobilenetV2 for classifying brain
diseases using MRI data from Bangladesh based dataset. ViT, known for their
ability to capture global relationships in images, are particularly effective
for medical imaging tasks. Transfer learning helps to mitigate data constraints
by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) methods
such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM, and Faster-ScoreCAM are
employed to interpret model predictions. The results demonstrate that ViT
surpasses transfer learning models, achieving a classification accuracy of
94.39%. The integration of XAI methods enhances model transparency, offering
crucial insights to aid medical professionals in diagnosing brain diseases with
greater precision.

TL;DR: AnchorFormer reduces ViT complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(mn) using anchor tokens, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs suffer from high computational cost (O(n¬≤)) and redundant tokens. AnchorFormer addresses this by focusing on pivotal regions.

Method: Uses anchor tokens for bipartite attention, reducing complexity. Anchors are learned via differentiable neurons, approximating global self-attention.

Result: Achieves 9.0% higher accuracy, 46.7% FLOPs reduction on ImageNet, and 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection.

Conclusion: AnchorFormer efficiently approximates global attention, enhancing performance and reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on
vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches.
Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image
with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly
gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for
the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based
efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to
learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by
estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the
complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where
$m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with
the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiably learn these anchors and
approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. It avoids the
burden caused by non-differentiable operations and further speeds up the
approximate attention. Moreover, we extend the proposed model to three
downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our AnchorFormer, e.g.,
achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs reduction on ImageNet
classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as
compared to the current baselines.

TL;DR: CryoCCD is a framework combining biophysical modeling and generative techniques to create realistic cryo-EM micrographs, improving downstream analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality annotated cryo-EM data and limitations of existing synthetic data methods hinder robust model development.

Method: CryoCCD integrates biophysical modeling with generative techniques, using a conditional diffusion model for realistic noise and structural fidelity.

Result: CryoCCD generates accurate micrographs and outperforms baselines in particle picking and reconstruction.

Conclusion: CryoCCD addresses key challenges in cryo-EM data synthesis, enhancing downstream analysis performance.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

Motivation: The growing use of computer vision in agriculture faces issues like environmental variations and data diversity, hindering model generalization. DA is proposed as a solution.

Method: The review categorizes DA into shallow and deep learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised strategies, with a focus on adversarial learning.

Result: DA methods enhance performance in tasks like crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, with adversarial techniques showing strong potential.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework and insights to guide future DA research in agricultural vision tasks, highlighting the importance of addressing domain shifts.

Abstract: With the growing application of computer vision in agriculture, image
analysis has become essential for tasks such as crop health monitoring and pest
detection. However, significant domain shifts caused by environmental
variations, different crop types, and diverse data acquisition methods hinder
model generalization across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural

address these challenges by improving cross-domain transferability in
agricultural image analysis. Given the limited availability of labeled data,
weak model adaptability, and dynamic field conditions, DA has emerged as a
promising solution. The review systematically summarizes recent advances in DA
for agricultural imagery, focusing on applications such as crop health
monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, where DA methods have
enhanced performance across diverse domains. DA approaches are categorized into
shallow and deep learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised, and
unsupervised strategies, with particular attention to adversarial
learning-based techniques that have demonstrated strong potential in complex
scenarios. In addition, the paper reviews key public agricultural image
datasets, evaluating their strengths and limitations in DA research. Overall,
this work offers a comprehensive framework and critical insights to guide
future research and development of domain adaptation in agricultural vision
tasks.

Motivation: To create a unified framework for generating consistent multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences, addressing the need for coherent multi-modal data in autonomous driving applications.

Method: Two-stage architecture: DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering. Shared latent space ensures cross-modal consistency. DataCrafter provides semantic supervision.

Conclusion: Genesis effectively generates high-quality, semantically consistent multi-modal data, proving useful for practical applications in autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view

consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a
DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR

directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution
across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured
semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on
vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level
supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that
Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics

*Kaiyu Guo, Zijian Wang, Tan Pan, Brian C. Lovell, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic method to correct geometry distortion in OOD detection by adjusting the prior covariance matrix in real-time, improving performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subspace-based OOD detection methods fail to handle geometry distortion caused by ill-distributed samples due to static prior extraction.

Method: Dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features, reducing covariance along input directions and preserving residual space.

Result: Significantly enhances OOD detection performance on CIFAR and ImageNet-1k datasets, including the DINO model.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment of prior geometry effectively addresses distortion, improving OOD detection reliability.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'drawing to reason in space,' a novel paradigm for LVLMs to enhance spatial reasoning by using visual drawing operations, outperforming existing methods by 18.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning methods are text-centric and struggle with spatial tasks requiring geometric understanding. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by enabling LVLMs to reason visually.

Method: The proposed method involves equipping LVLMs with drawing operations (e.g., bounding boxes, auxiliary lines) and a three-stage training framework: cold-start training, reflective rejection sampling, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The model, VILASR, shows significant improvements (18.4% on average) across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual reasoning through drawing operations effectively addresses the limitations of text-centric approaches, enhancing LVLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mask-based LoRA tuning method is proposed for flexible video editing using pretrained I2V models, preserving backgrounds while enabling controllable edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on large-scale pretraining and lack flexibility for specific edits, especially beyond the first frame.

Method: The approach uses mask-driven LoRA tuning to adapt pretrained I2V models, incorporating reference images and spatial masks for region-specific learning.

Result: The method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed solution offers efficient, adaptable video editing without altering model architecture, addressing flexibility and control challenges.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQE-CLIP is a new framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection in the medical domain, improving CLIP's adaptability and sensitivity to anomalies through class-based and learnable prompting tokens, and an instance-aware query module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for anomaly detection rely on prior knowledge and tailored prompts, lacking effectiveness in distinguishing anomalies in joint embedding space and are rarely applied to medical tasks.

Method: IQE-CLIP introduces class-based and learnable prompting tokens for domain adaptation and an instance-aware query module (IQM) to generate anomaly-sensitive query embeddings from text and visual features.

Result: IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on six medical datasets for zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed IQE-CLIP framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in medical anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancements of vision-language models, such as CLIP,
leads to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD)
tasks. However, most existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods commonly assume prior
knowledge of categories and rely on carefully crafted prompts tailored to
specific scenarios. While such meticulously designed text prompts effectively
capture semantic information in the textual space, they fall short of
distinguishing normal and anomalous instances within the joint embedding space.
Moreover, these ZFSAD methods are predominantly explored in industrial
scenarios, with few efforts conducted to medical tasks. To this end, we propose
an innovative framework for ZFSAD tasks in medical domain, denoted as IQE-CLIP.
We reveal that query embeddings, which incorporate both textual and
instance-aware visual information, are better indicators for abnormalities.
Specifically, we first introduce class-based prompting tokens and learnable
prompting tokens for better adaptation of CLIP to the medical domain. Then, we
design an instance-aware query module (IQM) to extract region-level contextual
information from both text prompts and visual features, enabling the generation
of query embeddings that are more sensitive to anomalies. Extensive experiments
conducted on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We release
our code and data at https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments change dynamically in space and time, posing challenges for world modeling. The goal is to capture these dynamics for better agent behavior.

Method: The authors create STRIDE, a dataset of interconnected observation, state, and action nodes from 360-degree imagery. They use TARDIS, a transformer-based model, to integrate spatial and temporal dynamics.

Result: The model achieves robust performance in tasks like photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous control, and georeferencing.

Conclusion: The approach advances generalist agents by enhancing their ability to understand and manipulate spatio-temporal dynamics. Resources are publicly available.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

Conclusion: BreastDCEDL addresses the data gap, supports reproducible research, and enables clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical
priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset
comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from
2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts,
all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were
rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal
integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical
metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR),
and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and
deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data,
progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets.
BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models,

TL;DR: Perceptual-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by adaptively optimizing Gaussian primitives based on human perception, enhancing quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods lack adaptive optimization for Gaussian distribution, hindering balance between quality and efficiency.

Method: Introduces perception-aware representation and perceptual sensitivity-adaptive distribution to allocate finer granularity to critical regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality, efficiency, and robustness on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Perceptual-GS effectively integrates perceptual sensitivity into 3DGS, improving adaptive optimization and performance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel
view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the
distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it
challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human
perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian
Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual
sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first
introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual
sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on
this foundation, we develop a perceptual sensitivity-adaptive distribution to
allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical regions, enhancing
reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate that
Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality,
efficiency, and robustness. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: The framework enhances urban forecasting accuracy and realism, contributing a multimodal dataset for urban and transportation planning.

Abstract: This study presents a novel demographics informed deep learning framework
designed to forecast urban spatial transformations by jointly modeling
geographic satellite imagery, socio-demographics, and travel behavior dynamics.
The proposed model employs an encoder-decoder architecture with temporal gated
residual connections, integrating satellite imagery and demographic data to
accurately forecast future spatial transformations. The study also introduces a
demographics prediction component which ensures that predicted satellite

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often follows a long-tailed distribution, but existing GCD works assume uniform distributions, leaving a gap in research.

Method: The proposed framework uses confident sample selection and density-based clustering to address challenges like classifier learning and category number estimation.

Result: Experiments show the method's effectiveness on both long-tailed and conventional GCD datasets.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses GCD under long-tailed distributions, offering a practical solution for real-world data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
under a long-tailed distribution, which involves discovering novel categories
in an unlabelled dataset using knowledge from a set of labelled categories.
Existing works assume a uniform distribution for both datasets, but real-world
data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where a few categories contain
most examples, while others have only a few. While the long-tailed distribution
is well-studied in supervised and semi-supervised settings, it remains
unexplored in the GCD context. We identify two challenges in this setting -
balancing classifier learning and estimating category numbers - and propose a
framework based on confident sample selection and density-based clustering to
tackle them. Our experiments on both long-tailed and conventional GCD datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: SP-VLA accelerates Vision-Language-Action models by reducing temporal and spatial redundancies through model scheduling and token pruning, achieving 1.5x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models suffer from high computational costs and low execution frequency, making them unsuitable for real-time tasks like robotic manipulation. Current acceleration methods focus on structural optimization but ignore temporal and spatial redundancies.

Method: SP-VLA introduces action-aware model scheduling (switching between VLA and lightweight generator) and spatio-semantic token pruning to reduce redundancies. Actions are categorized as deliberative (VLA) or intuitive (lightweight generator).

Result: The method achieves up to 1.5x acceleration with less than 3% accuracy drop, outperforming existing approaches in multiple tasks.

Conclusion: SP-VLA effectively balances speed and accuracy by addressing temporal and spatial redundancies, making VLA models more suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for
their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and
low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as
robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration
methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that
these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,
temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in
visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified
framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning
tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that
reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a
lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key
decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA
actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model
and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive
execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial
redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning
method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based
on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two
mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and
salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining
high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to
1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming
existing approaches in multiple tasks.

### [321] [Hierarchical Multi-Positive Contrastive Learning for Patent Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13496)
*Kshitij Kavimandan, Angelos Nalmpantis, Emma Beauxis-Aussalet, Robert-Jan Sips*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss method improves patent image retrieval by leveraging the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system's taxonomy, enhancing results even with low-parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent images are complex and current retrieval methods ignore hierarchical relationships like those in the LIC system, limiting accuracy.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that uses LIC taxonomy to assign multiple positive pairs with varying similarity scores.

Result: Experimental analysis on DeepPatent2 shows improved retrieval, especially with low-parameter models.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages hierarchical relationships for better patent image retrieval while being resource-efficient.

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections
and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information
retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their
technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient
fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents'
hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International
Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing")
into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent
designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive
loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the
retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the
retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,
which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments
with limited hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeSPITE introduces a multi-modal contrastive pre-training model for human activity understanding, combining LiDAR, skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LiDAR's potential in multi-modal contrastive pre-training for human activity understanding, which is underexplored.

Method: DeSPITE learns a joint embedding space across LiDAR point clouds, skeleton poses, IMU data, and text, using synchronized data from LIPD and Babel datasets.

Result: Enables novel tasks like Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching and retrieval, and improves point cloud HAR in MSR-Action3D and HMPEAR.

Conclusion: DeSPITE effectively bridges the gap in multi-modal human activity understanding and serves as a strong pre-training strategy.

Abstract: Despite LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) being an effective
privacy-preserving alternative to RGB cameras to perceive human activities, it
remains largely underexplored in the context of multi-modal contrastive
pre-training for human activity understanding (e.g., human activity recognition
(HAR), retrieval, or person re-identification (RE-ID)). To close this gap, our
work explores learning the correspondence between LiDAR point clouds, human
skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space. More
specifically, we present DeSPITE, a Deep Skeleton-Pointcloud-IMU-Text Embedding
model, which effectively learns a joint embedding space across these four
modalities. At the heart of our empirical exploration, we have combined the
existing LIPD and Babel datasets, which enabled us to synchronize data of all
four modalities, allowing us to explore the learning of a new joint embedding
space. Our experiments demonstrate novel human activity understanding tasks for
point cloud sequences enabled through DeSPITE, including
Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching, retrieval, and temporal moment retrieval.
Furthermore, we show that DeSPITE is an effective pre-training strategy for
point cloud HAR through experiments in MSR-Action3D and HMPEAR.

*Xiaohui Jiang, Haijiang Zhu, Chade Li, Fulin Tang, Ning An*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LiDAR-based place recognition framework using density-agnostic geometric reasoning achieves state-of-the-art performance by fusing macro and micro geometric information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of inconsistent point cloud density and representation fragility in current LiDAR-based place recognition methods.

Method: Introduces an implicit 3D representation with elastic points, derives occupancy grid and normal vectors, and fuses geometric information from bird's-eye view and 3D segments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) with balanced accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is resilient, scalable, and outperforms existing methods, with plans to open-source the code.

Abstract: LiDAR-based place recognition serves as a crucial enabler for long-term
autonomy in robotics and autonomous driving systems. Yet, prevailing
methodologies relying on handcrafted feature extraction face dual challenges:
(1) Inconsistent point cloud density, induced by ego-motion dynamics and
environmental disturbances during repeated traversals, leads to descriptor
instability, and (2) Representation fragility stems from reliance on
single-level geometric abstractions that lack discriminative power in
structurally complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework that redefines 3D place recognition through density-agnostic
geometric reasoning. Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation
based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene
point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution.
Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the
scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two
types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information
from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D
segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted
extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT)
across diverse environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our approach strikes an
optimal balance between accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization for
historical maps, showcasing excellent Resilient and scalability. Our code will
be open-sourced in the future.

### [324] [Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance for Counterfactual Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14399)
*Tian Xia, Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro, Rajat R Rasal, Avinash Kori, Raghav Mehta, Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG) to improve counterfactual image generation by disentangling attribute control, enhancing fidelity and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CFG leads to poor identity preservation and spurious attribute changes (attribute amplification) in counterfactual image generation.

Method: Introduces DCFG, a model-agnostic framework with group-wise conditioning control and attribute-split embedding to disentangle semantic inputs.

Result: DCFG improves intervention fidelity, mitigates unintended changes, and enhances reversibility on datasets like CelebA-HQ, MIMIC-CXR, and EMBED.

Conclusion: DCFG enables more faithful and interpretable counterfactual image generation by addressing limitations of standard CFG.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation aims to simulate realistic visual outcomes
under specific causal interventions. Diffusion models have recently emerged as
a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional
generation via classifier-free guidance (CFG). However, standard CFG applies a
single global weight across all conditioning variables, which can lead to poor
identity preservation and spurious attribute changes - a phenomenon known as
attribute amplification. To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free
Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces
group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding
strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on
user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition
attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply
distinct guidance to each. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, MIMIC-CXR, and EMBED show
that DCFG improves intervention fidelity, mitigates unintended changes, and
enhances reversibility, enabling more faithful and interpretable counterfactual
image generation.

*Varun Mannam, Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based approach automates key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos, reducing manual effort and costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual video annotation in retail is time-consuming and costly, requiring a more efficient and automated solution.

Method: Uses deep neural networks for key-frame identification and object detection tailored for retail environments.

Result: Achieves human-level accuracy with 2x cost savings and requires human verification for less than 5% of frames.

Conclusion: The method significantly reduces operational costs and saves time, proving valuable for retail applications like shopper analysis and security monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

### [326] [SynPo: Boosting Training-Free Few-Shot Medical Segmentation via High-Quality Negative Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15153)
*Yufei Liu, Haoke Xiao, Jiaxing Chai, Yongcun Zhang, Rong Wang, Zijie Meng, Zhiming Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPo improves few-shot medical image segmentation by enhancing negative prompts in LVMs like SAM, using a Confidence Map Synergy Module and K-means clustering for point selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods using LVMs perform poorly on low-contrast medical images due to ineffective negative prompts.

Method: SynPo combines DINOv2 and SAM for reliable confidence maps, selects top-k positive and Gaussian-distributed negative points, and applies K-means clustering for high-quality prompts.

Result: SynPo matches state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods in performance.

Conclusion: SynPo effectively addresses the limitations of LVMs in medical image segmentation by improving prompt quality.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

### [327] [OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15318)
*Lanfeng Zhong, Xin Liao, Shichuan Zhang, Shaoting Zhang, Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenPath is a novel open-set active learning method for pathology image classification, leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model to efficiently select informative in-distribution samples while avoiding out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning methods assume closed-set scenarios, but real-world clinical data often includes out-of-distribution samples, reducing annotation efficiency. OpenPath addresses this by improving sample selection purity and informativeness.

Method: OpenPath uses task-specific prompts in the first query to select in-distribution samples. Subsequent queries employ Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS), combining Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS).

Result: Experiments on two public pathology datasets show OpenPath outperforms state-of-the-art open-set active learning methods, enhancing model performance due to high sample purity.

Conclusion: OpenPath effectively reduces labeling costs in open-set scenarios by improving sample selection, making it a valuable tool for pathology image classification.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: Show-o2 introduces unified multimodal models using autoregressive modeling and flow matching, enabling scalable understanding and generation across text, images, and videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile model for multimodal tasks by unifying visual representations and leveraging autoregressive and flow-based methods.

Method: Uses a 3D causal variational autoencoder with dual-path spatial-temporal fusion, autoregressive modeling for text, and flow matching for image/video generation.

Result: Show-o2 effectively handles diverse multimodal tasks, demonstrating scalability and versatility.

Conclusion: The model successfully integrates multimodal understanding and generation, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents improved native unified multimodal models, \emph{i.e.,}
Show-o2, that leverage autoregressive modeling and flow matching. Built upon a
3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are
constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling
scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective
multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model,
autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language
head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and
image/video generation. A two-stage training recipe is designed to effectively
learn and scale to larger models. The resulting Show-o2 models demonstrate
versatility in handling a wide range of multimodal understanding and generation
tasks across diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos. Code and
models are released at https://github.com/showlab/Show-o.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DLoRAL introduces a Dual LoRA Learning paradigm for Real-VSR, combining Cross-Frame Retrieval and Consistency-LoRA to maintain temporal coherence while enhancing spatial details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods sacrifice spatial details for temporal consistency, leading to suboptimal visual quality.

Method: Proposes a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm with Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) and Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) for temporal coherence, followed by Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) for spatial enhancement.

Result: DLoRAL achieves strong performance in accuracy and speed, delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances temporal consistency and spatial detail enhancement, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

The dataset is used to train an interactive model, YUME, demonstrating its potential for video generation and exploration applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation datasets are limited in scope (locations, duration, annotations), making them unsuitable for world exploration training.

Method: The authors create Sekai, a dataset with 5,000+ hours of first-person videos from 100+ countries, annotated with location, scene, weather, and more. They also develop a toolbox for efficient collection and annotation.

Result: Experiments confirm the dataset's quality, and a subset is used to train YUME, an interactive video world exploration model.

Conclusion: Sekai is a valuable resource for video generation and world exploration, with potential for impactful applications.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications. The project page is

*Khurram Yamin, Gaurav Ghosal, Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often relying on parametric knowledge, and finetuning may degrade their stored knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can integrate in-context knowledge with parametric knowledge, focusing on counterfactual reasoning.

Method: Synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, with post-hoc finetuning attempts.

Result: LLMs generally fail at counterfactual reasoning, defaulting to parametric knowledge, and finetuning can harm their existing knowledge.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in adapting parametric knowledge to novel settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in
their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive
tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter
situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or
unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine
knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of
counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop
reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual
reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.
Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill
counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored
parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of
current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes $	exttt{SPECS}$, a latency-aware test-time scaling method for LLMs, balancing accuracy and latency by using a smaller model for candidate generation and integrating reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods focus on accuracy via compute (FLOPS) but neglect latency, impacting user experience. $	exttt{SPECS}$ addresses this gap.

Method: $	exttt{SPECS}$ uses a smaller model for efficient candidate generation, evaluates candidates with a larger model and reward model, and introduces reward-guided soft verification and deferral.

Result: Empirical results show $	exttt{SPECS}$ matches or exceeds beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to 19.1%.

Conclusion: $	exttt{SPECS}$ effectively balances accuracy and latency, with theoretical convergence to a KL-regularized RL objective.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating
additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased
compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly
impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize
for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking
latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a
latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding.
$\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences
efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger
target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration
strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based
deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench
datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy
while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows
that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement
learning objective with increasing beam width.

*Peiyuan Tang, Haojie Xin, Xiaodong Zhang, Jun Sun, Qin Xia, Zijiang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "The Safety Reminder," a prompt-tuning method to enhance safety awareness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by proactively reactivating their delayed safety mechanisms, reducing harmful content generation without affecting normal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature, allowing adversaries to bypass safety measures and generate harmful content. The paper aims to address this by leveraging the observed "delayed safety awareness" phenomenon.

Method: The authors propose "The Safety Reminder," a soft prompt-tuning approach that injects learnable prompt tokens during text generation to reactivate safety awareness when harmful content is detected.

Result: The method significantly reduces attack success rates in VLMs across three safety benchmarks and one adversarial attack, while preserving model utility for benign tasks.

Conclusion: The Safety Reminder offers a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world applications by enhancing safety awareness without compromising performance.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across
real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance,
ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language
Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,
allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety
guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic
analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed
``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs
may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually
recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern
suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a
temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize
that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully
designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft
prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are
periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety
awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our
safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal
conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign
tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety
benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,
offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextBench, a benchmark for evaluating methods that generate linguistically fluent inputs to trigger specific behaviors or latent features in language models, focusing on safety applications. Enhanced Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: To identify inputs that activate specific behaviors or latent features in language models for safety applications.

Method: Formalizes context modification, introduces ContextBench, and enhances Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting.

Result: Enhanced EPO variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation effectiveness and fluency.

Conclusion: The approach advances the capability to generate targeted, fluent inputs for safety-critical applications in language models.

Abstract: Identifying inputs that trigger specific behaviours or latent features in
language models could have a wide range of safety use cases. We investigate a
class of methods capable of generating targeted, linguistically fluent inputs
that activate specific latent features or elicit model behaviours. We formalise
this approach as context modification and present ContextBench -- a benchmark
with tasks assessing core method capabilities and potential safety
applications. Our evaluation framework measures both elicitation strength
(activation of latent features or behaviours) and linguistic fluency,
highlighting how current state-of-the-art methods struggle to balance these
objectives. We enhance Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with
LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, and demonstrate that these
variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation
effectiveness and fluency.

*Jonathan Kutasov, Yuqi Sun, Paul Colognese, Teun van der Weij, Linda Petrini, Chen Bo Calvin Zhang, John Hughes, Xiang Deng, Henry Sleight, Tyler Tracy, Buck Shlegeris, Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to pursue hidden harmful objectives while completing tasks, using SHADE-Arena for testing. Top models show limited sabotage success, with monitoring proving challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the risks of LLMs acting as autonomous agents with hidden harmful goals, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Uses SHADE-Arena, a diverse dataset with benign main tasks and harmful side objectives, to test LLMs' sabotage and monitoring capabilities.

Result: Best models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieved 27% and 15% sabotage success, respectively. Monitoring was difficult, with top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving AUC 0.87.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with sabotage due to execution flaws, but monitoring subtle sabotage is already challenging and will worsen with more complex tasks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their
ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability
of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while
completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of
frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena,
the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring
capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign
main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are
evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing
suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the
main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that
the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15%
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For
current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having
access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use
SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign
transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to
failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already
demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we
expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of standardization in Agentic AI research, introduces a robust evaluation protocol, and presents OAgents, a modular framework achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent research lacks standardization and scientific rigor, hindering fair comparisons and progress measurement.

Method: A systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to evaluate design choices in agent components.

Result: Reveals key components for effective agents, introduces a stable evaluation protocol, and develops OAgents, a top-performing modular framework.

Conclusion: OAgents provides a standardized, modular foundation for future Agentic AI research, addressing reproducibility and performance issues.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field.
However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization
and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods.
As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent
frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains
challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA
benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key
agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a
standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,
non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we
introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study
reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while
others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build
and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a
modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in
Agentic AI.

### [337] [Sysformer: Safeguarding Frozen Large Language Models with Adaptive System Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15751)
*Kartik Sharma, Yiqiao Jin, Vineeth Rakesh, Yingtong Dou, Menghai Pan, Mahashweta Das, Srijan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sysformer, a transformer-based model that adapts system prompts in LLMs to enhance safety, achieving significant improvements in refusal rates for harmful prompts and compliance with safe ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing defenses for LLM safety, which often involve costly fine-tuning or suboptimal heuristics, by dynamically adapting system prompts.

Method: Proposes Sysformer, a transformer model that updates initial system prompts in the LLM input embedding space, trained to refuse harmful prompts and respond ideally to safe ones while keeping LLM parameters frozen.

Result: Sysformer improves refusal rates on harmful prompts by up to 80%, enhances compliance with safe prompts by up to 90%, and boosts robustness against jailbreaking attacks by up to 100%.

Conclusion: Sysformer offers a cost-effective solution for safeguarding LLMs and encourages future research into variable system prompt design.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it
is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior
research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe
behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the
generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to
improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of
model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we
take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts
in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a
fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt
to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we
propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an
initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM
input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM
parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of
harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through
extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent
benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the
robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful
prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$.
Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs
upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our
findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future
investigations into designing variable system prompts.

*Yining Hong, Rui Sun, Bingxuan Li, Xingcheng Yao, Maxine Wu, Alexander Chien, Da Yin, Ying Nian Wu, Zhecan James Wang, Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Embodied Web Agents, a paradigm integrating physical and digital intelligence for AI, and benchmarks tasks requiring such integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are siloed, limiting their ability to solve tasks requiring both physical and digital intelligence.

Method: Developed a unified simulation platform (Embodied Web Agents task environments) and benchmark for tasks like cooking and navigation.

Result: Revealed performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI and humans in cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights challenges and opportunities in merging embodied cognition with web-scale knowledge.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly
available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIfly is a framework for efficient causal inference by reducing tasks to reachability in state-space graphs, offering linear-time performance and outperforming traditional methods like moralization and latent projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more efficient and scalable alternative to existing causal inference primitives, which are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses reachability in state-space graphs constructed on-the-fly, formalized via rule tables, and implemented in Rust for high performance.

Result: CIfly achieves linear-time performance, outperforms traditional methods, and supports Python/R integration.

Conclusion: CIfly is a flexible, scalable backbone for causal inference, enabling efficient algorithm development and deployment.

Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in
graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core
operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be
reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be
constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for
specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish
CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and
latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean
matrix multiplication. Our open-source Rust implementation parses rule table
text files and runs the specified CIfly algorithms providing high-performance
execution accessible from Python and R. We demonstrate CIfly's utility by
re-implementing a range of established causal inference tasks within the
framework and by developing new algorithms for instrumental variables. These
contributions position CIfly as a flexible and scalable backbone for graphical
causal inference, guiding algorithm development and enabling easy and efficient
deployment.

*J. Schwardt, J. C. Budich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOCSAT, a new stochastic local search heuristic for 3-SAT, outperforms existing solvers like WalkSAT and Kissat by addressing oversatisfied constraints, especially in hard instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers like WalkSAT get stuck in local minima due to oversatisfied constraints, limiting performance on hard 3-SAT instances.

Method: DOCSAT dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC) to reduce their abundance and escape local minima.

Result: DOCSAT outperforms WalkSAT and Kissat on hard 3-SAT instances up to N=15000, even in the hardest quintile.

Conclusion: DOCSAT's approach of leveraging statistical structure beyond the primary cost function can generalize to other optimization problems.

Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the
NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing
solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our
construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous
approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are
distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied
combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm,
coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their
unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark
our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT
instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find
that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including
the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the
hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.
The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure
beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape
local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for
generalization to other optimization problems.

*Lukas Helff, Ahmad Omar, Felix Friedrich, Wolfgang Stammer, Antonia W√ºst, Tim Woydt, Rupert Mitchell, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SLR is a framework for scalable, automated evaluation and training of LLMs via logical reasoning, creating tasks with controlled difficulty and no human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate and improve LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities without relying on human annotation or existing datasets.

Method: SLR synthesizes tasks with ground-truth rules, validation programs, and prompts, creating the SLR-Bench benchmark with 19k prompts across 20 difficulty levels.

Result: LLMs often fail at correct logical inference despite producing valid rules. Logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy, matching Gemini-Flash-Thinking at lower cost.

Conclusion: SLR provides a scalable, automated way to probe and enhance LLMs' reasoning, ensuring novelty and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and
training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given
a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of
inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,
SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation
program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and
(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create
SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum
levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive
complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily
produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.
Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in
test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,
logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity
with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully
automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a
scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: Addresses the need for adaptable AI agents in high-stakes negotiations, ensuring reliability in diverse human-AI team dynamics.

Method: Uses Sotopia for simulations; Experiment 1 analyzes personality traits' impact on bargaining, while Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by manipulating traits and AI characteristics.

Result: Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly influence negotiation outcomes. AI transparency, competence, and adaptability affect trust and mission effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides actionable insights for designing reliable AI agents in complex, high-stakes scenarios, advancing beyond standard performance metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex

TL;DR: BEWA is a Bayesian-based architecture for structured scientific belief updates, integrating replication scores, citation weighting, and temporal decay to enhance machine reasoning and truth utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of processing vast scientific literature by formalizing belief updates and epistemic integrity.

Method: Uses Bayesian inference, replication scores, citation weighting, temporal decay, and graph-based claim propagation.

Result: Enables probabilistically coherent belief updates, author credibility modeling, and audit-resilient integrity.

Conclusion: BEWA provides a foundation for machine reasoning systems that ensure rational belief convergence and truth utility in science.

Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the
epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial
intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted
Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises
belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured
scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and
evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and
temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian
inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The
architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility
modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By
formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic
network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that
promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient
integrity across dynamic scientific domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel value functions for dual-objective RL problems, leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi equations to address Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems, and proposes DO-HJ-PPO, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard constraints in RL degrade performance; Lagrangian methods require complex tuning. The work aims to simplify dual-objective satisfaction without intricate engineering.

Method: Extends Hamilton-Jacobi RL advances to derive tractable Bellman forms for Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems, proposing DO-HJ-PPO for implementation.

Result: DO-HJ-PPO produces distinct behaviors and outperforms baselines in safe-arrival and multi-target tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a new perspective on constrained decision-making, solving dual-objective problems effectively with explicit, tractable forms.

Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the
reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance.
Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often
require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we
extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to
propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we
address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and
penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds
of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which
typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable
Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and
reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From
a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are
complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems
and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained
decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal
Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of
tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that
DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches
and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI for desktop tasks has high latency due to excessive model calls for planning and reflection, making it impractical. A study on OSWorld reveals inefficiencies, with agents taking 1.4-2.7x more steps than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI systems for desktop tasks are impractical due to high latency, despite high benchmark accuracy. Understanding the causes can guide future improvements.

Method: Conducted a study on OSWorld to analyze temporal performance, identifying model calls as the main latency source. Created OSWorld-Human, a human-annotated dataset, to evaluate agent efficiency.

Result: Large model calls dominate latency, and agents take significantly more steps (1.4-2.7x) than humans to complete tasks.

Conclusion: Future AI agents must optimize planning and reflection to reduce latency and improve efficiency for practical desktop task automation.

Abstract: Generative AI is being leveraged to solve a variety of computer-use tasks
involving desktop applications. State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on
improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are
practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of
minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.
To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of
computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of
computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We
find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the
majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a
task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a
task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the
original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each
task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found
that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than
necessary.

TL;DR: The paper presents verification mechanisms for an ontology-based process model to ensure correct data retrieval and interpretation in manufacturing, demonstrated with a Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) use case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like context-relevant data selection, unit compatibility, and input data completeness in modeling manufacturing process interdependencies.

Method: Uses SPARQL-based filtering, unit consistency checks, and data completeness checks within an ontology-based process model.

Result: Demonstrates applicability in RTM, supporting machine-interpretable and verifiable engineering models.

Conclusion: The approach enhances consistency and correctness in modeling process interdependencies, facilitating knowledge reuse and cross-context application.

Abstract: The formalization of process knowledge using ontologies enables consistent
modeling of parameter interdependencies in manufacturing. These
interdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that
define relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as
calculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application
and knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and
applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a
consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data
retrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required
to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring
unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the
completeness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions.
This paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed
ontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics,
data element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs. The approach
includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a
unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic
classification, and (iii) a data completeness check to validate the
evaluability of interdependencies. The applicability of the approach is
demonstrated with a use case from Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), supporting the
development of machine-interpretable and verifiable engineering models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical meta-representation called the Structural Temporal Graph (STG) for analyzing music at multiple levels. It introduces a method to derive structural summaries of music corpora using combinatorial optimization and simulated annealing, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Western music's hierarchical structure requires a unified representation for holistic analysis. The STG aims to capture multi-granularity features and temporal relationships in music.

Method: The method involves creating STGs for individual pieces, measuring structural distance via simulated annealing, and using SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing to derive centroid STGs for corpora.

Result: Experiments confirm that structural distance differentiates music pieces and that centroid STGs accurately represent their corpora.

Conclusion: The STG and proposed method effectively analyze and summarize music structure, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of
structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze
music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a
unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the
structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data
structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical
features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable
a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music
corpus, which we formalize as a nested NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first
applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between
two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the
formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over
structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid
STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our
approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately
differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately
structurally characterize their corpora.

*Ana Kostovska, Carola Doerr, Sa≈°o D≈æeroski, Panƒçe Panov, Tome Eftimov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using graph neural networks and heterogeneous graph structures to predict optimization algorithm performance, outperforming traditional tabular methods by up to 36.6% in MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for algorithm performance prediction overlook algorithm configurations, which are crucial for performance. The paper addresses this gap by modeling complex dependencies between problems, configurations, and outcomes as a graph.

Method: The study uses heterogeneous graph data structures and graph neural networks to capture dependencies. It evaluates modular frameworks (modCMA-ES and modDE) on BBOB problems across various runtime budgets and dimensions.

Result: The approach achieves up to 36.6% improvement in mean squared error (MSE) over traditional tabular-based methods.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of geometric learning in black-box optimization, offering a more accurate performance prediction method.

Abstract: Automated algorithm performance prediction in numerical blackbox optimization
often relies on problem characterizations, such as exploratory landscape
analysis features. These features are typically used as inputs to machine
learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such
approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing
performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem
characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best
represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data
structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization
algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm
configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks,
modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free
optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576
modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem
dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional
tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning
in black-box optimization.

### [350] [Large Language Models are Near-Optimal Decision-Makers with a Non-Human Learning Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16163)
*Hao Li, Gengrui Zhang, Petter Holme, Shuyue Hu, Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans in decision-making tasks involving uncertainty, risk, and adaptability, but their decision processes differ fundamentally from humans, raising concerns about their use as substitutes for human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs learn and execute decision-making compared to humans, especially in dimensions like uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting.

Method: Benchmarked five leading LLMs against 360 humans using three experimental psychology tasks.

Result: LLMs often outperformed humans, achieving near-optimal performance, but their decision-making processes were fundamentally different.

Conclusion: While LLMs excel in decision-making, their divergence from human processes calls for caution and further research before relying on them as substitutes for human judgment.

Abstract: Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and
civilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be
delegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making;
however, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans,
remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making
behavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world
decision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three
well-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these
dimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants.
Across all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal
performance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged
fundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates
the ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to
changes. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on
them as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.

### [351] [Approximation Fixpoint Theory with Refined Approximation Spaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16294)
*Linde Vanbesien, Bart Bogaerts, Marc Denecker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends consistent Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) by introducing more refined approximation spaces to overcome its limitations in certain non-monotonic reasoning formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFT has limitations in handling some simple examples despite its broad applicability in non-monotonic reasoning. The paper aims to address these limitations by refining approximation spaces.

Method: The authors generalize approximation spaces beyond intervals, introducing a more flexible framework for approximating fixpoints in non-monotonic operators.

Result: The extended AFT framework demonstrates improved expressiveness and explores relationships between different approximation spaces.

Conclusion: The refined approximation spaces enhance AFT's applicability, overcoming previous limitations and broadening its utility in non-monotonic reasoning.

Abstract: Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) is a powerful theory covering various
semantics of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms in knowledge representation
such as Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming. Many semantics of such
non-monotonic formalisms can be characterized as suitable fixpoints of a
non-monotonic operator on a suitable lattice. Instead of working on the
original lattice, AFT operates on intervals in such lattice to approximate or
construct the fixpoints of interest. While AFT has been applied successfully
across a broad range of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, it is confronted by
its limitations in other, relatively simple, examples. In this paper, we
overcome those limitations by extending consistent AFT to deal with
approximations that are more refined than intervals. Therefore, we introduce a
more general notion of approximation spaces, showcase the improved
expressiveness and investigate relations between different approximation
spaces.

### [352] [Explainable Rule Application via Structured Prompting: A Neural-Symbolic Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16335)
*Albert Sadowski, Jaros≈Çaw A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A structured prompting framework combines neural and symbolic methods to improve LLMs' rule-based reasoning, achieving high performance in legal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with consistent rule application and explainability in domains like legal analysis, requiring a hybrid approach for better performance.

Method: Decomposes reasoning into entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application, integrating neural flexibility with formal verification.

Result: Outperformed baselines on LegalBench, with F1 scores of 0.929 (o1) and 0.867 (o3-mini) vs. few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74.

Conclusion: The hybrid system enhances transparent, consistent reasoning, showing promise for explainable AI in legal tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but struggle
with consistent rule application, exception handling, and explainability,
particularly in domains like legal analysis that require both natural language
understanding and precise logical inference. This paper introduces a structured
prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps:
entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By
integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs'
interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal
verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain
experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture.
Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach
significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing
substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini
reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates,
compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively. This
hybrid neural-symbolic system offers a promising pathway for transparent and
consistent rule-based reasoning, suggesting potential for explainable AI
applications in structured legal reasoning tasks.

### [353] [IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16402)
*Xiaoya Lu, Zeren Chen, Xuhao Hu, Yijin Zhou, Weichen Zhang, Dongrui Liu, Lu Sheng, Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IS-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating interactive safety in VLM-driven embodied agents, addressing dynamic risks and mitigation steps in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods fail to assess dynamic risks in interactive environments, posing safety hazards for embodied agents.

Method: Proposes IS-Bench, a multi-modal benchmark with 161 scenarios and 388 safety risks, enabling process-oriented evaluation of risk mitigation.

Result: Experiments show current VLMs lack interactive safety awareness; safety-aware Chain-of-Thought helps but may hinder task completion.

Conclusion: IS-Bench lays groundwork for safer embodied AI by exposing critical safety limitations in current agents.

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety
hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However,
existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess
risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic
risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc
evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive
emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We
thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive
safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks
instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel
process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are
performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on
leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current
agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware
Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.
By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for
developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

*Sami Abboud, Eleanor Hanna, Olivier Jeunen, Vineesha Raheja, Schaun Wheeler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated approach to optimize consumer communication, replacing manual marketer work with a sequential decision-making framework for personalized engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual orchestration of consumer communication is labor-intensive and limits personalization. The paper aims to automate and optimize this process.

Method: Uses a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual Treatment Effect estimation and Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Significant increases in engagement across multiple product features, deployed for 150 million users.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively automates and personalizes consumer communication, improving engagement at scale.

Abstract: Consumer applications provide ample opportunities to surface and communicate
various forms of content to users. From promotional campaigns for new features
or subscriptions, to evergreen nudges for engagement, or personalised
recommendations; across e-mails, push notifications, and in-app surfaces. The
conventional approach to orchestration for communication relies heavily on
labour-intensive manual marketer work, and inhibits effective personalisation
of content, timing, frequency, and copy-writing. We formulate this task under a
sequential decision-making framework, where we aim to optimise a modular
decision-making policy that maximises incremental engagement for any funnel
event. Our approach leverages a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual
Treatment Effect estimation, and Thompson sampling to balance the
explore-exploit trade-off. We present results from a multi-service application,
where our methodology has resulted in significant increases to a variety of
goal events across several product features, and is currently deployed across
150 million users.

*Zexi Liu, Yuzhu Cai, Xinyu Zhu, Yujie Zheng, Runkun Chen, Ying Wen, Yanfeng Wang, Weinan E, Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ML-Master, an AI4AI agent, integrates exploration and reasoning with a memory mechanism, outperforming existing methods by 29.3% in efficiency and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven development (AI4AI) is more efficient than human-centric approaches, but current LLM-based agents struggle to leverage accumulated experience, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: ML-Master employs a selectively scoped memory mechanism to combine insights from parallel solution trajectories with analytical reasoning.

Result: ML-Master achieves a 29.3% average medal rate on MLE-Bench, surpassing baselines, especially in medium-complexity tasks, within half the time.

Conclusion: ML-Master shows promise as a powerful tool for advancing AI4AI by improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level
performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes
more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this
transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate
and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves.
While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are
often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the
exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies
and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a
novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by
employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master
to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories
with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the
agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it
achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods,
particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior
performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used
by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a
powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

### [356] [Advancing Harmful Content Detection in Organizational Research: Integrating Large Language Models with Elo Rating System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16575)
*Mustafa Akben, Aaron Satko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Elo rating-based method to improve LLM performance for analyzing harmful content, outperforming traditional techniques in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' built-in moderation systems hinder analysis of harmful content like microaggressions and hate speech, affecting research validity.

Method: An Elo rating-based method is proposed to enhance LLM performance for harmful content analysis.

Result: The method outperforms traditional LLM prompting and ML models in accuracy, precision, and F1 scores on microaggression and hate speech datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reliability, reduces false positives, and supports applications like workplace harassment detection and fostering inclusive environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational
research. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when
researchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain
instructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of
the results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational
conflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo
rating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful
content analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and
the other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM
prompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures
such as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better
reliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater
scalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational
applications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic
communication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge resource in AI, addressing gaps in current systems like large language models and robotic planning. It proposes a community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure, leveraging modern technology and open engineering frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical deficiency in AI infrastructure caused by the lack of verifiable, general-purpose knowledge resources, which impacts areas like language models, robotic planning, and misinformation detection.

Method: The paper synthesizes findings from a AAAI workshop with over 50 researchers, proposing a community-driven approach to develop a new knowledge infrastructure. It suggests leveraging modern knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, along with an open engineering framework for practical applications.

Result: The result is a proposed vision for a new knowledge infrastructure, including conventions and social structures for contributors, to address current AI knowledge gaps.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of a collaborative, open framework to build a comprehensive knowledge resource, addressing AI's current limitations and enabling future advancements.

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge
resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite
the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and
other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available
sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large
language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks
necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information
relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most
needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and
evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore
these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a
community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to
leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one
promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge
modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a
framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are
adopted by contributors.

### [358] [The Role of Explanation Styles and Perceived Accuracy on Decision Making in Predictive Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16617)
*Soobin Chae, Suhwan Lee, Hanna Hauptmann, Hajo A. Reijers, Xixi Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores how explanation styles and perceived AI accuracy affect decision-making in Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), finding both factors significantly influence user decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in PPM lack interpretability, reducing user trust. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this, but current evaluations overlook user-centered impacts.

Method: A decision-making experiment tested users with AI predictions, perceived accuracy levels, and different explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, counterfactual).

Result: Perceived accuracy and explanation style significantly impact decision-making, affecting task performance, agreement, and decision confidence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of user-centered XAI evaluations in PPM, showing that explanation styles and perceived accuracy shape decision-making outcomes.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) often uses deep learning models to
predict the future behavior of ongoing processes, such as predicting process
outcomes. While these models achieve high accuracy, their lack of
interpretability undermines user trust and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to address this challenge by providing the reasoning behind the predictions.
However, current evaluations of XAI in PPM focus primarily on functional
metrics (such as fidelity), overlooking user-centered aspects such as their
effect on task performance and decision-making. This study investigates the
effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, and
counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low or high) on decision-making in
PPM. We conducted a decision-making experiment, where users were presented with
the AI predictions, perceived accuracy levels, and explanations of different
styles. Users' decisions were measured both before and after receiving
explanations, allowing the assessment of objective metrics (Task Performance
and Agreement) and subjective metrics (Decision Confidence). Our findings show
that perceived accuracy and explanation style have a significant effect.

*Kenjiro Ide, Taiga Someya, Kohei Kawaguchi, Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores low-dimensional, rule-based models for football tactics, using interpretable state variables to predict pass success, validated with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for football tactics are either computationally expensive, lack interpretability, or ignore some player states. This study aims to address these gaps.

Method: The study uses spatiotemporal data to define interpretable state variables for players and trains an XGBoost model with StatsBomb and SkillCorner data to predict pass success.

Result: Key factors like distance to the ball and space score were identified as significant for pass success. The model is interpretable and practical for tactical analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed low-dimensional, rule-based model effectively captures football tactics, offering interpretability and practical decision-making support.

Abstract: Understanding football tactics is crucial for managers and analysts. Previous
research has proposed models based on spatial and kinematic equations, but
these are computationally expensive. Also, Reinforcement learning approaches
use player positions and velocities but lack interpretability and require large
datasets. Rule-based models align with expert knowledge but have not fully
considered all players' states. This study explores whether low-dimensional,
rule-based models using spatiotemporal data can effectively capture football
tactics. Our approach defines interpretable state variables for both the
ball-holder and potential pass receivers, based on criteria that explore
options like passing. Through discussions with a manager, we identified key
variables representing the game state. We then used StatsBomb event data and
SkillCorner tracking data from the 2023$/$24 LaLiga season to train an XGBoost
model to predict pass success. The analysis revealed that the distance between
the player and the ball, as well as the player's space score, were key factors
in determining successful passes. Our interpretable low-dimensional modeling
facilitates tactical analysis through the use of intuitive variables and
provides practical value as a tool to support decision-making in football.

### [360] [Incentivizing High-quality Participation From Federated Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16731)
*Jinlong Pang, Jiaheng Wei, Yifan Hua, Chen Qian, Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an incentive-aware framework for federated learning (FL) to address challenges of voluntary participation and data heterogeneity, using Wasserstein distance and a two-stage Stackelberg game model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL research assumes voluntary participation and ignores data heterogeneity, leading to potential opt-outs or low-quality contributions. The paper aims to incentivize truthful participation and improve model quality.

Method: The framework uses Wasserstein distance to measure data heterogeneity and reformulates convergence bounds. It employs peer prediction for truthful reporting and a Stackelberg game to model interactions and ensure equilibrium.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show the framework's effectiveness in accelerating convergence and improving model quality.

Conclusion: The proposed incentive-aware framework successfully addresses participation and data heterogeneity challenges in FL, enhancing collaboration and model performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating
collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model
without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers
from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish
participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the
system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From
the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be
unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for
data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by
contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware
framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to
accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion
of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and
reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful
reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of
any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score
functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that
formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed mechanism.

*Yanchen Zhu, Honghui Zou, Chufan Liu, Yuyu Luo, Yuankai Wu, Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid charging infrastructure (fixed and mobile chargers) optimized via deep reinforcement learning and MPC-based demand prediction, improving availability and reducing user inconvenience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic charging demand causes underutilization or congestion in fixed charging stations; mobile chargers offer flexibility but require optimal integration with fixed infrastructure.

Method: Introduces the HCSPO problem, combining fixed charger planning and mobile charger scheduling using deep reinforcement learning and heuristic techniques.

Result: Case studies show improved charging availability and reduced user inconvenience compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Hybrid infrastructure with optimized planning and operation is effective for dynamic urban charging demands.

Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification, which brings significant societal and
environmental benefits, is contingent upon the availability of efficient and
adaptable charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations
often face issues like underutilization or congestion due to the dynamic nature
of charging demand. Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution,
capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper
addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging
infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road
networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation
(HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration
of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic
operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model
grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve
the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented
with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of
fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case
studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces
user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines.

TL;DR: The paper explores geographic biases in image generation models (FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5) when generating USA-related images, revealing a bias toward metropolis-like areas and issues with European-sounding names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the geographic knowledge and biases embedded in state-of-the-art image generation models when applied to urban analysis and design.

Method: Generated 150 synthetic images per USA state and capital using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, analyzed similarity using DINO-v2 ViT-S/14 and Fr√©chet Inception Distances.

Result: Models show implicit geographic learning but exhibit strong bias toward metropolis-like areas and disambiguation issues with European-sounding names.

Conclusion: Image generation models have geographic biases and limitations, highlighting the need for addressing representational fairness in such applications.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis
and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a
limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases
they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in
the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two
state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2
ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity
between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly
learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image
for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a
strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states
and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models
systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding
names like Frankfort or Devon.

TL;DR: A heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments is proposed by extending a BBO approach using an Ising machine, addressing limitations of conventional MAB algorithms in combinatorial optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time systems in dynamic environments require optimization of discrete variables, but conventional MAB algorithms fail due to the combinatorial explosion of actions.

Method: Extends a BBO method using an Ising machine to explore actions while accounting for variable interactions and environmental changes.

Result: Demonstrated dynamic adaptability in a wireless communication system with moving users.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes dynamic, discrete environments where traditional MAB algorithms fall short.

Abstract: Many real-time systems require the optimization of discrete variables.
Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms
perform optimization by repeatedly taking actions and observing the
corresponding instant rewards without any prior knowledge. Recently, a BBO
method using an Ising machine has been proposed to find the best action that is
represented by a combination of discrete values and maximizes the instant
reward in static environments. In contrast, dynamic environments, where
real-time systems operate, necessitate MAB algorithms that maximize the average
reward over multiple trials. However, due to the enormous number of actions
resulting from the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization, conventional
MAB algorithms cannot effectively optimize dynamic, discrete environments.
Here, we show a heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments by
extending the BBO method, in which an Ising machine effectively explores the
actions while considering interactions between variables and changes in dynamic
environments. We demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method in
a wireless communication system with moving users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate and efficient task planning for mobile robots in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental monitoring, where GTSP is a key problem.

Method: Introduces a coordinate-based image builder, adaptive resolution scaling, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate geometric and spatial features.

Result: MMFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in GTSP instances and maintains computational efficiency for real-time applications, validated by physical robot tests.

Conclusion: The MMFL framework effectively solves GTSP in robotic task planning, demonstrating practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Effective and efficient task planning is essential for mobile robots,
especially in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental
monitoring. These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of
several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem
(GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To
address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that
leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary
aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality
task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a
coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially
informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling
strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a
multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective
integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that
our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required
for real-time robotic applications. Physical robot tests further validate its
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) algorithm for Mahjong bots, enhancing proficiency and preserving play styles with minimal changes to Proximal Policy Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for developing competent bots with diverse play styles are under-explored, and Mahjong's randomness challenges offline learning and LfD algorithms.

Method: The authors propose a modified LfD algorithm using gameplay histories of Mahjong agents, requiring minimal adjustments to Proximal Policy Optimization.

Result: Empirical results show the method significantly improves bot proficiency while maintaining distinct play styles.

Conclusion: The novel LfD algorithm effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods in Mahjong, balancing performance and style diversity.

Abstract: A wide variety of bots in games enriches the gameplay experience and enhances
replayability. Recent advancements in game artificial intelligence have
predominantly focused on improving the proficiency of bots. Nevertheless,
developing highly competent bots with a wide range of distinct play styles
remains a relatively under-explored area. We select the Mahjong game
environment as a case study. The high degree of randomness inherent in the
Mahjong game and the prevalence of out-of-distribution states lead to
suboptimal performance of existing offline learning and
Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) algorithms. In this paper, we leverage the
gameplay histories of existing Mahjong agents and put forward a novel LfD
algorithm that necessitates only minimal modifications to the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm. The comprehensive empirical results illustrate that our
proposed method not only significantly enhances the proficiency of the agents
but also effectively preserves their unique play styles.

Abstract: Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is pivotal in Industry 4.0 and 5.0, proactively
enhancing efficiency through accurate equipment Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction, thus optimizing maintenance scheduling and reducing unexpected
failures and premature interventions. This paper introduces a novel RUL
estimation approach leveraging State Space Models (SSM) for efficient long-term
sequence modeling. To handle model uncertainty, Simoultaneous Quantile
Regression (SQR) is integrated into the SSM, enabling multiple quantile
estimations. The proposed method is benchmarked against traditional sequence
modelling techniques (LSTM, Transformer, Informer) using the C-MAPSS dataset.

TL;DR: The paper critiques BFO 2020 for lacking support for functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent continuants (e.g., software, datasets) and proposes two solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BFO 2020's inability to represent these aspects limits its utility, especially for modeling functions of computer models or roles of datasets during execution.

Method: The paper analyzes BFO 2020's limitations and presents two approaches: using defined classes and proposing changes to BFO.

Result: The analysis highlights the issue and offers potential solutions to enhance BFO's capability.

Conclusion: Addressing these limitations would improve BFO's applicability for representing generically dependent continuants.

Abstract: BFO 2020 does not support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically
dependent continuants (like software or datasets). In this paper, we argue that
this is a severe limitation, which prevents, for example, the adequate
representation of the functions of computer models or the various roles of
datasets during the execution of these models. We discuss the aspects of BFO
2020 that prevent the representation of realizable entities of generically
dependent continuants. Two approaches to address the issue are presented: (a)
the use of defined classes and (b) a proposal of changes that allow BFO to
support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent
continuants.

TL;DR: DREAM enhances LLMs' multi-step FOL reasoning by diversifying strategies and correcting errors, improving performance by 0.6%-6.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step FOL reasoning due to limited proof diversity and early errors, as shown by low accuracy (4.2%) on theorem proving tasks.

Method: DREAM introduces Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification and Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to improve reasoning diversity and correctness.

Result: DREAM improves LLM performance by 0.6% to 6.4% on theorem proving, with a dataset of 447 Lean 4 theorems for evaluation.

Conclusion: DREAM advances LLMs' mathematical reasoning by addressing diversity and error correction, offering a scalable solution for complex FOL tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL)
reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their
effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL
deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on
established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step
FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on
our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited
exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning
mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM,
a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs'
generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy
Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a
Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their
proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical
reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage
solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated
dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of benchmarks for evaluating bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), showing that different evaluation methods yield inconsistent model rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of independent benchmarks used for evaluating LLM safety, particularly bias, given their varied approaches and datasets.

Method: Investigates robustness by comparing rankings of representative models for bias using different evaluation methods.

Result: Different widely used bias evaluation methods produce disparate model rankings.

Conclusion: Recommends cautious usage of such benchmarks due to their inconsistent results.

Abstract: The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is
one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks
allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity,
bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches
with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such
benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative
models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that
different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model
rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of
such benchmarks.

*Dadi Guo, Jiayu Liu, Zhiyuan Fan, Zhitao He, Haoran Li, Yumeng Wang, Yi R., Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RFMDataset to evaluate large reasoning models' performance on mathematical proofs, revealing significant shortcomings like low correctness rates, diverse reasoning failures, and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose hidden reasoning failures in large models, which are often masked by high accuracy on numerical evaluations and potential benchmark leakage.

Method: The authors create the RFMDataset with 200 diverse proof problems and analyze model performance, identifying 10 fine-grained error types.

Result: Models struggle with proofs (some <20% correct), exhibit diverse reasoning failures, and lack guarantees for correctness or rigor in single-step reasoning.

Conclusion: Current models' self-reflection is insufficient; formalized, fine-grained logical training is needed to address these limitations.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable
mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of
these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical
evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning
shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and
methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose
these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal
Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and
thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis
of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental
limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models
grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely
correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2)
models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently
demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of
single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness
during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection
is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating
formalized and fine-grained logical training.

### [371] [When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17124)
*Josiah P. Hanna, Nicholas E. Corrado*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how model-free RL can lead to "thinking" behaviors in agents, introduces a theoretical "thought MDP" model, and validates findings with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why model-free RL results in "thinking" strategies for reward maximization, despite such actions not directly affecting rewards or world states.

Method: Introduces a "thought MDP" model to abstractly represent thought states and actions, analyzes policy initialization's role, and tests conditions with LLMs.

Result: Proves thought actions equate to policy improvement steps, shows LLMs meet necessary conditions for thinking-like behavior, and hypothesizes broader applicability.

Conclusion: Model-free RL can produce thinking-like behavior under specific conditions, with potential applications beyond language generation.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence
of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither
produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is
more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent
understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for
reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a
theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process}
(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an
abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP
model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether
or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent
to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing
to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our
theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like
behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable
thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy
domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought
actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

### [372] [Chain-of-Trust: A Progressive Trust Evaluation Framework Enabled by Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17130)
*Botao Zhu, Xianbin Wang, Lei Zhang, Xuemin, Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A progressive trust evaluation framework, chain-of-trust, is proposed to handle misaligned device attribute data in collaborative systems, improving accuracy and reducing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of comprehensive trust assessment due to network dynamics and varying data latencies in collaborative systems.

Method: Divides trust evaluation into chained stages, gathering relevant data per stage, and uses generative AI for analysis.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in trust evaluation with reduced complexity.

Conclusion: The chain-of-trust framework effectively improves trust assessment in dynamic collaborative environments.

Abstract: In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources,
trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective
mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying
information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and
collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a
comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust
evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of
misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task
completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages
based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion
process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant
to that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By
leveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning
capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the
collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices
deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.
The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
high accuracy in trust evaluation.

*Abinitha Gourabathina, Yuexing Hao, Walter Gerych, Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedPerturb dataset evaluates medical LLMs under controlled perturbations, revealing differences in sensitivity to gender, style, and format changes between LLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how LLMs and humans differ in handling real-world clinical variability, ensuring clinical robustness for safe deployment.

Method: Introduce MedPerturb, a dataset of 800 clinical vignettes perturbed along gender, style, and format axes, comparing outputs of four LLMs and human experts.

Result: LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style changes, while humans are more sensitive to format changes like summaries.

Conclusion: Evaluation frameworks must account for clinical variability to align LLM decisions with human clinicians.

Abstract: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large
Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may
differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings.
To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically
evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input.
MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each
transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping
or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial
tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or
summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts
grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three
human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies
to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect
diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are
more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are
more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical
summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go
beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and
LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Semantic Communication (GSC), an AGI-driven paradigm for efficient data delivery, leveraging AI to reduce communication costs and support human-friendly interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demands for AGI services and the need for efficient, human-understandable communication drive the development of GSC.

Method: Proposes a GSC framework using advanced AI technologies like foundation and generative models, with case studies to validate its advantages.

Result: GSC demonstrates potential for efficient semantic communication, supported by case studies.

Conclusion: GSC presents a promising direction for AGI-driven communication, though open challenges remain for practical implementation.

Abstract: Semantic communications leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to
extract semantic information for efficient data delivery, thereby significantly
reducing communication cost. With the evolution towards artificial general
intelligence (AGI), the increasing demands for AGI services pose new challenges
to semantic communications. In this context, an AGI application is typically
defined on a general-sense task, covering a broad, even unforeseen, set of
objectives, as well as driven by the need for a human-friendly interface in
forms (e.g., videos, images, or text) easily understood by human users.In
response, we introduce an AGI-driven communication paradigm for supporting AGI
applications, called generative semantic communication (GSC). We first describe
the basic concept of GSC and its difference from existing semantic
communications, and then introduce a general framework of GSC based on advanced
AI technologies including foundation models and generative models. Two case
studies are presented to verify the advantages of GSC. Finally, open challenges
and new research directions are discussed to stimulate this line of research
and pave the way for practical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Alto is a framework optimizing compound AI queries with streaming and parallelism, using nested ancestry for metadata tracking, improving latency by 10-30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle with parallelism and pipelining in compound AI due to heterogeneous component constraints and dynamic data generation.

Method: Alto introduces nested ancestry, a metadata hierarchy for tracking and aggregating data across components, inferred automatically from the programming model.

Result: Alto implementations outperform or match LangGraph, reducing latency by 10-30% in four applications.

Conclusion: Alto effectively optimizes compound AI queries, simplifying complex dataflow patterns for developers.

Abstract: Compound AI applications chain together subcomponents such as generative
language models, document retrievers, and embedding models. Applying
traditional systems optimizations such as parallelism and pipelining in
compound AI systems is difficult because each component has different
constraints in terms of the granularity and type of data that it ingests. New
data is often generated during intermediate computations, and text streams may
be split into smaller, independent fragments (such as documents to sentences)
which may then be re-aggregated at later parts of the computation. Due to this
complexity, existing systems to serve compound AI queries do not fully take
advantage of parallelism and pipelining opportunities.
  We present Alto, a framework that automatically optimizes execution of
compound AI queries through streaming and parallelism. Bento introduces a new
abstraction called nested ancestry, a metadata hierarchy that allows the system
to correctly track partial outputs and aggregate data across the heterogeneous
constraints of the components of compound AI applications. This metadata is
automatically inferred from the programming model, allowing developers to
express complex dataflow patterns without needing to reason manually about the
details of routing and aggregation. Implementations of four applications in
Alto outperform or match implementations in LangGraph, a popular existing AI
programming framework. Alto implementations match or improve latency by between
10-30%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAECIPS is a framework combining edge-cloud collaboration and large vision models for robotic visual inspection in smart manufacturing, improving accuracy and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high accuracy and low latency in robotic visual inspection for dynamic manufacturing environments.

Method: LAECIPS decouples large vision models in the cloud from lightweight edge models, using hard input mining to route tasks adaptively.

Result: Significant improvements in accuracy, latency, and communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LAECIPS offers a scalable solution for embodied intelligence in smart manufacturing, particularly for adaptive inspection and quality control.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence (EI) enables manufacturing systems to flexibly
perceive, reason, adapt, and operate within dynamic shop floor environments. In
smart manufacturing, a representative EI scenario is robotic visual inspection,
where industrial robots must accurately inspect components on rapidly changing,
heterogeneous production lines. This task requires both high inference accuracy
especially for uncommon defects and low latency to match production speeds,
despite evolving lighting, part geometries, and surface conditions. To meet
these needs, we propose LAECIPS, a large vision model-assisted adaptive
edge-cloud collaboration framework for IoT-based embodied intelligence systems.
LAECIPS decouples large vision models in the cloud from lightweight models on
the edge, enabling plug-and-play model adaptation and continual learning.
Through a hard input mining-based inference strategy, LAECIPS routes complex
and uncertain inspection cases to the cloud while handling routine tasks at the
edge, achieving both high accuracy and low latency. Experiments conducted on a
real-world robotic semantic segmentation system for visual inspection
demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, processing latency, and
communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods. LAECIPS provides a
practical and scalable foundation for embodied intelligence in smart
manufacturing, especially in adaptive robotic inspection and quality control
scenarios.

*Mustafa F Abdelwahed, Joan Espasa, Alice Toniolo, Ian P. Gent*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to diverse planning using an n-dimensional grid for expressive diversity modeling and a toolkit called Behaviour Planning, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diverse planning methods are limited in encoding diversity and explaining plan differences.

Method: Proposes an n-dimensional grid representation for diversity and a toolkit (Behaviour Planning) using planning-as-satisfiability.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Behaviour Planning outperforms current methods in generating diverse plans.

Conclusion: The approach supports broader planning categories and offers customizable diversity models.

Abstract: Diverse planning approaches are utilised in real-world applications like risk
management, automated streamed data analysis, and malware detection. The
current diverse planning formulations encode the diversity model as a distance
function, which is computational inexpensive when comparing two plans. However,
such modelling approach limits what can be encoded as measure of diversity, as
well as the ability to explain why two plans are different. This paper
introduces a novel approach to the diverse planning problem, allowing for more
expressive modelling of diversity using a n-dimensional grid representation,
where each dimension corresponds to a user-defined feature. Furthermore, we
present a novel toolkit that generates diverse plans based on such customisable
diversity models, called \emph{Behaviour Planning}. We provide an
implementation for behaviour planning using planning-as-satisfiability. An
empirical evaluation of our implementation shows that behaviour planning
significantly outperforms the current diverse planning method in generating
diverse plans measured on our new customisable diversity models. Our
implementation is the first diverse planning approach to support planning
categories beyond classical planning, such as over-subscription and numerical
planning.

*Simon Werner, Katharina Christ, Laura Bernardy, Marion G. M√ºller, Achim Rettinger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes improving machine learning alignment with individual human expectations by incorporating personal perception patterns, tested via a novel dataset and a Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods rely on population-level data, missing individual context. The authors argue individual perception can enhance predictive performance for specific users.

Method: They integrate perception information into ML systems, using a novel dataset of multimodal stimuli and eye-tracking sequences, and develop a Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer.

Result: Individual perception signals improve predictive performance from the user's POV and align AI systems with personal expectations.

Conclusion: Leveraging individual perception aids in better alignment and performance, potentially steering AI toward personalized expectations and values.

Abstract: Aligning machine learning systems with human expectations is mostly attempted
by training with manually vetted human behavioral samples, typically explicit
feedback. This is done on a population level since the context that is
capturing the subjective Point-Of-View (POV) of a concrete person in a specific
situational context is not retained in the data. However, we argue that
alignment on an individual level can boost the subjective predictive
performance for the individual user interacting with the system considerably.
Since perception differs for each person, the same situation is observed
differently. Consequently, the basis for decision making and the subsequent
reasoning processes and observable reactions differ. We hypothesize that
individual perception patterns can be used for improving the alignment on an
individual level. We test this, by integrating perception information into
machine learning systems and measuring their predictive performance
wrt.~individual subjective assessments. For our empirical study, we collect a
novel data set of multimodal stimuli and corresponding eye tracking sequences
for the novel task of Perception-Guided Crossmodal Entailment and tackle it
with our Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer. Our findings suggest that
exploiting individual perception signals for the machine learning of subjective
human assessments provides a valuable cue for individual alignment. It does not
only improve the overall predictive performance from the point-of-view of the
individual user but might also contribute to steering AI systems towards every
person's individual expectations and values.

TL;DR: CLOVER is a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology, using lightweight training and GPT-3.5 prompts to outperform larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like high costs and resource demands in applying vision-language models to clinics.

Method: Trains a lightweight module with instruction tuning, uses GPT-3.5 prompts, and constructs template-based instructions for digital pathology.

Result: Outperforms baselines with fewer parameters, excels in visual Q&A, and shows robustness in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: CLOVER's cost-effective approach can accelerate conversational AI adoption in digital pathology.

Abstract: The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations
between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics
must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial,
and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction
learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only
trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the
parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we
propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based
instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from
the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a
high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital
pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of
hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive
results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and
closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess
37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from
GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot
learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that
cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid
conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using algebraic circuit complexity to quantify algorithmic reasoning in AI systems, addressing the lack of a theoretical framework for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems lack interpretability and reliability in algorithmic reasoning, despite their fluency in other domains. Existing benchmarks lack a theoretical foundation.

Method: Adopts algebraic circuit complexity theory to formalize algorithmic generalization, using algebraic expressions as circuit models.

Result: Introduces a framework to study generalization by defining benchmarks based on computational requirements, leveraging algebraic circuits for scalable experimentation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a theoretical foundation for quantifying algorithmic reasoning in AI, addressing key challenges in AI science.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has created an
urgent need for their scientific quantification. While their fluency across a
variety of domains is impressive, AI systems fall short on tests requiring
algorithmic reasoning -- a glaring limitation given the necessity for
interpretable and reliable technology. Despite a surge of reasoning benchmarks
emerging from the academic community, no theoretical framework exists to
quantify algorithmic reasoning in AI systems. Here, we adopt a framework from
computational complexity theory to quantify algorithmic generalization using
algebraic expressions: algebraic circuit complexity. Algebraic circuit
complexity theory -- the study of algebraic expressions as circuit models -- is
a natural framework to study the complexity of algorithmic computation.
Algebraic circuit complexity enables the study of generalization by defining
benchmarks in terms of the computational requirements to solve a problem.
Moreover, algebraic circuits are generic mathematical objects; an arbitrarily
large number of samples can be generated for a specified circuit, making it an
ideal experimental sandbox for the data-hungry models that are used today. In
this Perspective, we adopt tools from algebraic circuit complexity, apply them
to formalize a science of algorithmic generalization, and address key
challenges for its successful application to AI science.

*M√©lanie Roschewitz, Raghav Mehta, Charles Jones, Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised framework to identify types of dataset shifts (prevalence, covariate, mixed) in clinical AI models, improving shift detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data distribution shifts harm clinical AI performance, but existing methods only detect shifts without identifying their types, limiting mitigation strategies.

Method: Uses self-supervised encoders and task model outputs to distinguish between prevalence, covariate, and mixed shifts in imaging datasets.

Result: Effective across three imaging modalities and five real-world dataset shifts, demonstrating improved shift identification.

Conclusion: The framework enhances shift detection precision, aiding targeted mitigation strategies for clinical AI models.

Abstract: Shifts in data distribution can substantially harm the performance of
clinical AI models and lead to misdiagnosis. Hence, various methods have been
developed to detect the presence of such shifts at deployment time. However,
the root causes of dataset shifts are diverse, and the choice of shift
mitigation strategies is highly dependent on the precise type of shift
encountered at test time. As such, detecting test-time dataset shift is not
sufficient: precisely identifying which type of shift has occurred is critical.
In this work, we propose the first unsupervised dataset shift identification
framework for imaging datasets, effectively distinguishing between prevalence
shift (caused by a change in the label distribution), covariate shift (caused
by a change in input characteristics) and mixed shifts (simultaneous prevalence
and covariate shifts). We discuss the importance of self-supervised encoders
for detecting subtle covariate shifts and propose a novel shift detector
leveraging both self-supervised encoders and task model outputs for improved
shift detection. We show the effectiveness of the proposed shift identification
framework across three different imaging modalities (chest radiography, digital
mammography, and retinal fundus images) on five types of real-world dataset

### [382] [AutoSculpt: A Pattern-based Model Auto-pruning Framework Using Reinforcement Learning and Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18091)
*Lixian Jing, Jianpeng Qi, Junyu Dong, Yanwei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoSculpt is a pattern-based automated pruning framework using graph learning and DRL to optimize DNNs for edge devices, achieving high pruning rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing DNNs for edge devices is challenging due to model diversity and pruning-accuracy trade-offs.

Method: AutoSculpt constructs DNNs as graphs, embeds pruning patterns, and uses DRL to refine pruning strategies.

Result: Achieves up to 90% pruning rates and 18% FLOPs reduction, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: AutoSculpt effectively balances compression and accuracy, enhancing DNN efficiency for edge deployment.

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed on edge devices,
optimizing models for constrained computational resources is critical. Existing
auto-pruning methods face challenges due to the diversity of DNN models,
various operators (e.g., filters), and the difficulty in balancing pruning
granularity with model accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce
AutoSculpt, a pattern-based automated pruning framework designed to enhance
efficiency and accuracy by leveraging graph learning and deep reinforcement
learning (DRL). AutoSculpt automatically identifies and prunes regular patterns
within DNN architectures that can be recognized by existing inference engines,
enabling runtime acceleration. Three key steps in AutoSculpt include: (1)
Constructing DNNs as graphs to encode their topology and parameter
dependencies, (2) embedding computationally efficient pruning patterns, and (3)
utilizing DRL to iteratively refine auto-pruning strategies until the optimal
balance between compression and accuracy is achieved. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSculpt across various architectures,
including ResNet, MobileNet, VGG, and Vision Transformer, achieving pruning
rates of up to 90% and nearly 18% improvement in FLOPs reduction, outperforming
all baselines. The codes can be available at

*Haokun Zhao, Jinyi Han, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Xiaojun Meng, Jiansheng Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS), a method to improve LLM performance by refining evaluations and targeting weaknesses for data synthesis, achieving notable benchmark improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods lack fine-grained insights, limiting effective data synthesis for LLM improvement.

Method: CDS uses Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) for detailed model profiling and employs diagnosis-synthesis strategies and enhanced data augmentation.

Result: Experiments show improvements: 6.00% in code generation, 13.10% in math reasoning, and 5.43% in academic exams.

Conclusion: CDS effectively enhances LLM performance by refining evaluations and targeted data synthesis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements, but the
increasing complexity of tasks and higher performance demands highlight the
need for continuous improvement. Some approaches utilize synthetic data
generated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models.
However, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained
profiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we
introduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a
diagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine
evaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component
level. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis
strategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an
enhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and
diversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models
show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00%
improvement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in
academic exams. Code and data are available on GitHub.

*Alan Chan, Kevin Wei, Sihao Huang, Nitarshan Rajkumar, Elija Perrier, Seth Lazar, Gillian K. Hadfield, Markus Anderljung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'agent infrastructure'‚Äîexternal systems and protocols to mediate AI agent interactions, addressing trust, communication, and safety in open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous AI agents need protocols for interaction and trust, as direct behavioral modifications alone are insufficient.

Method: Introduces the concept of agent infrastructure with three functions: action attribution, interaction shaping, and harm detection/remediation.

Result: Identifies research directions for agent infrastructure, analyzing use cases, adoption, and limitations.

Conclusion: Agent infrastructure is essential for advanced AI ecosystems, akin to internet protocols, and requires further research.

Abstract: AI agents plan and execute interactions in open-ended environments. For
example, OpenAI's Operator can use a web browser to do product comparisons and
buy online goods. Much research on making agents useful and safe focuses on
directly modifying their behaviour, such as by training them to follow user
instructions. Direct behavioural modifications are useful, but do not fully
address how heterogeneous agents will interact with each other and other
actors. Rather, we will need external protocols and systems to shape such
interactions. For instance, agents will need more efficient protocols to
communicate with each other and form agreements. Attributing an agent's actions
to a particular human or other legal entity can help to establish trust, and
also disincentivize misuse. Given this motivation, we propose the concept of
\textbf{agent infrastructure}: technical systems and shared protocols external
to agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with
and impacts on their environments. Just as the Internet relies on protocols
like HTTPS, our work argues that agent infrastructure will be similarly
indispensable to ecosystems of agents. We identify three functions for agent
infrastructure: 1) attributing actions, properties, and other information to
specific agents, their users, or other actors; 2) shaping agents' interactions;
and 3) detecting and remedying harmful actions from agents. We provide an
incomplete catalog of research directions for such functions. For each
direction, we include analysis of use cases, infrastructure adoption,
relationships to existing (internet) infrastructure, limitations, and open
questions. Making progress on agent infrastructure can prepare society for the
adoption of more advanced agents.

*Zeyu Gan, Yun Liao, Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanisms of external slow-thinking (test-time scaling) in LLMs, linking it to reducing error probability in reasoning. It compares various methods and suggests broader search scope or internal reasoning improvements may be more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the poorly understood mechanisms behind slow-thinking methods in LLMs and their impact on reasoning errors.

Method: Theoretical analysis of snowball errors in LLM reasoning, connecting it to information theory, and comparative analysis of slow-thinking approaches.

Result: External slow-thinking methods mitigate error probability, but efficacy depends more on search scope or internal reasoning capacity than specific frameworks.

Conclusion: Expanding search scope or internal reasoning capacity may offer more sustained improvements in LLM reasoning than specific slow-thinking frameworks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling, which is also often referred to as slow-thinking, has been
demonstrated to enhance multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs).
However, despite its widespread utilization, the mechanisms underlying
slow-thinking methods remain poorly understood. This paper explores the
mechanisms of external slow-thinking from a theoretical standpoint. We begin by
examining the snowball error effect within the LLM reasoning process and
connect it to the likelihood of correct reasoning using information theory.
Building on this, we show that external slow-thinking methods can be
interpreted as strategies to mitigate the error probability. We further provide
a comparative analysis of popular external slow-thinking approaches, ranging
from simple to complex, highlighting their differences and interrelationships.
Our findings suggest that the efficacy of these methods is not primarily
determined by the specific framework employed, and that expanding the search
scope or the model's internal reasoning capacity may yield more sustained
improvements in the long term. We open-source our code at
https://github.com/ZyGan1999/Snowball-Errors-and-Probability.

TL;DR: NatureLM is a unified, sequence-based foundation model for multiple scientific domains, enabling cross-domain applications and outperforming specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for scientific domains operate in isolation, lacking integration. NatureLM addresses this by unifying diverse domains under a single model.

Method: NatureLM is pre-trained on data from multiple scientific domains, representing entities as sequences. It supports tasks like cross-domain generation and optimization.

Result: NatureLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art specialist models, with performance improving as model size increases (1B to 46.7B parameters).

Conclusion: NatureLM is a versatile, generalist model promising for scientific discovery, drug development, and material design.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and
artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and
generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models,
researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains,
including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, RNA and even cells.
However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability
to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities
within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form
the "language of nature", we introduce Nature Language Model (NatureLM), a
sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery.
Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a
unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i)
generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using
text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as
protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) top performance
across different domains, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art specialist
models. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific
tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET
optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of
therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. We have developed NatureLM models in
different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and
observed a clear improvement in performance as the model size increases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PoH integrates LLM self-reflection with Monte Carlo Tree Search to automate heuristic optimization for COPs, outperforming hand-crafted and other LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-designed heuristics for COPs require extensive domain knowledge and testing time, while LLMs offer potential for automated optimization.

Method: PoH combines LLM self-reflection and Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively refine heuristics by evaluating performance and simulating future states for higher rewards.

Result: PoH achieves state-of-the-art performance in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem and Flow Shop Scheduling Problem, especially for large sizes.

Conclusion: PoH demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in automating heuristic optimization for COPs, surpassing traditional and other LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Heuristics have achieved great success in solving combinatorial optimization
problems~(COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain
knowledge and testing time. Since Large Language Models~(LLMs) possess strong
capabilities to understand and generate content with a knowledge base that
covers various domains, they offer potential ways to automatically optimize
heuristics. To this end, we propose Planning of Heuristics~(PoH), an
optimization method that integrates LLM self-reflection with Monte Carlo Tree
Search, a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated
heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement
suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated
heuristics~(states) and improve them based on the improvement
suggestions~(actions) and evaluation results~(rewards), by effectively
simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this
paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Flow Shop
Scheduling Problem. The experimental results show that PoH outperforms
hand-crafted heuristics and other Automatic Heuristic Design methods based on
LLMs, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in automating heuristic
optimization with LLMs to solve tested COPs, especially with large sizes.

We design and evaluate test cases across different real-world environments,
analyzing the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting spatial layouts, handling
user constraints, and planning efficient routes. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of LLMs for supporting personalized indoor navigation, with an
average of 86.59% correct indications and a maximum of 97.14%. The proposed
system achieves high accuracy and reasoning performance. These results have key

TL;DR: LEGO-Puzzles benchmark evaluates MLLMs' spatial reasoning, revealing significant gaps compared to humans, with GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash showing limited success in generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess MLLMs' spatial and sequential reasoning for real-world applications like robotics and navigation.

Method: Introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a VQA benchmark with 1,100 samples across 11 tasks, and evaluate 20 MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs score ~50% accuracy vs. humans' 90%; only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash show limited generation ability.

Conclusion: MLLMs lack robust spatial reasoning, highlighting the need for further advancements in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-step spatial reasoning entails understanding and reasoning about
spatial relationships across multiple sequential steps, which is crucial for
tackling complex real-world applications, such as robotic manipulation,
autonomous navigation, and automated assembly. To assess how well current
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental
capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to
evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through
LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual
question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic
spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles,
we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover
significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most
powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human
participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we
design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial
understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show
that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these
instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate
completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical
deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning
capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal
spatial reasoning.

TL;DR: A structured self-consistency framework improves LLM reliability in mathematical reasoning by enforcing consistency in intermediate steps and final outputs, reducing hallucinations and enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit strong mathematical reasoning but suffer from hallucinations, especially in theorem proving, symbolic manipulation, and numerical computation. Existing self-consistency methods focus on final answers, ignoring intermediate logical consistency.

Method: Introduces a structured self-consistency framework to enforce consistency across reasoning steps and outputs, evaluated on theorem proving, symbolic transformation, and numerical computation.

Result: SC improves proof validity, symbolic reasoning accuracy, and numerical stability while reducing output variance, maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Structured self-consistency enhances LLM reliability in mathematical tasks, offering a path to more interpretable and accurate AI-driven mathematics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning
capabilities but remain susceptible to hallucinations producing plausible yet
incorrect statements especially in theorem proving, symbolic manipulation, and
numerical computation. While self-consistency (SC) has been explored as a means
to improve factuality in LLMs, existing approaches primarily apply SC to
final-answer selection, neglecting the logical consistency of intermediate
reasoning steps. In this work, we introduce a structured self-consistency
framework designed to enhance the reliability of mathematical reasoning. Our
method enforces self-consistency across intermediate steps and final outputs,
reducing logical inconsistencies and hallucinations. We evaluate our approach
across three core mathematical tasks: theorem proving, symbolic transformation,
and numerical computation. Experimental results demonstrate that SC
significantly improves proof validity, symbolic reasoning accuracy, and
numerical stability while maintaining computational efficiency. Further
analysis reveals that structured self-consistency not only enhances
problem-solving accuracy but also reduces the variance of model-generated
outputs. These findings highlight self-consistency as a robust mechanism for
improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and
interpretable AI-driven mathematics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks specialized safety methodologies for embodied agents, necessitating a tailored approach to ensure behavioral safety.

Method: The framework includes taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and evaluation. It introduces EAsafetyBench and Pinpoint, a prompt-decoupled moderation scheme using masked attention.

Result: The approach achieves 94.58% average detection accuracy and 0.002 seconds per instance moderation time, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the safety gap for embodied agents, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Embodied agents exhibit immense potential across a multitude of domains,
making the assurance of their behavioral safety a fundamental prerequisite for
their widespread deployment. However, existing research predominantly
concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking
specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input
moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to
safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline,
including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model
training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a
meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the
training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for
embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative
prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention
mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional
prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse
benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the
proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an
impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of
existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation
processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.

multimodal data analysis by integrating image, audio, and natural language
processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from BWC footage.
The framework incorporates speaker separation, transcription, and large
language models (LLMs) to produce structured, interpretable summaries of
police-civilian encounters. We also employ a custom evaluation pipeline to
assess transcription quality and behavior detection accuracy in high-stakes,
real-world policing scenarios. Our methodology, computational techniques, and

*Maris F. L. Galesloot, Roman Andriushchenko, Milan ƒåe≈°ka, Sebastian Junges, Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) to address non-robustness in POMDP policies. It combines formal verification and subgradient ascent to compute robust policies, showing improved robustness and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal POMDP policies lack robustness against environmental perturbations. HM-POMDPs model uncertainty by considering multiple potential environments, aiming to find policies that perform well across all.

Method: The approach combines deductive formal verification to identify worst-case POMDPs and subgradient ascent to optimize policies for robustness.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the method produces more robust policies, generalizes better to unseen POMDPs, and scales to large HM-POMDPs (over 100,000 environments).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively computes robust policies for HM-POMDPs, outperforming baselines in robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific
environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically,
optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the
environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different
environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space.
The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models,
and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A
policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for
each of its POMDPs.We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal
techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports
tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the
HM-POMDP, and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a
worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various
baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and
generalize better to unseen POMDPs, and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of
over a hundred thousand environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmThinkers is a reinforcement learning framework for atomic-scale simulation, combining physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability by modeling particles as decision-making agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo are accurate but inefficient, while learning-based methods sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. SwarmThinkers aims to unify these qualities.

Method: Particles are modeled as agents using a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism ensures statistical fidelity and interpretability.

Result: Achieves full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single GPU, outperforming supercomputer-based methods with up to 4963x faster computation and 485x lower memory usage.

Conclusion: SwarmThinkers represents a paradigm shift by unifying physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence.

Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by
design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress,
this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo
ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer
efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We
present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts
atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system.
Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that
selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic
constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition
rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise
decision making. Training follows a centralized-training,
decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across
system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a
benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers
is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on
a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer.
It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower
memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers,
SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies
physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven
intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HistBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI's historical reasoning, and HistAgent, a specialized AI agent for history, which outperforms general-purpose LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capabilities of LLMs in humanities, particularly history, due to unique challenges like multimodal interpretation and temporal inference.

Method: Developed HistBench (414 expert-authored questions) and HistAgent (a history-specific AI with tools like OCR, translation, and archival search).

Result: HistAgent (based on GPT-4o) achieved 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, outperforming generalist agents like GPT-4o (18.60%).

Conclusion: Specialized agents like HistAgent are more effective for historical reasoning than general-purpose LLMs, highlighting their limitations in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly
history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for
AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and
cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many
existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage
with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce
HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate
AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert
contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual
retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and
images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or
cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and
modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world
regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we
further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully

### [396] [Revisiting Multi-Agent Debate as Test-Time Scaling: A Systematic Study of Conditional Effectiveness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22960)
*Yongjin Yang, Euiin Yi, Jongwoo Ko, Kimin Lee, Zhijing Jin, Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is explored as a test-time scaling technique, showing limited benefits for math tasks but potential risks and benefits for safety tasks depending on conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand MAD's effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, especially under varying conditions like task difficulty and model scale.

Method: Conceptualizes MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique and conducts empirical comparisons with self-agent baselines on math and safety tasks.

Result: MAD offers limited advantages for math reasoning but becomes more effective with harder problems or weaker models. For safety tasks, MAD can increase vulnerability but benefits from diverse agent configurations.

Conclusion: The findings guide future development of MAD systems by highlighting its conditional effectiveness and strategic deployment needs.

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred
exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a
promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD)
approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine
arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse
perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a
systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,
particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to
fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling
technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration
capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD
with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning
and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of
task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key
findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages
over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem
difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little
benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can
increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations
facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative
refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the
future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

*Jingyi Yang, Shuai Shao, Dongrui Liu, Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIOSWorld, a benchmark to evaluate safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents in real-world scenarios, highlighting significant risks and the need for safety alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety risk evaluations for MLLM-based computer-use agents lack realistic environments or focus narrowly, ignoring real-world complexity and diversity.

Method: RIOSWorld includes 492 risky tasks across various computer applications, categorizing risks into user-originated and environmental, evaluated from intention and completion perspectives.

Result: Experiments show current computer-use agents face significant safety risks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the urgency of safety alignment for trustworthy computer-use agents, with RIOSWorld providing a valuable benchmark.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of
accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the
safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue
scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios?
Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use
agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive
environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These
limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world
environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for
computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world
computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various
computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and
office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on
their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For
the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal
intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal
agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents
confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings
highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents
in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing
trustworthy computer-use agents. Our benchmark is publicly available at

*Yongjin Yang, Sinjae Kang, Juyong Lee, Dongjun Lee, Se-Young Yun, Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EXIF is a framework for LLM-powered agents to automatically discover feasible skills and improve performance through an exploration-first strategy and iterative feedback loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in creating training datasets for LLM agents, such as manual effort and invalid task proposals, drive the need for an automated skill discovery method.

Method: EXIF uses an exploration agent (Alice) to generate feasible skills and train the target agent (Bob), with an iterative feedback loop to refine learning.

Result: Experiments show EXIF effectively discovers skills and improves agent performance without human intervention, even when Alice and Bob are the same model.

Conclusion: EXIF enables self-evolving LLM agents by automating skill discovery and iterative improvement, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth in ML manuscript submissions is straining peer review, leading to concerns about quality and reviewer fatigue.

Method: Proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) as collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs, focusing on factual verification, reviewer guidance, and decision support.

Result: Outlines a research agenda for developing AI-assisted review systems, emphasizing the need for structured and ethical review data.

Conclusion: Calls for proactive development of AI-assisted peer review to maintain scientific integrity and scalability.

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer
review.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POCCO is a plug-and-play framework for MOCOPs that adaptively selects model structures for subproblems and optimizes them using preference signals, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all subproblems equally with a single model, limiting solution space exploration and performance.

Method: POCCO uses a conditional computation block to route subproblems to specialized architectures and a preference-driven optimization algorithm for learning pairwise preferences.

Result: POCCO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four MOCOP benchmarks, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: POCCO's adaptive and preference-driven approach enhances performance and versatility in solving MOCOPs.

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are resource-intensive; SRLMs provide a cost-effective alternative but need performance improvements for complex tasks.

Method: Investigates supervised fine-tuning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), reinforcement learning (RL), and hybrid methods to enhance 0.5B SRLMs.

Result: Identifies effective methodologies to bridge the performance gap between SRLMs and larger models.

Conclusion: Provides actionable recommendations for optimizing 0.5B SRLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of language models has led to the development of
large-scale architectures that demonstrate exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, these models come with significant computational
and energy demands, as well as potential privacy implications. In this context,
Small Reasoning Language Models (SRLMs) with approximately 0.5 billion
parameters present a compelling alternative due to their remarkable
computational efficiency and cost effectiveness, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Despite these advantages, the limited
capacity of 0.5 billion parameter models poses challenges in handling complex
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This research
investigates various training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and reinforcement learning (RL), as well as
their hybrid implementations, to enhance the performance of 0.5B SRLMs. We
analyze effective methodologies to bridge the performance gap between SRLMS and
larger models and present insights into optimal training pipelines tailored for
these smaller architectures. Through extensive experimental validation and
analysis, our work aims to provide actionable recommendations for maximizing
the reasoning capabilities of 0.5B models.

*Siyi Xie, Hanxin Zhu, Tianyu He, Xin Li, Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Sonic4D introduces a framework for generating spatial audio aligned with 4D scenes, enhancing immersive audiovisual experiences by localizing sound sources and synthesizing spatial audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D generation methods focus on visual realism but neglect spatial audio, limiting immersive experiences. Sonic4D addresses this gap.

Method: The framework involves three stages: 1) generating 4D scenes and monaural audio, 2) localizing sound sources via visual grounding, and 3) synthesizing spatial audio using physics-based simulation.

Result: The method produces realistic spatial audio aligned with 4D scenes, improving immersion without requiring training.

Conclusion: Sonic4D successfully integrates spatial audio with 4D scenes, advancing immersive audiovisual experiences.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 4D generation have demonstrated its remarkable
capability in synthesizing photorealistic renderings of dynamic 3D scenes.
However, despite achieving impressive visual performance, almost all existing
methods overlook the generation of spatial audio aligned with the corresponding
4D scenes, posing a significant limitation to truly immersive audiovisual
experiences. To mitigate this issue, we propose Sonic4D, a novel framework that
enables spatial audio generation for immersive exploration of 4D scenes.
Specifically, our method is composed of three stages: 1) To capture both the
dynamic visual content and raw auditory information from a monocular video, we
first employ pre-trained expert models to generate the 4D scene and its
corresponding monaural audio. 2) Subsequently, to transform the monaural audio
into spatial audio, we localize and track the sound sources within the 4D
scene, where their 3D spatial coordinates at different timestamps are estimated
via a pixel-level visual grounding strategy. 3) Based on the estimated sound
source locations, we further synthesize plausible spatial audio that varies
across different viewpoints and timestamps using physics-based simulation.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method generates
realistic spatial audio consistent with the synthesized 4D scene in a
training-free manner, significantly enhancing the immersive experience for
users. Generated audio and video examples are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore advanced pooling methods for SER, as they remain underexplored despite their potential impact on performance.

Method: Systematically benchmarked pooling strategies, focusing on Multi-Query Multi-Head Attentive Statistics Pooling, and analyzed attention patterns.

Result: Achieved a 3.5% macro F1 gain over average pooling, with 15% of frames capturing 80% of emotion cues. Non-linguistic vocalizations and hyperarticulated phonemes were prioritized.

Conclusion: Attentive pooling is a high-performing and biologically plausible method for SER, offering explainable emotion localization.

Abstract: State-of-the-art transformer models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) rely
on temporal feature aggregation, yet advanced pooling methods remain
underexplored. We systematically benchmark pooling strategies, including
Multi-Query Multi-Head Attentive Statistics Pooling, which achieves a 3.5
percentage point macro F1 gain over average pooling. Attention analysis shows
15 percent of frames capture 80 percent of emotion cues, revealing a localized
pattern of emotional information. Analysis of high-attention frames reveals
that non-linguistic vocalizations and hyperarticulated phonemes are
disproportionately prioritized during pooling, mirroring human perceptual
strategies. Our findings position attentive pooling as both a performant SER
mechanism and a biologically plausible tool for explainable emotion
localization. On Interspeech 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic
Conditions Challenge, our approach obtained a macro F1 score of 0.3649.

Motivation: To leverage spatial cues from images for generating stereo singing voices with room reverberation, combining visual and acoustic matching.

Method: VS-Singer uses a modal interaction network for spatial-enriched text encoding, a decoder with a consistency Schr√∂dinger bridge for one-step generation, and an SFE module for audio-visual matching.

Result: VS-Singer effectively generates stereo singing voices aligned with scene perspective in one step.

Conclusion: This is the first unified framework for stereo singing voice synthesis with visual acoustic matching, demonstrating successful integration of spatial cues.

Abstract: To explore the potential advantages of utilizing spatial cues from images for
generating stereo singing voices with room reverberation, we introduce
VS-Singer, a vision-guided model designed to produce stereo singing voices with
room reverberation from scene images. VS-Singer comprises three modules:
firstly, a modal interaction network integrates spatial features into text
encoding to create a linguistic representation enriched with spatial
information. Secondly, the decoder employs a consistency Schr\"odinger bridge
to facilitate one-step sample generation. Moreover, we utilize the SFE module
to improve the consistency of audio-visual matching. To our knowledge, this
study is the first to combine stereo singing voice synthesis with visual
acoustic matching within a unified framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that VS-Singer can effectively generate stereo singing voices that align with
the scene perspective in a single step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dysarthria severely impairs speech intelligibility, creating a need for effective conversion techniques to improve communication for affected individuals.

Method: The study investigates SSL features and WavLM-extracted features, proposing a non-autoregressive approach using CFM with Diffusion Transformers for direct dysarthric-to-clean speech mapping.

Result: Discrete acoustic units improve intelligibility and achieve faster convergence than mel-spectrogram-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the potential of SSL features and quantized representations for efficient and effective dysarthric speech conversion.

Abstract: Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech
intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate
effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular
speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and
limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized
representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation.
Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating
clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To
this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages
Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct
mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while
achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods require post-processing and lack interpretability, while large-scale audio models' potential in fault diagnosis is unexplored.

Method: AeroGPT uses Vibration Signal Alignment (VSA) to adapt general audio knowledge to vibration patterns and Generative Fault Classification (GFC) for direct fault label output.

Result: Achieved 98.94% accuracy on DIRG dataset and 100% on HIT dataset, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: AeroGPT enhances interpretability and industrial applicability, demonstrating the potential of large-scale models in fault diagnosis.

Abstract: Aerospace engines, as critical components in aviation and aerospace
industries, require continuous and accurate fault diagnosis to ensure
operational safety and prevent catastrophic failures. While deep learning
techniques have been extensively studied in this context, they output logits or
confidence scores, necessitating post-processing to derive actionable insights.
Furthermore, the potential of large-scale audio models in this domain remains
largely untapped. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AeroGPT, a
novel framework that transfers knowledge from general audio domain to
aero-engine bearing fault diagnosis. AeroGPT is a framework based on
large-scale audio model that incorporates Vibration Signal Alignment (VSA) to
adapt general audio knowledge to domain-specific vibration patterns, and
combines Generative Fault Classification (GFC) to directly output interpretable
fault labels. This approach eliminates the need for post-processing of fault
labels, supports interactive, interpretable, and actionable fault diagnosis,
thereby greatly enhancing industrial applicability. Through comprehensive
experimental validation on two aero-engine bearing datasets, AeroGPT achieved
exceptional performance with 98.94% accuracy on the DIRG dataset and perfect
100% classification on the HIT bearing dataset, surpassing traditional deep
learning approaches. Additional Qualitative analysis validates the
effectiveness of our approach and highlights the potential of large-scale

TL;DR: VRVQ improves speech coding by dynamically adjusting bitrate per frame, optimizing rate-distortion trade-offs and enhancing noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard codecs waste bitrate on noise components, degrading compression efficiency in noisy speech.

Method: Introduces Variable Bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) with dynamic bitrate adjustment and a feature denoiser.

Result: VRVQ outperforms conventional methods in rate-distortion trade-offs and perceptual quality under noise.

Conclusion: VRVQ is a noise-robust solution for high-fidelity speech coding, improving efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) has become a dominant approach in neural
speech and audio coding, providing high-fidelity compression. However, speech
coding presents additional challenges due to real-world noise, which degrades
compression efficiency. Standard codecs allocate bits uniformly, wasting
bitrate on noise components that do not contribute to intelligibility. This
paper introduces a Variable Bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) framework for noise-robust
speech coding, dynamically adjusting bitrate per frame to optimize
rate-distortion trade-offs. Unlike constant bitrate (CBR) RVQ, our method
prioritizes critical speech components while suppressing residual noise.
Additionally, we integrate a feature denoiser to further improve noise
robustness. Experimental results show that VRVQ improves rate-distortion
trade-offs over conventional methods, achieving better compression efficiency
and perceptual quality in noisy conditions. Samples are available at our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating acoustic transfer function (ATF) magnitude is valuable for spatial audio applications where phase measurements are unreliable or unavailable.

Method: Proposes a neural network with input/output layers conditioned on source/receiver positions and frequency, plus an aggregation module for latent variables, resembling an autoencoder-based sound field expansion.

Result: Numerical simulations show accurate ATF magnitude estimation with few receivers.

Conclusion: The method effectively estimates ATF magnitude from sparse measurements, enhancing spatial audio applications.

Abstract: A learning-based method for estimating the magnitude distribution of sound
fields from spatially sparse measurements is proposed. Estimating the magnitude
distribution of acoustic transfer function (ATF) is useful when phase
measurements are unreliable or inaccessible and has a wide range of
applications related to spatial audio. We propose a neural-network-based method
for the ATF magnitude estimation. The key feature of our network architecture
is the input and output layers conditioned on source and receiver positions and
frequency and the aggregation module of latent variables, which can be
interpreted as an autoencoder-based extension of the basis expansion of the
sound field. Numerical simulation results indicated that the ATF magnitude is
accurately estimated with a small number of receivers by our proposed method.

TL;DR: HybridSep, a two-stage LASS framework, integrates SSL-based acoustic representations and CLAP-derived semantic embeddings with Adversarial Consistent Training (ACT) to improve audio separation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LASS methods struggle with aligning auditory features and linguistic context while maintaining precision. The potential of SSL and CLAP frameworks is underexplored.

Method: HybridSep combines SSL-based acoustic features and CLAP semantic embeddings, using ACT for optimization. ACT integrates adversarial training and diffusion as regularization.

Result: HybridSep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., AudioSep, FlowSep) across multiple metrics, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybridSep demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating SSL and CLAP with ACT, advancing LASS performance.

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Separation (LASS) employs linguistic queries to
isolate target sounds based on semantic descriptions. However, existing methods
face challenges in aligning complex auditory features with linguistic context
while preserving separation precision. Current research efforts focus primarily
on text description augmentation and architectural innovations, yet the
potential of integrating pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) audio
models and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) frameworks, capable of
extracting cross-modal audio-text relationships, remains underexplored. To
address this, we present HybridSep, a two-stage LASS framework that synergizes
SSL-based acoustic representations with CLAP-derived semantic embeddings. Our
framework introduces Adversarial Consistent Training (ACT), a novel
optimization strategy that treats diffusion as an auxiliary regularization loss
while integrating adversarial training to enhance separation fidelity.
Experiments demonstrate that HybridSep achieves significant performance
improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., AudioSep, FlowSep) across
multiple metrics, establishing new benchmarks for LASS tasks.

Result: ITO improves mastering performance across styles, validated through objective evaluation, subjective tests, and CLAP embeddings. It enhances style similarity and adaptability.

Conclusion: ITO-Master offers an effective, user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, enabling refinement beyond initial style application.

Abstract: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering
characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the
professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed
processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the
results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the
ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that
integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over
the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference,
our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level
adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both
black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and
demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles.
Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative
analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that
ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability.
Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for
mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the

Result: Larger models generally perform better on non-Western music, though performance declines for culturally distant traditions. State-of-the-art results achieved on five of six datasets.

Conclusion: Foundation models encode substantial musical knowledge, but targeted fine-tuning doesn't always outperform probing. The framework aids in benchmarking future progress toward universal music representations.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but
questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical
traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning
Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ
three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural
capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised
fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource
scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with
larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results
decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music
understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not
consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation
models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework
and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are
from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for
future progress.

### [412] [TAPS: Throat and Acoustic Paired Speech Dataset for Deep Learning-Based Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11478)
*Yunsik Kim, Yonghun Song, Yoonyoung Chung*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the TAPS dataset for enhancing throat microphone recordings in noisy environments and evaluates deep learning models for speech improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clear speech capture in noisy settings is difficult; throat microphones help but lose high-frequency clarity. Lack of a standard dataset limits progress.

Method: Developed the TAPS dataset with paired throat and acoustic recordings from 60 speakers, and an alignment method for signal mismatch. Tested three deep learning models.

Result: Mapping-based models outperformed others in improving speech quality and content restoration.

Conclusion: The TAPS dataset is valuable for speech enhancement and can serve as a standard for throat microphone research.

Abstract: In high-noise environments such as factories, subways, and busy streets,
capturing clear speech is challenging. Throat microphones can offer a solution
because of their inherent noise-suppression capabilities; however, the passage
of sound waves through skin and tissue attenuates high-frequency information,
reducing speech clarity. Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in
enhancing throat microphone recordings, but further progress is constrained by
the lack of a standard dataset. Here, we introduce the Throat and Acoustic
Paired Speech (TAPS) dataset, a collection of paired utterances recorded from
60 native Korean speakers using throat and acoustic microphones. Furthermore,
an optimal alignment approach was developed and applied to address the inherent
signal mismatch between the two microphones. We tested three baseline deep
learning models on the TAPS dataset and found mapping-based approaches to be
superior for improving speech quality and restoring content. These findings
demonstrate the TAPS dataset's utility for speech enhancement tasks and support
its potential as a standard resource for advancing research in throat
microphone-based applications.

### [413] [Streaming Endpointer for Spoken Dialogue using Neural Audio Codecs and Label-Delayed Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07081)
*Sathvik Udupa, Shinji Watanabe, Petr Schwarz, Jan Cernocky*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time speech endpointing method for multi-turn dialogues using Neural Audio Codec (NAC) features and a label delay training scheme, achieving significant error reductions and faster response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional endpointers rely on spectrum-based audio features, which may not be optimal for real-time, multi-turn dialogues. The study aims to improve accuracy and reduce latency using NAC features.

Method: The approach combines streaming, low-bitrate NAC features with a novel label delay training scheme to minimize cutoff errors.

Result: At 160 ms median latency, the method reduces cutoff errors by 42.7% (single-stream) and 37.5% (two-stream) compared to baselines. Integration with a speech LLM improves response time by 1200 ms and reduces errors by 35%.

Conclusion: The proposed NAC and label delay approach significantly enhances endpointing accuracy and efficiency, particularly for real-time dialogue systems.

Abstract: Accurate, low-latency endpointing is crucial for effective spoken dialogue
systems. While traditional endpointers often rely on spectrum-based audio
features, this work proposes real-time speech endpointing for multi-turn
dialogues using streaming, low-bitrate Neural Audio Codec (NAC) features,
building upon recent advancements in neural audio codecs. To further reduce
cutoff errors, we introduce a novel label delay training scheme. At a fixed
median latency of 160 ms, our combined NAC and label delay approach achieves
significant relative cutoff error reductions: 42.7% for a single-stream
endpointer and 37.5% for a two-stream configuration, compared to baseline
methods. Finally, we demonstrate efficient integration with a codec-based
pretrained speech large language model, improving its median response time by
1200 ms and reducing its cutoff error by 35%.

*Aditya Bhattacharjee, Ivan Meresman Higgs, Mark Sandler, Emmanouil Benetos*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A lightweight Graph Neural Network model for ASID achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art with fewer parameters, using a two-stage retrieval approach and benchmarking short queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASID struggles with identifying samples modified by musical transformations, unlike audio fingerprinting, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Proposes a Graph Neural Network in a contrastive learning framework, with a two-stage retrieval system (coarse search + cross-attention classifier).

Result: Achieves 44.2% mAP with only 9% of the parameters of the current best system.

Conclusion: The model is scalable, efficient, and addresses key ASID challenges, with published annotations for short queries.

Abstract: Automatic sample identification (ASID), the detection and identification of
portions of audio recordings that have been reused in new musical works, is an
essential but challenging task in the field of audio query-based retrieval.
While a related task, audio fingerprinting, has made significant progress in
accurately retrieving musical content under "real world" (noisy, reverberant)
conditions, ASID systems struggle to identify samples that have undergone
musical modifications. Thus, a system robust to common music production
transformations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, effects processing,
and underlying or overlaying music is an important open challenge.
  In this work, we propose a lightweight and scalable encoding architecture
employing a Graph Neural Network within a contrastive learning framework. Our
model uses only 9% of the trainable parameters compared to the current
state-of-the-art system while achieving comparable performance, reaching a mean
average precision (mAP) of 44.2%.
  To enhance retrieval quality, we introduce a two-stage approach consisting of
an initial coarse similarity search for candidate selection, followed by a
cross-attention classifier that rejects irrelevant matches and refines the
ranking of retrieved candidates - an essential capability absent in prior
models. In addition, because queries in real-world applications are often short
in duration, we benchmark our system for short queries using new fine-grained
annotations for the Sample100 dataset, which we publish as part of this work.

*Wang Yu-Hang, Liu ying, Fang liang, Wang Xuelin, Junkang Guo, Shiwei Li, Lei Gao, Jian Liu, Wenfei Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AET (Adversarial Evolution Training) improves adversarial robustness by adding an initial ERM phase to AT, achieving faster training, better clean accuracy, and lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AT variants focus on attack generation but neglect foundational feature representations, limiting robustness efficiency.

Method: AET prepends an ERM phase to AT to cultivate a favorable feature manifold, enhancing robustness acquisition.

Result: AET achieves comparable/superior robustness faster, improves clean accuracy, and reduces training costs by 8-25%.

Conclusion: Feature pre-conditioning via ERM is key for efficient and principled robust defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants
overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger
attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple
yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM
phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and
effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or
superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training
costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets,
architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings
underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for
developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the
supplementary material.

*Jiahe Qin, Junpeng Li, Changchun Hua, Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MDPU, a generalized learning framework for Label Proportion Learning (LLP), addressing challenges in obtaining precise class proportions. It includes unbiased risk estimation, risk correction, and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical applications struggle with obtaining precise class proportion information, and existing methods may not fully leverage proportional constraints within tuples.

Method: MDPU models instance distribution under constraints, derives an unbiased risk estimator, and introduces risk correction to prevent overfitting.

Result: The framework shows consistency in theory and outperforms baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: MDPU effectively addresses LLP challenges, offering a robust and practical solution.

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where
multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information
about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications,
obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances
in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application
scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances
within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework
\emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of
instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number
of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we
derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable
overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced,
leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization
error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the
consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

*Yajie Ji, Yanlai Chen, Shawn Koohy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S$^2$GPT-PINN is a compact, efficient model for solving parametric PDEs, using minimal parameters and computational power via knowledge distillation and down-sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for domain-specific, efficient solutions for parametric PDEs without the computational overhead of large models.

Method: Leverages high-quality data and a greedy algorithm, uses knowledge distillation from Pre-Trained PINNs, and employs down-sampling for physics-informed loss calculation.

Result: Achieves high efficiency with significantly fewer parameters than traditional PINNs.

Conclusion: S$^2$GPT-PINN offers a scalable, efficient approach for solving parametric PDEs with minimal computational resources.

Abstract: We propose S$^2$GPT-PINN, a sparse and small model for solving parametric
partial differential equations (PDEs). Similar to Small Language Models (SLMs),
S$^2$GPT-PINN is tailored to domain-specific (families of) PDEs and
characterized by its compact architecture and minimal computational power.
Leveraging a small amount of extremely high quality data via a mathematically
rigorous greedy algorithm that is enabled by the large full-order models,
S$^2$GPT-PINN relies on orders of magnitude less parameters than PINNs to
achieve extremely high efficiency via two levels of customizations. The first
is knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions that are
transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs. The second is a judicious down-sampling
when calculating the physics-informed loss of the network compressing the
number of data sites by orders of magnitude to the size of the small model.

*Hui Ma, Kai Yang, Man-On Pun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end framework for cellular traffic prediction using CNNs with attention and Kalman filters, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cellular traffic is dynamic and affected by exogenous factors, degrading prediction accuracy.

Method: Uses CNNs with attention for spatial dynamics and Kalman filters for temporal modeling, incorporating auxiliary data like social activities.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in accuracy on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns and improves prediction performance.

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage
network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced
by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic
prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two
variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular
traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an
attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for
temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information
such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our
proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in
terms of prediction accuracy.

### [419] [The Hidden Cost of an Image: Quantifying the Energy Consumption of AI Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17016)
*Giulia Bertazzini, Chiara Albisani, Daniele Baracchi, Dasara Shullani, Roberto Verdecchia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the environmental impact of AI image generation by comparing energy consumption across 17 models, analyzing factors like resolution, quantization, and prompt length, and assessing trade-offs with image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to quantify the hidden environmental costs of AI image generation, addressing concerns about the growing resource demands of AI technologies.

Method: A comprehensive empirical experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models, evaluating energy consumption based on factors like model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length, alongside image quality metrics.

Result: Energy consumption varies significantly (up to 46x) among models. Resolution inconsistently affects energy (1.3x‚Äì4.7x increase when doubled). U-Net models are more efficient than Transformer-based ones. Quantization reduces efficiency, while prompt length has no significant impact. High-quality images don't always require more energy.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for energy-efficient AI image generation, as some high-quality models are also energy-efficient, and factors like resolution and model architecture significantly impact environmental costs.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the
ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer
a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each
image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical
experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation.
Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by
considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such
as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we
consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs
between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image
generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up
to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption
inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution.
U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model
quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most
models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant
impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher
energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality
images also being among the most energy efficient ones.

### [420] [BASE-Q: Bias and Asymmetric Scaling Enhanced Rotational Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15689)
*Liulu He, Shenli Zhen, Karwei Sun, Yijiang Liu, Yufei Zhao, Chongkang Tan, Huanrui Yang, Yuan Du, Li Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASE-Q, a method combining bias correction and asymmetric scaling to reduce errors in rotational quantization for LLMs, enabling blockwise optimization and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rotational quantization methods for LLMs have limitations: they fail to align channel means, increasing rounding errors, and make activation distributions more Gaussian-like, causing clipping errors.

Method: BASE-Q combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to address rounding and clipping errors, and enables blockwise optimization to reduce memory overhead.

Result: BASE-Q reduces the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5%, 42.9%, and 29.2% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively.

Conclusion: BASE-Q is a simple yet effective solution for improving rotational quantization in LLMs, offering significant performance gains and practical utility.

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

*Zifei Xu, Sayeh Sharify, Hesham Mostafa, Tristan Webb, Wanzin Yazar, Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores accelerating neural speech transcription by sparsifying time-domain signals early in transformer encoders, achieving up to 1.6x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech signals are highly compressible, and leveraging transformer self-attention interpretability can optimize neural encoding efficiency.

Method: A systematic search over sparsification stages and compression ratios in Whisper models, targeting early encoder layers.

Result: Optimal solutions sparsify hidden states to 40-60% at early stages, yielding 1.6x speedup with <1% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Early-stage sparsification in transformer encoders effectively accelerates speech transcription without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM Web Dynamics (LWD) to study model collapse in LLMs at the network level, using a RAG database for simulation and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient exploration of model collapse in LLMs, especially at the network level, beyond single-model or statistical surrogate studies.

Method: Develops LWD, a framework simulating the Internet with a RAG database to analyze model output convergence, supported by theoretical analogies to Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: The framework provides insights into model collapse patterns and offers theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Conclusion: LWD effectively explores model collapse in LLMs at the network level, bridging gaps in existing research.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced
data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the
potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing
studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely
solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics
(LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network
level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to
interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes whether latent action models (LAMs) capture action-relevant changes or noise in unlabeled videos, using a tractable linear model to derive insights and validate strategies like data augmentation and cleaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether LAMs learn controllable changes or irrelevant noise from unlabeled videos, given the challenge of distinguishing between the two.

Method: A tractable linear model is used to analytically study LAM learning, connecting it to PCA and evaluating strategies like data augmentation, cleaning, and auxiliary action-prediction.

Result: Insights include connections to PCA, policy desiderata, and validation of strategies to enhance learning of controllable changes, supported by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the conditions under which LAMs learn action-relevant changes and proposes practical strategies to improve their performance.

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from
unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However,
differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well
as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the
changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue
analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM
learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including
connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of
the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage
learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and
auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on
numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations,
actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-STAR is a novel approach for building LLM-based MLE agents that leverages external knowledge and iterative refinement to outperform existing methods in Kaggle competitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based MLE agents rely too much on inherent LLM knowledge and coarse exploration, limiting their ability to select task-specific models and deeply explore components like feature engineering.

Method: MLE-STAR uses a search engine to retrieve effective models, forms an initial solution, and iteratively refines it by exploring specific ML components, guided by ablation studies. It also introduces a novel ensembling method.

Result: MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of Kaggle competitions on MLE-bench, significantly outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: MLE-STAR demonstrates superior performance by combining external knowledge retrieval, targeted exploration, and novel ensembling.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering
(MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However,
existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM
knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code
structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific
models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as
experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these,
we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first
leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective
models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it
by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This
exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual
code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an
effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that
MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench,
significantly outperforming the best alternative.

TL;DR: A verifiable model-free safety filter using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability is introduced, addressing the lack of formal guarantees in learning-based safety filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based safety filters outperform conventional methods but lack formal safety guarantees, prompting the need for verifiable solutions.

Method: Extends verifiable self-consistency for Q value functions, introduces a multiplicative Q-network to prevent shrinkage, and develops a verification pipeline.

Result: Successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety certificates in four safe-control benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides formally verified safety guarantees, advancing the reliability of learning-based safety filters.

Abstract: Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods,
such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting
to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal
safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety
filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary
contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for
Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to
mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification
pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our
proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety
certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

*Pranav Pawar, Akshansh Dwivedi, Jenish Boricha, Himanshu Gohil, Aditya Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new TTS architecture improves multilingual accent accuracy and emotion synthesis for Hindi and Indian English, outperforming existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS systems struggle with multilingual accents and context-relevant emotions due to cultural nuances, especially for Indic languages.

Method: Extends Parler-TTS with a hybrid encoder-decoder, culture-sensitive emotion layers, and dynamic accent code switching.

Result: 23.7% accent accuracy improvement, 85.3% emotion recognition, and 4.2/5 MOS for cultural correctness.

Conclusion: The system advances cross-lingual synthesis with scalable accent-emotion disentanglement, useful for EdTech and accessibility.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in
monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents
(especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses
difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This
paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with
preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly
tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS
model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid
encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers
trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent
code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests
demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction
from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native
listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system
is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste,
let's talk about <Hindi phrase>" with uninterrupted accent shifts while
preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported
a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than
existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual
synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement,
with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

TL;DR: A framework combining kernel PCA, MLP, and MIGA for disease prediction achieves high accuracy (up to 100%) and reduces tuning time by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disease prediction accuracy and reduce computational costs in hyperparameter optimization.

Method: Uses kernel PCA for dimensionality reduction, MLP for classification, and MIGA for parallel hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Achieved 99.12% (breast cancer), 94.87% (Parkinson's), and 100% (CKD) accuracy, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for disease prediction, with MIGA significantly reducing tuning time and improving accuracy.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework that integrates nonlinear feature
extraction, classification, and efficient optimization. First, kernel principal
component analysis with a radial basis function kernel reduces dimensionality
while preserving 95% of the variance. Second, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
learns to predict disease status. Finally, a modified multiprocessing genetic
algorithm (MIGA) optimizes MLP hyperparameters in parallel over ten
generations. We evaluated this approach on three datasets: the Wisconsin
Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, and
the chronic kidney disease dataset. The MLP tuned by the MIGA achieved the best
accuracy of 99.12% for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson's disease, and 100%
for chronic kidney disease. These results outperform those of other methods,
such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Compared with a
standard genetic algorithm, kernel PCA revealed nonlinear relationships that
improved classification, and the MIGA's parallel fitness evaluations reduced
the tuning time by approximately 60%. The genetic algorithm incurs high
computational cost from sequential fitness evaluations, but our multiprocessing
interface GA (MIGA) parallelizes this step, slashing the tuning time and
steering the MLP toward the best accuracy score of 99.12%, 94.87%, and 100% for
breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and CKD, respectively.

*Xinxing Ren, Qianbo Zang, Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimuGen is a multimodal framework to generate accurate Simulink simulation code by combining visual diagrams and domain knowledge, addressing LLMs' limitations in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with Simulink model generation due to lack of domain-specific pretraining data, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: SimuGen uses a collaborative agent-based framework with roles like investigator, code generator, and debug locator, supported by a knowledge base.

Result: The framework produces interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulations.

Conclusion: SimuGen effectively bridges the gap in LLM capabilities for Simulink code generation, offering a modular and domain-aware solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still
struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models,
which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our
preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable
and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the
lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge,
we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically
generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual
Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized
agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator,
executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific
knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable,
robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is
publicly available at https://github.com/renxinxing123/SimuGen_beta.

### [429] [CoC: Chain-of-Cancer based on Cross-Modal Autoregressive Traction for Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15696)
*Haipeng Zhou, Sicheng Yang, Sihan Yang, Jing Qin, Lei Chen, Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, Chain-of-Cancer (CoC), combining four modalities (three clinical and language) for cancer survival prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on pathology and genomics, ignoring epigenetic data and textual descriptions. The study aims to integrate these for better prediction.

Method: Proposes CoC framework with intra-learning (domain-specific clinical data) and inter-learning (language prompting and Autoregressive Mutual Traction for synergy).

Result: Evaluated on five cancer datasets, the method outperforms existing approaches, producing state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The CoC framework effectively integrates multiple modalities for survival prediction, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients.
Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either
individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis,
epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this
task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to
guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four
modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting
survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and
inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain
domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we
use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual
Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework
facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated
across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing \sota
results. Codes will be released.

*Yunhak Oh, Junseok Lee, Yeongmin Kim, Sangwoo Seo, Namkyeong Lee, Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spotscape is a new framework for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) that improves spatial domain identification by capturing global relationships and regulating spot distances, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods for SRT struggle with meaningful spot representations, especially near domain boundaries, due to overemphasis on adjacent spots with minimal feature differences.

Method: Spotscape introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global spot relationships and a similarity scaling strategy for intra- and inter-slice spot distance regulation.

Result: Spotscape excels in single-slice and multi-slice downstream tasks, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: Spotscape addresses limitations of current SRT methods, offering enhanced spatial domain analysis and multi-slice integration.

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

*Shengyuan Hu, Neil Kale, Pratiksha Thaker, Yiwei Fu, Steven Wu, Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	exttt{BLUR}$, a benchmark for LLM unlearning, addressing flaws in current benchmarks by providing realistic forget-retain overlap scenarios. It shows existing methods perform poorly on $	exttt{BLUR}$, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning benchmarks are flawed, giving a misleading picture of effectiveness. This can lead to vulnerabilities like relearning attacks, necessitating a more realistic benchmark.

Method: The authors develop $	exttt{BLUR}$, a benchmark with extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying difficulty.

Result: Existing unlearning methods perform significantly worse on $	exttt{BLUR}$, with simpler approaches outperforming recent ones.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of robust evaluation in LLM unlearning and suggests future research directions. $	exttt{BLUR}$ is publicly available for use.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language
models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key
challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively
unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good
performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM
unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --
painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This
can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign
perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly
unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present
$\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic
scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on
existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined
forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of
difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that
the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on
$\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more
recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and
suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/forgelab/BLUR

### [432] [Contraction Actor-Critic: Contraction Metric-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Robust Path Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15700)
*Minjae Cho, Hiroyasu Tsukamoto, Huy Trong Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance optimality and scalability in control policies, proposing the Contraction Actor-Critic (CAC) algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCMs alone lack optimality guarantees and require known dynamics, limiting scalability. Integrating CCMs with RL addresses these issues by leveraging RL's long-term optimality and adaptability to unknown dynamics.

Method: The CAC algorithm learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) and uses actor-critic RL to optimize tracking policies guided by the metric, combining CCMs' stability with RL's adaptability.

Result: CAC outperforms baselines in simulated and real-world robot experiments, demonstrating improved control performance and scalability.

Conclusion: Integrating CCMs with RL via CAC enhances control policy stability and optimality, offering a scalable solution for complex systems with uncertain dynamics.

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a
controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite
Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be
incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only
ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single
trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an
entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics
model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex
feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring
high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to
integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide
dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize
cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,
called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs
to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in
a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC
simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a
contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal
tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical
studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a
theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

*Haolin Pan, Hongyu Lin, Haoran Luo, Yang Liu, Kaichun Yao, Libo Zhang, Mingjie Xing, Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compiler-R1 is an RL-driven framework enhancing LLMs for compiler auto-tuning, featuring a high-quality dataset and two-stage RL training, achieving 8.46% IR instruction reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of high-quality reasoning datasets and limited interactions in compiler tuning using LLMs.

Method: Introduces Compiler-R1 with a curated dataset and two-stage RL training pipeline for efficient exploration and learning.

Result: Achieves an average 8.46% reduction in IR instruction count compared to opt -Oz across seven datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning optimizes pass sequences to improve performance metrics
such as Intermediate Representation (IR) instruction count. Although recent
advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the
absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited
effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we
introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework
specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1
features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage
end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and
learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven
datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction
count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of
RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/Compiler-R1.

*Peter Belcak, Greg Heinrich, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Minifinetuning (MFT) reduces overfitting-induced performance loss in low-data domain adaptation without pre-training data, outperforming standard finetuning and parameter-efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the deterioration of general performance in language models when finetuned for new domains, especially with limited data.

Method: MFT uses corrective self-distillation at the sample level to mitigate overfitting and degeneralization, requiring as little as 500 samples.

Result: MFT shows 2-10x better specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning and is robust to overfitting in low-data settings.

Conclusion: MFT effectively balances domain adaptation and general performance, offering a scalable solution for low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the
deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the
more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain
adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced
degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any
pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable
specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a
wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to
overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500
samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample
level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates
replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with
either for a combined effect.

*Guoqing Chao, Zhenghao Zhang, Lei Meng, Jie Wen, Dianhui Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIMCFG is a federated incomplete multi-view clustering method that uses globally fused graph guidance to improve feature extraction and clustering, addressing missing data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated multi-view clustering methods lack global feature exploitation and overlook missing data problems.

Method: Dual-head graph convolutional encoder extracts global and view-specific features, fused under a global graph for clustering with pseudo-labeling.

Result: FIMCFG outperforms existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: FIMCFG successfully addresses missing data and global feature integration in federated multi-view clustering.

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable
information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has
achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great
progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global
pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit
the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data
problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address
these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a
dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of
underlying features containing global and view-specific information.
Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying
features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is
conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level
features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and
pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

### [436] [Learn from the Past: Fast Sparse Indexing for Large Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15704)
*Feiyu Yao, Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS accelerates sparse indexing in LLMs by leveraging historical attention patterns, achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing memory demand for KV caches in LLMs with long contexts creates bottlenecks in GPU memory and bandwidth. Existing sparse attention methods inefficiently retrieve indices due to independent step processing.

Method: LFPS dynamically constructs sparse indexing candidates using historical attention patterns (vertical and slash) and a positional expansion strategy to predict Top-k indices.

Result: LFPS achieves up to 22.8√ó speedup over full attention and 9.6√ó over exact Top-k retrieval on benchmarks, preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: LFPS provides an efficient and practical solution for optimizing long-context LLM decoding.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

*Jittarin Jetwiriyanon, Teo Susnjak, Surangika Ranathunga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs show strong zero-shot forecasting for macroeconomic indicators, matching classical models in stable conditions but struggling during rapid shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the zero-shot forecasting capabilities of TSFMs for macroeconomic indicators without extensive training data.

Method: Applied three TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT, Moirai) to univariate forecasting of economic indicators, tested under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks.

Result: TSFMs internalize economic dynamics, handle regime shifts, and provide uncertainty estimates, matching multivariate models in stable conditions but degrading during shocks.

Conclusion: TSFMs are viable for zero-shot macroeconomic forecasting in stable conditions but require caution during rapid shocks.

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series
Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to
forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need
for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our
experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional
customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos,
TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our
results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich
economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved
uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art
multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any
fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic
conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during
periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when
zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic
planning.

### [438] [MDPO: Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15706)
*Yunze Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning by addressing DPO's limitations in long-chain reasoning, achieving better performance on GSM8K and MATH datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DPO fail to effectively suppress incorrect outputs in long-chain mathematical reasoning due to their inability to capture granular differences in preferences.

Method: Proposes MDPO, optimizing LLMs at three granularities (Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, Step2Step) and unifying training objectives with generation metrics.

Result: MDPO improves Qwen2 and Llama3 by 1.7%/0.9% on GSM8K and 2.3%/1.2% on MATH, outperforming DPO and variants.

Conclusion: MDPO enhances mathematical reasoning in LLMs by addressing DPO's shortcomings and offers a cost-effective data construction pipeline.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step.
Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of
LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress
incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using
preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it
has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because
DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and
rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between
DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of
suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct
Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of
LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and
Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain
reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps;
Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational
capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the
three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted
experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements
of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset,
outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a
pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not
require manual annotation costs.

*Xinglin Wang, Yiwei Li, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Yueqi Zhang, Jiayi Shi, Chuyi Tan, Boyuan Pan, Yao Hu, Kan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DORA optimizes test-time search in LLMs by allocating resources at the direction level, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search methods inefficiently allocate compute due to favoring reasoning directions with more candidates.

Method: Formulates test-time search as a resource allocation problem and introduces DORA, a direction-level allocation strategy.

Result: DORA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025 benchmarks.

Conclusion: DORA provides a provably optimal solution for efficient test-time scaling in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple
reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most
effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient
use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search
as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy
that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed
rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of
existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning
directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and
inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented
Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias
by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources
at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct
extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks
including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA
consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a
broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

*Falih Gozi Febrinanto, Adonia Simango, Chengpei Xu, Jingjing Zhou, Jiangang Ma, Sonika Tyagi, Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGB, a novel GNN framework, improves brain disease classification by modeling causal relationships between brain ROIs using transfer entropy and geometric curvature, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs for brain disease detection often overlook causal relationships between ROIs, which are crucial for understanding signal interactions.

Method: CGB combines causal discovery (transfer entropy) and geometric curvature to refine brain networks, enhancing GNN performance.

Result: CGB achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CGB's focus on causality and graph refinement significantly advances brain disease detection using GNNs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship
between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant
improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do
not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs,
which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction
between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel
framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease
classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the
causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy.
CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to
enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also
performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the
generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential
information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that
CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain
disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

*Pedro C. Vieira, Miguel E. P. Silva, Pedro Manuel Pinto Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for direct motif significance-profile (SP) estimation using GNNs, shifting from traditional subgraph frequency counting to multitarget regression, improving interpretability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The application of GNNs to network motif SP prediction is under-explored, lacking benchmarks. The study aims to address this gap by reformulating SP estimation as an independent task.

Method: The approach reframes SP estimation as multitarget regression, optimizing for interpretability, stability, and scalability on large graphs. It is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Experiments show 1-WL limited models struggle with precise SP estimation but can generalize to approximate graph generation processes by comparing predicted SPs with synthetic ones.

Conclusion: Direct SP estimation with GNNs can overcome theoretical limitations of subgraph counting, offering a promising direction for motif estimation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph
representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their
application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains
under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to
address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph
frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP
estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The
reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on
large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and
further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited
models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can
generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by
comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic
generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how
using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that
motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

*Siru Ouyang, Xinyu Zhu, Zilin Xiao, Minhao Jiang, Yu Meng, Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAST, a method to transfer RL-induced probability adjustments from small to large models, enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying RL to large language models is resource-intensive, and RL doesn't add new knowledge but reshapes output distributions. The hypothesis is that these shifts are model-size invariant.

Method: Proposes RAST, which transfers RL-induced probability adjustments from a small RL-trained model to larger models.

Result: RAST improves reasoning in base models with lower GPU memory usage, sometimes outperforming direct RL training.

Conclusion: RAST offers a scalable, efficient way to leverage RL benefits without high computational costs, providing insights into RL-driven reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent
successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale
remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and
extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent
studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;
rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate
reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we
hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely
model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a
small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger
base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of
decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output
distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by
this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning
behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small
RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the
reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU
memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than
the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of
RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without
incurring its full computational cost. The project page of RAST is available at

*Le Jiang, Liyan Ma, Guang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for targeted noise injection in federated learning to defend against gradient inversion attacks, balancing privacy and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy leakage in federated learning, especially in healthcare, due to gradient inversion attacks, necessitates a nuanced defense mechanism.

Method: Uses a shadow model with interpretability to identify sensitive areas for sample-specific noise injection.

Result: Achieves significant privacy protection (3.73 PSNR, 0.2 SSIM on ChestXRay; 2.78 PSNR, 0.166 SSIM on EyePACS) with minimal model performance impact (<1% F1 reduction).

Conclusion: The framework effectively defends against gradient inversion attacks while preserving model accuracy, validated across diverse medical datasets.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

*Songqi Zhou, Ruixue Liu, Yixing Wang, Jia Lu, Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel BERT-style pretraining framework for battery fault detection improves accuracy by leveraging time-series data and self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture complex temporal dependencies and underutilize unlabeled data in battery fault detection.

Method: Extends BERT architecture with a time-series-to-token module and point-MSM pretraining task for self-supervised learning on battery data.

Result: Achieves AUROC of 0.945, outperforming existing methods in fault classification.

Conclusion: BERT-style pretraining is effective for time-series fault detection in batteries.

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe
and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal
dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large
language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their
architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common
in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by
extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token
representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM)
pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables
self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other
charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware
temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata
and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.
Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models
initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both
representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945
and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate
the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

*Michael T. M. B. Morris-Thomas, Marius Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model predicts floating offshore asset behavior with high accuracy, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail in extreme conditions and nonlinear responses, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Supervised machine learning with multivariate regression, combining gradient-boosted ensemble and a custom solver, trained on 1M samples.

Result: Achieved <5% error for mooring parameters and <2.5¬∞ heading accuracy, outperforming frequency-domain methods.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time monitoring and decision-making in offshore operations.

Abstract: The real-time prediction of floating offshore asset behavior under stochastic
metocean conditions remains a significant challenge in offshore engineering.
While traditional empirical and frequency-domain methods work well in benign
conditions, they struggle with both extreme sea states and nonlinear responses.
This study presents a supervised machine learning approach using multivariate
regression to predict the nonlinear motion response of a turret-moored vessel
in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a
gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver,
trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model
achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters
and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean
conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods.
The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility,
demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational
decision-making in offshore environments.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform (STLT) to replace self-attention in transformers, enabling dynamic adaptation of token relevance and frequency responses with scalable complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottleneck of self-attention in transformers while maintaining or improving performance, especially for ultra-long sequences.

Method: Introduces trainable parameters for Laplace nodes, fast recursive convolution, FFT-based relevance matrix computation, and adaptive node allocation.

Result: Achieves comparable or better perplexities and scores on tasks like language modeling, translation, and QA, extending to 100k+ token contexts.

Conclusion: The STLT combines interpretability, scalability, and robustness, offering a viable alternative to self-attention for long-sequence modeling.

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuronSeek-TD replaces symbolic regression with tensor decomposition to optimize neuron formulations, improving stability and convergence while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the human brain's task-specific neurons, the paper aims to develop task-driven neurons for deep learning networks.

Method: Uses tensor decomposition (TD) instead of symbolic regression (SR) to discover optimal neuron formulations and modifies aggregation functions with common activations.

Result: Achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and competitive performance against state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: NeuronSeek-TD provides a mathematically grounded framework for task-driven neurons, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for
different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a
network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping
task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression
(SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from
these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic
regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal
formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore,
we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions
with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of
parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small
error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek
framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD
framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive
relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks. The code is

### [448] [Alternates, Assemble! Selecting Optimal Alternates for Citizens' Assemblies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15716)
*Angelos Assos, Carmel Baharav, Bailey Flanigan, Ariel Procaccia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimization framework for selecting alternates in citizens' assemblies to improve representation by minimizing expected misrepresentation, using historical data and learning-theoretic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Citizens' assemblies rely on random selection for legitimacy, but dropout rates can skew representation. Existing methods ignore alternate selection, creating a gap this work addresses.

Method: The authors propose an algorithmic approach using learning-theoretic tools to estimate dropout probabilities and optimize alternate selection. Theoretical guarantees and empirical validation are provided.

Result: The method improves representation and reduces the number of alternates needed, as shown in real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution to enhance the legitimacy of citizens' assemblies by addressing dropout-related misrepresentation.

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on
citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions.
The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader
population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition.
Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their
selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap,
we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic
approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout
probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected
misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach,
including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for
computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping
out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates
that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves
representation while requiring fewer alternates.

*Zhengze Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Yiqun Shen, Simin Guo, Dahua Lin, Xiaoliang Wang, Nguyen Cam-Tu, Fei Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: daDPO (Distribution-Aware DPO) improves smaller LLMs' conversational abilities by leveraging teacher models' output distributions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LLMs lose conversational ability as size decreases, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. Current methods ignore teacher models' output distributions.

Method: Introduces daDPO, combining preference optimization and distribution-based distillation, validated theoretically and empirically.

Result: daDPO restores pruned model performance and enhances smaller LLMs, e.g., 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B nears teacher performance, Qwen2.5-1.5B sometimes beats its 7B teacher.

Conclusion: daDPO effectively bridges the performance gap between smaller and larger LLMs by utilizing teacher models' output distributions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BuildingBRep-11K is a dataset of 11,978 multi-storey buildings with detailed annotations, designed for training AI models in 3D object generation. It includes metadata and passes architectural standards. Two PointNet baselines demonstrate its learnability for regression and defect detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large, clean, and richly annotated datasets for training AI models in building-scale 3D object generation motivates the creation of BuildingBRep-11K.

Method: A shape-grammar-driven pipeline generates the dataset, incorporating design principles and multi-stage filters for quality. Two PointNet models are trained for multi-attribute regression and defect detection.

Result: The regression model achieves 0.37-storey MAE, 5.7-room MAE, and 3.2 m¬≤ MAE on mean area. The defect detection model reaches 54% accuracy, with 82% recall for true defects.

Conclusion: BuildingBRep-11K is learnable but challenging for geometric regression and topological quality assessment, proving its utility for AI research in 3D building generation.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, the automatic generation of
building-scale 3-D objects has become an active research topic, yet training
such models still demands large, clean and richly annotated datasets. We
introduce BuildingBRep-11K, a collection of 11 978 multi-storey (2-10 floors)
buildings (about 10 GB) produced by a shape-grammar-driven pipeline that
encodes established building-design principles. Every sample consists of a
geometrically exact B-rep solid-covering floors, walls, slabs and rule-based
openings-together with a fast-loading .npy metadata file that records detailed
per-floor parameters. The generator incorporates constraints on spatial scale,
daylight optimisation and interior layout, and the resulting objects pass
multi-stage filters that remove Boolean failures, undersized rooms and extreme
aspect ratios, ensuring compliance with architectural standards. To verify the
dataset's learnability we trained two lightweight PointNet baselines. (i)
Multi-attribute regression. A single encoder predicts storey count, total
rooms, per-storey vector and mean room area from a 4 000-point cloud. On 100
unseen buildings it attains 0.37-storey MAE (87 \% within $\pm1$), 5.7-room
MAE, and 3.2 m$^2$ MAE on mean area. (ii) Defect detection. With the same
backbone we classify GOOD versus DEFECT; on a balanced 100-model set the
network reaches 54 \% accuracy, recalling 82 \% of true defects at 53 \%
precision (41 TP, 9 FN, 37 FP, 13 TN). These pilots show that BuildingBRep-11K
is learnable yet non-trivial for both geometric regression and topological
quality assessment

*Manal Rahal, Bestoun S. Ahmed, Roger Renstrom, Robert Stener, Albrecht Wurtz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning (ML) approach combining predictive ML and anomaly detection to optimize heat pump (HP) efficiency for household hot water production. Key contributions include demand forecasting, feature selection, ML model tuning, and experimental validation, with LightGBM outperforming other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heat pumps are cost-effective and clean but limited by conventional control methods. ML optimization for household hot water demand forecasting is understudied.

Method: Combines predictive ML (LightGBM, LSTM, Bi-LSTM) with isolation forest (iForest) for demand forecasting and anomaly detection. Uses multi-step feature selection and time-series analysis.

Result: LightGBM achieved the best performance (RMSE improvements up to 9.37%, R¬≤ 0.748-0.983). iForest achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a 5.2% false alarm rate.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates strong generalization and suitability for real-world HP deployments, improving efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for
sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains
restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine
learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications,
optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied.
This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines
predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production
strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key
contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation
forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer
responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced
time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and
tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention
mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4)
experimental validation on six real household installations. Our experiments
show that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance,
with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$
values between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation
achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a false alarm rate of only 5.2\%,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household
types and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world HP
deployments.

TL;DR: A novel FSCIL method, Tri-WE, addresses catastrophic forgetting and overfitting by interpolating base, previous, and current models in weight-space and using amplified data distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed feature extractors in FSCIL limit adaptability to new classes, causing forgetting and overfitting.

Method: Tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE) interpolates models in weight-space, and amplified data distillation regularizes representation learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100.

Conclusion: Tri-WE effectively updates models with few examples while mitigating forgetting and overfitting.

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

*Junqi Gao, Zhichang Guo, Dazhi Zhang, Dong Li, Runze Liu, Pengfei Li, Kai Tian, Biqing Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bohdi is a synthetic-data-only framework for heterogeneous LLM fusion, addressing limitations of existing methods by enabling dynamic domain exploration and adaptive data sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LLM fusion rely on limited real data and fixed domain allocations, leading to incomplete knowledge acquisition and capability imbalance.

Method: Bohdi organizes knowledge domains hierarchically, uses multi-model collaboration for data generation, and adapts sampling via DynaBranches and IR mechanisms.

Result: Bohdi outperforms baselines, shows higher data efficiency, and balances capabilities across domains.

Conclusion: Bohdi effectively addresses fusion challenges, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for heterogeneous LLM integration.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of
multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low
computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major
limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion,
preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse
domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to
dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across
domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework.
Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree
structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data
generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively
extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data
sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical
Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism
to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance
feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth
(IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target
LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT),
further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental
results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi
significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits
higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target
LLM's capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: UNIMATE is a unified model for mechanical metamaterial design, addressing all three key modalities (3D topology, density condition, mechanical property) and outperforming baselines in tasks like topology generation and property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning models for mechanical metamaterials often only consider two of the three key modalities, leaving a gap for comprehensive solutions.

Method: UNIMATE combines a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion generation module to integrate all three modalities.

Result: UNIMATE outperforms baselines by up to 80.2% in topology generation, 5.1% in property prediction, and 50.2% in condition confirmation.

Conclusion: UNIMATE bridges the gap in metamaterial design by unifying all three modalities, with open-sourced results for further research.

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen
properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices.
In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved,
i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world
complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine
learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a
comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only
consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D
topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore,
there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning
models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE,
which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion
generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other
baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and
condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively. We
opensource our proposed UNIMATE model and corresponding results at

*Kunxi Li, Zhonghua Jiang, Zhouzhou Shen, Zhaode Wang, Chengfei Lv, Shengyu Zhang, Fan Wu, Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MadaKV is a modality-adaptive KV cache eviction strategy for MLLMs, improving efficiency in long-context inference by addressing modality disparities and reducing memory/latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KV cache eviction methods are unimodal and fail to handle modality-specific information, leading to suboptimal performance in multimodal scenarios.

Method: MadaKV uses modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation to dynamically retain critical tokens.

Result: Achieves 1.3-1.5x improvement in memory footprint and decoding latency while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: MadaKV outperforms existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness in multimodal long-context tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GrIDDD introduces a size-adaptive graph diffusion model for molecular generation, overcoming limitations of fixed graph sizes in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models cannot adapt graph size during generation, limiting their use in property-driven molecular design.

Method: Reformulates noising and denoising processes to allow monotonic node insertion/deletion, creating the GrIDDD model.

Result: GrIDDD matches/exceeds existing models in property targeting and shows competitive performance in molecular optimization.

Conclusion: GrIDDD enables size-adaptive molecular generation, advancing graph diffusion applications.

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular
generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom
and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited
by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms)
during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in
conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design,
where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this
paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic
insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD,
dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD
matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on
molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem.
Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits
competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work
paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is
pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in
particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on
small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular
foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the
Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to
predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional
approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical
simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich
molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and
MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,
outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop
(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)
and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity
cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's
learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,
highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results
underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and
effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further
exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.

TL;DR: DeepJ, a graph convolutional transformer model, improves modeling of medical event interactions in EHR data by capturing intra- and inter-encounter dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based approaches fail to model cross-encounter interactions and temporal dependencies in EHR data, limiting their effectiveness for patient outcome prediction.

Method: DeepJ combines graph convolutional networks with transformers and differentiable graph pooling to capture intra- and inter-encounter medical event interactions.

Result: DeepJ outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline models and enhances interpretability by identifying key event clusters for patient risk stratification.

Conclusion: DeepJ addresses limitations of static graph methods, offering improved modeling of longitudinal EHR data for better patient outcome insights.

Abstract: In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling
complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a
static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or
collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when
it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning
longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling
interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To
address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel
graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to
effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event
interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related
medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to
patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five
state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability,
demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification.

TL;DR: Proposes FedWB, a model fusion algorithm using Wasserstein barycenters for DNNs in distributed settings, and extends it to HFRL with DQNs in heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training global models in distributed architectures and heterogeneous federated reinforcement learning scenarios.

Method: Uses Wasserstein barycenters for aggregating DNN weights in FedWB and applies it to HFRL with DQNs in varying CartPole environments.

Result: Developed FedWB for DNN fusion and a global DQN for HFRL, tested on CartPole with heterogeneous pole lengths.

Conclusion: FedWB and the HFRL approach effectively generalize local models into global ones, validated by CartPole experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm for model fusion that
leverages Wasserstein barycenters in training a global Deep Neural Network
(DNN) in a distributed architecture. To this end, we divide the dataset into
equal parts that are fed to "agents" who have identical deep neural networks
and train only over the dataset fed to them (known as the local dataset). After
some training iterations, we perform an aggregation step where we combine the
weight parameters of all neural networks using Wasserstein barycenters. These
steps form the proposed algorithm referred to as FedWB. Moreover, we leverage
the processes created in the first part of the paper to develop an algorithm to
tackle Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Our test
experiment is the CartPole toy problem, where we vary the lengths of the poles
to create heterogeneous environments. We train a deep Q-Network (DQN) in each
environment to learn to control each cart, while occasionally performing a
global aggregation step to generalize the local models; the end outcome is a
global DQN that functions across all environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model using XGBoost for in-field calibration of low-cost air quality sensors improves accuracy by leveraging neighboring sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-cost sensors limit large-scale air quality monitoring, while low-cost sensors suffer from drift due to environmental and manufacturing issues.

Method: Proposes an XGBoost ensemble learning model to calibrate low-cost sensors using data from neighboring sensors.

Result: Reduces reliance on individual sensor accuracy and enhances generalization across locations.

Conclusion: The approach enables more effective large-scale air quality monitoring with improved sensor reliability.

Abstract: Effective large-scale air quality monitoring necessitates distributed sensing
due to the pervasive and harmful nature of particulate matter (PM),
particularly in urban environments. However, precision comes at a cost: highly
accurate sensors are expensive, limiting the spatial deployments and thus their
coverage. As a result, low-cost sensors have become popular, though they are
prone to drift caused by environmental sensitivity and manufacturing
variability. This paper presents a model for in-field sensor calibration using
XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors. This
approach reduces dependence on the presumed accuracy of individual sensors and
improves generalization across different locations.

TL;DR: Neural networks often mispredict confidence. This paper compares human and NN uncertainty, finding weak alignment. Using human-derived labels improves calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NNs are poorly calibrated, leading to overconfident predictions. Reliable uncertainty is critical for trustworthy AI.

Method: Compare human and NN uncertainty on vision benchmarks with human disagreement and confidence annotations.

Result: Current methods weakly align with human uncertainty. Human-derived labels improve calibration without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: A gap exists between human and model uncertainty. Human insights can enhance AI trustworthiness.

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but
remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong.
This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable
uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human
perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three
vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced
confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and
human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly
align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across
tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating
human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration
without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between
model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human
insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary RF Model) improves generative modeling by enforcing boundary conditions, outperforming vanilla RF with better FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vanilla Rectified Flow model's unconstrained neural network for velocity field learning fails to meet boundary conditions, causing inaccuracies, especially during stochastic sampling.

Method: Proposes Boundary RF Model, enforcing boundary conditions with minimal code changes to rectify velocity field estimation.

Result: Achieves 8.01% FID improvement on ImageNet with ODE sampling and 8.98% with SDE sampling.

Conclusion: Boundary RF Model effectively addresses boundary condition issues, enhancing generative modeling performance.

Abstract: Rectified Flow offers a simple and effective approach to high-quality
generative modeling by learning a velocity field. However, we identify a
limitation in directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural
network: the learned velocity often fails to satisfy certain boundary
conditions, leading to inaccurate velocity field estimations that deviate from
the desired ODE. This issue is particularly critical during stochastic sampling
at inference, as the score function's errors are amplified near the boundary.
To mitigate this, we propose a Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary
RF Model), in which we enforce boundary conditions with a minimal code
modification. Boundary RF Model improves performance over vanilla RF model,
demonstrating 8.01% improvement in FID score on ImageNet using ODE sampling and
8.98% improvement using SDE sampling.

TL;DR: POLCA identifies hidden training breakthroughs by decomposing loss changes along low-rank subspaces, revealing interpretable clusters of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visible discontinuities in loss curves may indicate breakthroughs, but many are obscured by scalar loss metrics. This paper aims to uncover hidden transitions for deeper learning insights.

Method: Introduces POLCA, a method to decompose loss changes along low-rank training subspaces, identifying clusters of samples with similar loss dynamics.

Result: Validated on synthetic and natural language tasks, POLCA successfully recovers interpretable clusters representing model capability breakthroughs.

Conclusion: POLCA offers a promising tool for unsupervised interpretability by revealing hidden phase transitions in training.

Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible
discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these
breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only
when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs
occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric
that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden
transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along
arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to
identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during
training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of
conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and
natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent
interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the
promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised
interpretability.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a transferable framework for job market analysis, despite synthetic data limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning methodology prototype using a large

for job seekers, employers, and researchers. Exploratory data analysis was
conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, regression
models were developed to predict salaries, classification models to predict job
titles, and clustering techniques were applied to group similar jobs. The
analyses revealed significant factors influencing salary and job roles, and
identified distinct job clusters based on the provided data. While the results
are based on synthetic data and not intended for real-world deployment, the

TL;DR: SHRED models, using RNNs and MLPs, are lightweight and effective for chaotic system prediction. The improved T-SHRED with transformers and SINDy attention enhances performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SHRED models by incorporating transformers for better temporal encoding and adding SINDy attention for symbolic regression, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

Method: Leverage transformers (T-SHRED) for temporal encoding and introduce SINDy attention for symbolic regression in the latent space.

Result: T-SHRED with SINDy attention accurately predicts future states and provides interpretable symbolic models across various datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced T-SHRED model outperforms SHRED, offering better prediction accuracy and interpretability through symbolic regression.

Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are effective for system identification
and forecasting from sparse sensor measurements. Such models are light-weight
and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops.
SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding
respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able
to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and
temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this
work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal
encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large
datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression
directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture.
Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and
regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the
performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from
low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED
accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model
across all tested datasets.

*Sheng Liu, Tianlang Chen, Pan Lu, Haotian Ye, Yizheng Chen, Lei Xing, James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fractional Reasoning is a training-free, model-agnostic framework for dynamically adjusting reasoning intensity at inference time, improving performance in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods apply uniform reasoning across inputs, ignoring varying problem complexities. Fractional Reasoning addresses this by enabling tailored reasoning depth.

Method: Extracts a latent steering vector for deeper reasoning and scales it dynamically, supporting breadth- and depth-based strategies.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA show consistent performance improvements across tasks and models.

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning offers flexible, input-adaptive reasoning, outperforming fixed methods in accuracy and correctness.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

TL;DR: The paper explores how contrastive examples (slightly differing instances with different labels) improve machine learning, focusing on their impact on active learners' sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how contrastive examples enhance learning by explaining label differences and their effect on sample complexity.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework to study contrastive examples' impact on active learners, using geometric and Boolean function classes.

Result: Reveals a connection between learning from contrastive examples and self-directed learning.

Conclusion: Contrastive examples significantly influence learning efficiency, bridging gaps with classical self-directed learning models.

Abstract: Machine learning can greatly benefit from providing learning algorithms with
pairs of contrastive training examples -- typically pairs of instances that
differ only slightly, yet have different class labels. Intuitively, the
difference in the instances helps explain the difference in the class labels.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which the effect of various
types of contrastive examples on active learners is studied formally. The focus
is on the sample complexity of learning concept classes and how it is
influenced by the choice of contrastive examples. We illustrate our results
with geometric concept classes and classes of Boolean functions. Interestingly,
we reveal a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the
classical model of self-directed learning.

*Yu Zhang, Gaoshan Bi, Simon Jeffery, Max Davis, Yang Li, Qing Xue, Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided graph neural network framework is proposed for precision soil GHG flux prediction, addressing data scarcity by integrating agricultural process-based models and graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision GHG flux prediction is crucial for sustainable agriculture, but data scarcity limits machine learning applications.

Method: The framework combines an agricultural process-based model for data simulation with autoencoder and multi-target multi-graph neural networks to extract features and integrate correlations.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and stability for GHG prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances GHG flux prediction, supporting sustainable agriculture.

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in
agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission
mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of
advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are
challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a
result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application
of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This
research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that
addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an
agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.
Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and
generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a
wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and
integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process,
we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and
multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the
autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the
agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network
to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict
fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world
agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with
well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability
in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajDiff is a new framework for trajectory similarity computation that addresses semantic gaps, noise, and global ranking issues, outperforming existing methods with a 33.38% average HR@1 gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trajectory similarity computation struggle with semantic gaps between GPS and grid features, noise in data, and lack of global ranking awareness.

Method: TrajDiff uses semantic alignment with cross-attention, noise-robust pre-training with DDBM, and ranking-aware regularization to improve trajectory embeddings.

Result: TrajDiff outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.38% average HR@1 gain across three datasets.

Conclusion: TrajDiff effectively addresses key challenges in trajectory similarity computation, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of
trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in
trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role
in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based
methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS
and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful
trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well
as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion
patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on
point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking
information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity
to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a
novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff.
Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an
attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating
semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified
representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training
introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model
training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall
ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global
perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show
that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In
particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three
evaluation metrics and datasets.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging
diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by
avoiding centralized storage. However, many existing approaches fail to account
for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation
that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this
work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity

F-test) and Random Forest-based multivariate ranking-yielded 19 interpretable
features. Seven ML models were trained with stratified 5-fold cross-validation
and SMOTE oversampling. Interpretability was assessed via ablation and
Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) analysis.

Result: Reduces MAE by 24.9%, correctly clusters all real-world design groups, and achieves up to 89% runtime reduction in a partitioning task.

Conclusion: Pieceformer is effective for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.

Abstract: Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design,
enabling the reuse of prior solutions to reduce engineering effort and
turnaround time. We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity
assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph
transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a
linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for
efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and
real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute
error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly
cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical
usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to
89% runtime reduction. These results validate the framework's effectiveness for

*Qianru Zhang, Honggang Wen, Ming Li, Dong Huang, Siu-Ming Yiu, Christian S. Jensen, Pietro Li√≤*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoHFormer is a hierarchical autoregressive transformer for time series forecasting, addressing temporal causality, scalability, and multi-scale pattern recognition with innovations like hierarchical modeling, dynamic windowed attention, and adaptive temporal encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve strict temporal causality, sub-quadratic complexity, and multi-scale pattern recognition in time series forecasting.

Method: Uses hierarchical temporal modeling, dynamic windowed attention, and adaptive temporal encoding.

Result: 10.76X faster training, 6.06X memory reduction vs. PatchTST, with consistent accuracy across long horizons.

Conclusion: AutoHFormer sets new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve
three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable
predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3)
multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We
introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal
Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks
processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This
dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient
computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs
learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while
preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the
anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks
of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system
is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed
oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for
long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X
faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,
while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of
cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise
time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in
hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at

*Soumya Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends bandit learning to two-sided reward uncertainty in matching markets, showing the Extended Gale-Shapley algorithm outperforms the standard GS algorithm in achieving stable matchings under incomplete information. It achieves logarithmic pessimal stable regret and adapts to decentralized settings with minimal regret increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused on single-sided uncertainty in matching markets. This work addresses the gap by studying two-sided reward uncertainty, aiming to improve stable matching under incomplete information.

Method: The paper leverages the concept of 'super-stability' and employs the Extended Gale-Shapley algorithm. It develops a centralized algorithm with logarithmic pessimal stable regret and adapts it to decentralized settings.

Result: The centralized algorithm achieves logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an admissible gap parameter. The decentralized adaptation incurs only a constant regret increase. A novel centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret is established.

Conclusion: The study highlights the advantage of the Extended GS algorithm in stable matching under incomplete information, providing theoretical insights into the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward
uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided
uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we
demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the
standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete
information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm
attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent
admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized
setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel
centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret,
elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in
characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

*Jina Kim, Youjin Jang, Jeongjin Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRAIL is a bi-level RL framework combining deep learning and reward shaping for interpretable feature attribution, improving stability and interpretability in RL tasks like Taxi-v3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and stability in value-based RL by learning meaningful weight representations from state features.

Method: Two-stage approach: DL for value function estimation (linear/quadratic) and RL for reward shaping via potential-based transformations.

Result: Improves training stability and convergence in Taxi-v3, identifies meaningful subgoals (e.g., passenger possession), and works without environment changes.

Conclusion: VRAIL is a model-agnostic framework that boosts both learning performance and interpretability in RL.

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable
Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL)
that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL
consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value
function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning
via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either
linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual
features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment
demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to
standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis
shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger
possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.
Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework
for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

*Esther Rodriguez, Monica Welfert, Samuel McDowell, Nathan Stromberg, Julian Antolin Camarena, Lalitha Sankar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models struggle with long-tailed data distributions, producing poor-quality tail-class samples due to overlapping latent representations. CORAL, a contrastive regularization method, improves tail-class generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-class data often follows long-tailed distributions, where standard diffusion models fail to generate diverse and high-quality samples for tail classes. The underlying cause of this degradation is unclear.

Method: The study investigates diffusion models on long-tailed datasets, identifying overlapping latent representations as the key issue. CORAL is proposed, using contrastive losses to separate latent class representations.

Result: CORAL significantly enhances the diversity and visual quality of tail-class samples compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The relative class imbalance, not just limited data, causes poor tail-class generation. CORAL effectively addresses this by aligning latent representations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating
high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically
assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings,
multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard
diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples
for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying
cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of
diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the
latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class
subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to
feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this
is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class
imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we
propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive
latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to
encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate
that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of
samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Traditional text-based chunking struggles with complex document structures, multi-page tables, and embedded figures, limiting RAG system performance.

Method: Uses LMMs to process PDF documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity.

Result: Improves chunk quality and downstream RAG performance, achieving better accuracy and superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach outperforms traditional RAG systems in handling complex documents.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information
retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods
struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures,
and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present a novel
multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models
(LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence
and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page
batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of
tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural
content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with
manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and
downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy
compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing
superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a fundamental model for sequential decision
making, where an agent selects a vector-valued action and receives a noisy
reward with expected value given by an unknown linear function. Although well
studied in the single-agent setting, many real-world scenarios involve multiple
agents solving heterogeneous bandit problems, each with a different unknown
parameter. Applying single agent algorithms independently ignores cross-agent
similarity and learning opportunities. This paper investigates the optimal
regret achievable in collaborative personalized linear bandits. We provide an
information-theoretic lower bound that characterizes how the number of agents,
the interaction rounds, and the degree of heterogeneity jointly affect regret.
We then propose a new two-stage collaborative algorithm that achieves the
optimal regret. Our analysis models heterogeneity via a hierarchical Bayesian
framework and introduces a novel information-theoretic technique for bounding
regret. Our results offer a complete characterization of when and how
collaboration helps with a optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{mn})$,
$\tilde{O}(dm^{1-\gamma}\sqrt{n})$, $\tilde{O}(dm\sqrt{n})$ for the number of
rounds $n$ in the range of $(0, \frac{d}{m \sigma^2})$, $[\frac{d}{m^{2\gamma}
\sigma^2}, \frac{d}{\sigma^2}]$ and $(\frac{d}{\sigma^2}, \infty)$
respectively, where $\sigma$ measures the level of heterogeneity, $m$ is the
number of agents, and $\gamma\in[0, 1/2]$ is an absolute constant. In contrast,
agents without collaboration achieve a regret bound $O(dm\sqrt{n})$ at best.

*Puchun Liu, C. L. Philip Chen, Yubin He, Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRIA is a novel EEG pretraining framework that integrates temporal, spectral, and spatial views using cross-attention and masking strategies, outperforming existing methods in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG pretraining methods lack the ability to capture multi-view interactions, limiting representation expressiveness and generalization.

Method: CRIA uses variable-length/channel coding, cross-attention for feature fusion, and a masking strategy based on the information bottleneck principle.

Result: Achieves 57.02% balanced accuracy for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: CRIA demonstrates strong generalization by effectively integrating multi-view EEG data, offering a robust pretraining framework.

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively
integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for
developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation
learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the
contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and
synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the
expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes
variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation
of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view
information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction
among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a
cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features
effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the
information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training
scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the
CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same
pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for
multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting
its strong generalization ability.

*Vinicius Yuiti Fukase, Heitor Gama, Barbara Bueno, Lucas Libanio, Anna Helena Reali Costa, Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to identify critical learning periods in deep neural network training, reducing computational costs and emissions without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works confirm critical learning periods but lack precise identification. This work fills the gap by systematically identifying these periods to optimize training efficiency.

Method: The approach uses generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint critical phases, halting resource-intensive techniques beyond these periods.

Result: The method reduces training time by up to 59.67%, CO$_2$ emissions by 59.47%, and costs by 60%, with no performance compromise.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of training dynamics and promotes sustainable deep learning, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep
learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many
training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the
existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the
literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In
this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for
identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks,
focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and
effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data
pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint
critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive
ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods,
we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in
training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on
standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method.
Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time
of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in
CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising
performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the
way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation
models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository

*Tianle Gu, Kexin Huang, Zongqi Wang, Yixu Wang, Jie Li, Yuanqi Yao, Yang Yao, Yujiu Yang, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in current safety alignment methods for AI, showing minor latent shifts can trigger unsafe responses. It introduces a probing method (ASA) and a training strategy (LAPT) to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods are shallow, focusing on surface-level behaviors, making models vulnerable to latent shifts that re-trigger harmful behaviors.

Method: Proposed a probing method (ASA) to measure latent sensitivity and introduced LAPT, a fine-tuning strategy using controlled perturbations in hidden representations.

Result: LAPT improved alignment robustness without degrading general capabilities, revealing vulnerabilities in current methods.

Conclusion: Current alignment paradigms are flawed; representation-level training (like LAPT) is needed for robust safety alignment.

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify under what conditions SAEs can uniquely and accurately recover ground truth monosemantic features from superposed polysemantic ones.

Method: Theoretical analysis to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs, followed by a reweighting strategy to narrow the loss function gap.

Result: Validated theoretical conditions and showed that weighted SAEs improve monosemanticity and interpretability.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and practical insights into improving SAEs for feature recovery, enhancing interpretability in large language models.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting
features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex
superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through
feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide
applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully
recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic
ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time
propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs
that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme
sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3)
enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions
are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the
identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight
selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE
reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that
the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic
features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our
theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves
feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods rely on predefined brain atlases but ignore embedded information and confounding effects of site/phenotype variability.

Result: B2P-GL achieves higher prediction accuracy on ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable, personalized approach for brain disorder diagnosis, enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using
functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook
the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of
site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates
the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph
modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage
brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine
the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network.
In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is
incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate
confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE
I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing
interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and
personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical
applicability.

TL;DR: LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by 50% while maintaining accuracy in long reasoning tasks by preserving recurring tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods struggle with long reasoning tasks, missing the Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon.

Method: Proposes LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework with Recurrence Interval Tracking and an eviction policy based on recurrence patterns.

Result: LazyEviction outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing KV cache size by 50% without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Preserving recurring tokens is crucial for knowledge continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by
employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences
introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache
size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as
mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate
memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance
Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention
after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and
may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To
address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed
to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an
Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring
tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two
key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal
variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric
Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by
50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance
of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge
continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The survey offers a structured understanding and future directions for developing generalizable brain FMs using SSL.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have
redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating
exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and
computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain
signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by
the scarcity of labeled neural data, SSL offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This
is particularly valuable in addressing the unique challenges of brain signals,
including high noise levels, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise
ratios. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of bridging brain
signals with foundation models through the innovative application of SSL. It
explores key SSL techniques, the development of brain-specific foundation
models, their adaptation to downstream tasks, and the integration of brain
signals with other modalities in multimodal SSL frameworks. The review also
covers commonly used evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets that support
comparative analysis. Finally, it highlights key challenges and outlines future

TL;DR: A unified framework for tensor decomposition using Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) on the Stiefel manifold, achieving linear convergence to ground-truth with polynomial scaling in tensor order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor decompositions reduce parameters for high-order tensors but face nonconvex optimization challenges. This work aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution.

Method: Leverages canonical tensor decomposition forms with orthonormal factors, applying RGD on the Stiefel manifold under mild loss function conditions.

Result: Proves RGD converges linearly to ground-truth tensors with polynomial scaling in tensor order, improving upon Tucker and tensor-train formats.

Conclusion: The framework offers efficient, scalable tensor decomposition with strong theoretical guarantees, advancing applications in signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics.

Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using
approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce
the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order
tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the
order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis
across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum
physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is
to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as
gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and
tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly
nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing
significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach
to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging
the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained
to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient
descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.
Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian
regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges
to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably,
both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially
rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker
and tensor-train format tensors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reproducibility in ML, especially in dynamic, collaborative eScience projects with fragmented workflows.

Method: Introduces a data-centric framework with six artifacts (Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, Controlled Vocabulary) to formalize relationships between data, code, and decisions.

Result: Demonstrated in a clinical ML use case (glaucoma detection), showing improved reproducibility, iterative exploration, and provenance tracking.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reproducibility and adaptability in ML workflows by formalizing and versioning artifacts.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML),
especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data,
features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented,
relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools.
This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability
of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for
lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts:
Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These
artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions,
enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over
time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma
detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves
reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across
the ML lifecycle.

*Simardeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study examines how knowledge distillation (KD) from a large teacher model to smaller student variants affects memorization of fine-tuned task data, showing KD reduces memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and security concerns by understanding how KD impacts memorization in LLMs, as previous research focused on pre-trained models.

Method: Investigate different KD methods when distilling a large teacher model (fine-tuned on a dataset) into smaller student variants.

Result: KD not only lowers computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces memorization risks.

Conclusion: KD is a promising approach to mitigate memorization risks while maintaining efficiency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training
data, raising important concerns around privacy and security. While previous
research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less
is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this
study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of
fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller
student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher
model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers
computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the
memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

### [492] [Floating-Point Neural Networks Are Provably Robust Universal Approximators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16065)
*Geonho Hwang, Wonyeol Lee, Yeachan Park, Sejun Park, Feras Saad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first interval universal approximation (IUA) theorem for floating-point neural networks, proving their ability to perfectly capture the direct image map of any rounded target function, with surprising corollaries like provably robust networks and computational completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between theoretical UA/IUA theorems (assuming infinite precision) and practical implementations (using finite-precision floating-point numbers), exploring whether IUA holds in the floating-point setting.

Method: The paper introduces a novel IUA theorem specifically for floating-point neural networks, analyzing their expressiveness and differences from the real-valued setting.

Result: The result shows that floating-point neural networks can perfectly approximate the direct image map of any rounded target function, with additional corollaries like provable robustness and computational completeness.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the material differences between real-valued and floating-point settings and the surprising implications of the IUA theorem for floating-point neural networks.

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks
establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can
approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result
shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal
approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation
semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct
image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with
arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption
that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas
their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision
floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds
in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural
networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct
image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their
expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material
differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental
distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies
surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust
floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the
class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and
multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

### [493] [A Lightweight RL-Driven Deep Unfolding Network for Robust WMMSE Precoding in Massive MU-MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16072)
*Kexuan Wang, An Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight RL-driven deep unfolding network (RLDDU-Net) to improve the WMMSE precoding algorithm for massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems under imperfect CSI, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical deployment of WMMSE precoding in massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems is limited by perfect CSI assumptions and high computational complexity.

Method: Develops a wideband stochastic WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm and integrates it into RLDDU-Net, which uses deep unfolding and RL to optimize performance.

Result: RLDDU-Net outperforms baselines in ergodic weighted sum-rate (EWSR) performance under imperfect CSI, with improved computational and convergence efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed RLDDU-Net effectively addresses the limitations of WMMSE precoding, offering a practical solution for massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems.

Abstract: Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding is widely recognized for
its near-optimal weighted sum rate performance. However, its practical
deployment in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is hindered by the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) and high computational
complexity. To address these issues, we first develop a wideband stochastic
WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm that iteratively maximizes the ergodic weighted
sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI. Building on this, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net),
where each SWMMSE iteration is mapped to a network layer. Specifically, its DU
module integrates approximation techniques and leverages beam-domain sparsity
as well as frequency-domain subcarrier correlation, significantly accelerating
convergence and reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the RL module
adaptively adjusts the network depth and generates compensation matrices to
mitigate approximation errors. Simulation results under imperfect CSI
demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in EWSR performance
while offering superior computational and convergence efficiency.

*Abdulvahap Mutlu, ≈ûeng√ºl Doƒüan, T√ºrker Tuncer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A CWGAN is used to generate synthetic ALS EEG signals to address data scarcity and class imbalance, improving classifier training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and class imbalance in ALS EEG recordings hinder reliable machine learning classifier training.

Method: A CWGAN is trained on a private EEG dataset to generate synthetic ALS signals, with detailed preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Generated signals mimic real ALS EEG patterns, and the CWGAN training converged successfully.

Conclusion: Synthetic EEG signals can augment training data, mitigate class imbalance, and enhance ALS detection accuracy.

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and
high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled
with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a
challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we
address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using
a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train
CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of
ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and
normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS
signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key
hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated
signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training
converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating
successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have
potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate
class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this
approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

*Kexuan Wang, An Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CRL algorithm, CAAC, dynamically optimizes WMMSE precoding for 6G networks, improving energy efficiency and QoS adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional WMMSE precoding lacks flexibility for user-specific QoS and dynamic channel conditions.

Method: Proposes CAAC, integrating CSSCA for policy optimization and attention-enhanced Q-networks for efficient learning.

Result: CAAC outperforms baselines in energy efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

Conclusion: CAAC offers a flexible and efficient solution for 6G networks.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are expected to support diverse quality-of-service (QoS)
demands while maintaining high energy efficiency. Weighted Minimum Mean Square
Error (WMMSE) precoding with fixed user priorities and transmit power is widely
recognized for enhancing overall system performance but lacks flexibility to
adapt to user-specific QoS requirements and time-varying channel conditions. To
address this, we propose a novel constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)
algorithm, Constrained-Actor Attentive-Critic (CAAC), which uses a policy
network to dynamically allocate user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding.
Specifically, CAAC integrates a Constrained Stochastic Successive Convex
Approximation (CSSCA) method to optimize the policy, enabling more effective
handling of energy efficiency goals and satisfaction of stochastic non-convex
QoS constraints compared to traditional and existing CRL methods. Moreover,
CAAC employs lightweight attention-enhanced Q-networks to evaluate policy
updates without prior environment model knowledge. The network architecture not
only enhances representational capacity but also boosts learning efficiency.
Simulation results show that CAAC outperforms baselines in both energy
efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

*Langzhang Liang, Fanchen Bu, Zixing Song, Zenglin Xu, Shirui Pan, Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph rewiring method using spectrum-preserving sparsification to mitigate over-squashing in GNNs, balancing connectivity and property preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing over-squashing in GNNs caused by structural bottlenecks, while preserving critical graph properties like spectral features.

Method: Proposes spectrum-preserving graph sparsification to rewire graphs, enhancing connectivity without increasing edge count or losing spectral properties.

Result: Improved classification accuracy and better retention of the Laplacian spectrum compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces over-squashing while preserving graph properties, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with
exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural
bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as
\textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring},
which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph
rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of
the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many
approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which
introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of
over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that
leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for
mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced
connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original
graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph
property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in
classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI speech-to-text tools (Faster Whisperer and YouTube's internal function) for transcribing Finnish rap lyrics, measuring errors against original lyrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finnish is complex, and artistic use (like rap) adds difficulty, making it a fun yet challenging test for AI transcription.

Method: Compare Faster Whisperer and YouTube's speech-to-text against Mc Timo's Finnish rap lyrics, measuring errors due to music and artistic pronunciation.

Result: The study measures AI hallucination and mishearing levels by comparing transcriptions to original lyrics.

Conclusion: The informal error function provides insights into AI's performance on challenging linguistic tasks like Finnish rap.

Abstract: All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to
understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language.
Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might
be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet
challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the
Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality.
The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little
brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging
because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The
hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be
measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The
error function is informal but still works for our case.

*Xun Wang, Jing Xu, Franziska Boenisch, Michael Backes, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POST enables private tuning of soft prompts on small models for transfer to larger LLMs, reducing costs and preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft prompts are tied to specific LLMs, raising efficiency and privacy concerns due to high computational costs and data sharing requirements.

Method: POST uses knowledge distillation to create a small model from a large LLM, tunes soft prompts locally (with optional differential privacy), and transfers them back using a public dataset.

Result: POST reduces computational costs, ensures privacy, and successfully transfers high-utility soft prompts.

Conclusion: POST addresses efficiency and privacy issues in soft prompt tuning, offering a viable solution for LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models
(LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their
interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in
APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples
while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context
window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to
the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This
constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning
prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs
continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,
soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.
For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these
issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that
enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently
transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to
derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt
transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential
privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small
public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,
preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

### [499] [Next-Token Prediction Should be Ambiguity-Sensitive: A Meta-Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16288)
*Leo Gagnon, Eric Elmoznino, Sarthak Mittal, Tom Marty, Tejas Kasetty, Dhanya Sridhar, Guillaume Lajoie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of auto-regressive models in handling high-ambiguity predictions and proposes a method inspired by cognitive science to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-regressive models struggle with high-ambiguity predictions due to computational intractability, prompting the need for alternative strategies like heuristics or information-seeking methods.

Method: The authors introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic benchmark, and propose converting pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors to decouple task inference from token prediction.

Result: Transformers struggle with high-ambiguity predictions, but the proposed method shows preliminary gains in ambiguous contexts through better capacity allocation and scalable inference.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of cognitive-inspired methods to address ambiguity in auto-regressive models, though challenges remain.

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often
attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a
Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires
integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations.
While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in
practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives
makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science
has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions,
heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive
inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize
that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,
making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.
To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning
benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We
show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across
model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert
pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference
from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous
contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference,
though challenges remain.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel ML technique using coupled JEPAs to optimize radio resource management in control systems, reducing power usage by 50% without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize radio resource management in communication systems between controllers and devices without compromising control performance.

Method: Uses two coupled JEPAs (control and wireless) to model dynamics, trains RL for control policy, and predicts power scheduling.

Result: Reduces transmit power by over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively minimizes radio resource usage by leveraging latent space predictions.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to optimize the radio resource management of a
communication system between a remote controller and its device, whose state is
represented through image frames, without compromising the performance of the
control task. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) technique to jointly
model and predict the dynamics of the control system as well as the wireless
propagation environment in latent space. Our method leverages two coupled
joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the
control dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures
the dynamics of the device's channel state information (CSI) through
cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power
predictor to estimate scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions
based on latent CSI representations. As such, the controller minimizes the
usage of radio resources by utilizing the coupled JEPA networks to imagine the
device's trajectory in latent space. We present simulation results on synthetic
multimodal data and show that our proposed approach reduces transmit power by
over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods
that do not account for wireless optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENN-GFN-Enhanced integrates epistemic neural networks with GFlowNets for better uncertainty-driven exploration and trajectory identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of efficiently identifying optimal training trajectories in GFlowNets due to insufficient reward distribution learning.

Method: Combines epistemic neural networks (ENN) with GFlowNets to improve joint predictions and uncertainty quantification.

Result: ENN-GFN-Enhanced outperforms baseline methods in grid environments and structured sequence generation.

Conclusion: The integration of ENN with GFlowNets enhances exploration and trajectory identification, proving effective and efficient.

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open
problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize
exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not
been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in
other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute
can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for
combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate
epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets
to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty
quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal
trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the
baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured
sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: BLANCE is a Bayesian framework combining batch data and LM-derived knowledge for causal discovery, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of batch data arrival and scarce expert knowledge in causal discovery, leveraging LMs while mitigating their biases and inconsistencies.

Method: Uses a hybrid Bayesian framework integrating sequential batch data and LM-derived knowledge, shifting from DAG to PAG representation, and employs adaptive edge querying.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in structural accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM noise.

Conclusion: BLANCE effectively bridges gaps in causal discovery by adaptively combining data and LM knowledge, offering improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data typically assumes full access to
data and availability of domain experts. In practice, data often arrive in
batches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a
surrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and
bias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid
Bayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential
batch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both
data-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates
ambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global
LM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a
sequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative
edges. Across varied datasets, BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural
accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM
noise.

TL;DR: First token-level watermarking for autoregressive image models, addressing reverse cycle-consistency and robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Track provenance of generative model outputs, especially autoregressive image models, which lack prior token-level watermarking solutions.

Method: Adapt language model watermarking, improve reverse cycle-consistency via tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning, and add a watermark synchronization layer.

Result: Reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.

Conclusion: The approach effectively watermarks autoregressive image model outputs, addressing key challenges like RCC and attack robustness.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

*Jacopo Iollo, Geoffroy Oudoumanessah, Carole Lartizien, Michel Dojat, Florence Forbes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED) method to optimize MRI acquisition by adaptively selecting informative measurements, balancing speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerate MRI acquisition times without degrading image quality by balancing under-sampling and sufficient raw data for high-fidelity reconstruction.

Method: Uses sequential BED with gradient-based optimization to select measurements maximizing information gain, leveraging diffusion-based generative models and stochastic optimization.

Result: Demonstrates versatility and performance in optimizing MRI acquisitions for both reconstruction and analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances acquisition speed and image quality, adaptable to various MRI tasks.

Abstract: A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without
significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance
between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and
gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and
analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection
of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented
with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior
distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based
optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this
work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based
generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs
stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the
acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting
can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated
image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are
demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the cost and overhead of customizing large language models (LLMs) by eliminating the need for separate optimization runs for each downstream dataset.

Method: Uses a lightweight text encoder and hyper-convolutional decoder to map task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates, trained on diverse prompt-checkpoint pairs.

Result: Achieves up to 12,000x lower overhead than full fine-tuning, 30% performance gains over LoRAs, and robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Prompt-conditioned parameter generation is a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing LLMs.

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
\textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize profit while mitigating loss in dynamic betting scenarios, ensuring fairness and financial safety for bookmakers.

Method: Develops an efficient algorithm based on the Bellman-Pareto frontier, unifying dynamic programming and multi-criteria optimization.

Result: The bookmaker's optimal loss is characterized by a polynomial root, with the algorithm achieving optimal loss against optimal gamblers and reducing loss otherwise.

Conclusion: Bookmakers can balance fairness and risk, with the solution revealing a connection between regret and Hermite polynomials.

Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates
betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the
bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of
gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show
that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting
over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal
loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that
bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the
explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the
bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm
that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler,
the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is
suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a
notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical
contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the
Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for
Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the
Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.

### [507] [Optimizing MoE Routers: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation in Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16419)
*Daniel Fidel Harvey, George Weale, Berk Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores router architectures in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, comparing six variants for efficiency and performance, with MLP-Hadamard showing unique sparse routing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address load imbalance and accuracy issues in MoE models caused by poor routing, the study designs and evaluates various router architectures.

Method: Six router variants (Linear, Attention, MLP, Hybrid, Hash, MLP-Hadamard) were tested in Transformer models (BERT, Qwen1.5-MoE), analyzing parameter efficiency, latency, entropy, and expert utilization.

Result: Linear routers are faster, MLP/Attention routers are more expressive, and MLP-Hadamard excels in structured, sparse routing. Custom routers were successfully fine-tuned in Qwen1.5-MoE.

Conclusion: The study provides a comparative analysis of MoE routers, offering insights for optimizing large-scale model deployment.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model
scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves
tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced
accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures
within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six
distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using
BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference
latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations
showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention
routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique
capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and
fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This
work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights
into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model
deployment.

### [508] [Latent Concept Disentanglement in Transformer-based Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16975)
*Guan Zhe Hong, Bhavya Vasudeva, Vatsal Sharan, Cyrus Rashtchian, Prabhakar Raghavan, Rina Panigrahy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether transformers in LLMs represent latent structures during in-context learning (ICL) or take shortcuts. It shows transformers identify and compose latent concepts in discrete and continuous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if transformers truly grasp latent concepts in ICL or rely on shortcuts, addressing gaps in prior mechanistic work.

Method: Examines transformers in 2-hop reasoning tasks (discrete latent concepts) and continuous latent concept tasks, analyzing representation subspaces.

Result: Transformers successfully identify and compose latent concepts in discrete tasks and mimic continuous parameterization in low-dimensional subspaces.

Conclusion: The findings refine understanding of ICL, showing localized structures in transformers that disentangle latent concepts.

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'anomaly signatures' to improve interpretability in machine learning-based anomaly detection by highlighting contributing features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning outputs, like anomaly detection, are often opaque, leaving users to manually analyze why events are flagged as anomalies.

Method: The authors propose the concept of 'anomaly signatures' to identify and highlight features that contribute to anomaly detection decisions.

Result: The approach aims to make anomaly detection more interpretable by clarifying the reasoning behind flagged anomalies.

Conclusion: Anomaly signatures enhance transparency in machine learning, aiding users in understanding anomaly detection outputs.

Abstract: Machine learning is often viewed as a black box when it comes to
understanding its output, be it a decision or a score. Automatic anomaly
detection is no exception to this rule, and quite often the astronomer is left
to independently analyze the data in order to understand why a given event is
tagged as an anomaly. We introduce here idea of anomaly signature, whose aim is
to help the interpretability of anomalies by highlighting which features
contributed to the decision.

TL;DR: PINNs solve PDEs using neural networks. Influence functions from XAI improve training data sampling, boosting prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance PINN training by applying influence functions for targeted resampling, improving interpretability and accuracy.

Method: Use influence functions to identify impactful training points and resample data for PINN training.

Result: Targeted resampling improves prediction accuracy in PINNs.

Conclusion: XAI methods like influence functions can optimize PINN training, demonstrating practical benefits in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative
sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various
scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field
of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data
-- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily
available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI),
approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing
interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence
function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate
that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the
potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks,
demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

*Jingtong Su, Julia Kempe, Karen Ullrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMD and SAMI, methods to map complex concepts to transformer attention heads and adjust their effects, improving interpretability and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in current attribution research, which overlooks attention mechanisms and lacks a unified approach for complex concepts.

Method: SAMD maps concepts to attention heads using cosine similarity, while SAMI adjusts module effects with a scalar parameter.

Result: Demonstrates stable module locations, improves jailbreaking (+72.7%) and reasoning (+1.6%), and suppresses vision transformer accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach is domain-agnostic, enhancing interpretability and behavioral control in transformers.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

*Huy Hoang Nguyen, Han Zhou, Matthew B. Blaschko, Aleksei Tiulpin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Beta kernel for Bayesian optimization, outperforming Mat√©rn and RBF kernels in bounded domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing kernels like Mat√©rn and RBF lack assumptions about function domains, limiting their effectiveness in bounded domains.

Method: Proposes the Beta kernel, a non-stationary kernel based on Beta distributions, to model functions in bounded domains.

Result: Empirical evidence shows the Beta kernel's exponential eigendecay and superior performance in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The Beta kernel is robust and outperforms traditional kernels in bounded domains, enhancing optimization tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to
optimize black-box functions. The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF)
covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions
about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in
bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a
non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density
functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on
bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that
the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses
of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima
located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show
that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the
well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic
function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a deep learning model for EEG-based emotion recognition in real-life contexts, leveraging recent EEG technology and machine learning advances.

Method: Utilizes multi-scale CNNs with feature extraction kernels of varying ratios and a new kernel type that learns from four brain areas.

Result: The model consistently outperforms TSception in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance scores across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for EEG-based emotion recognition, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: EEG is a non-invasive, safe, and low-risk method to record
electrophysiological signals inside the brain. Especially with recent
technology developments like dry electrodes, consumer-grade EEG devices, and
rapid advances in machine learning, EEG is commonly used as a resource for
automatic emotion recognition. With the aim to develop a deep learning model
that can perform EEG-based emotion recognition in a real-life context, we
propose a novel approach to utilize multi-scale convolutional neural networks
to accomplish such tasks. By implementing feature extraction kernels with many
ratio coefficients as well as a new type of kernel that learns key information
from four separate areas of the brain, our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art TSception model in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance
scores across many performance evaluation metrics.

Motivation: Addressing the challenges of scalability, adaptability, and safety in building energy management due to increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity.

Method: 1. Clustering non-shiftable load profiles for policy generalization. 2. LSTM-based forecasting for dynamic responsiveness. 3. Domain-informed action masking for safe operation.

Result: Reduces operating costs by up to 15%, maintains stable environmental performance, and quickly optimizes new buildings with limited data. Adapts to tariff changes without retraining.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, robust, and cost-effective building energy management.

Abstract: Increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity have
placed buildings at the center of sustainable energy management. We present a
three-step reinforcement learning(RL)-based Building Energy Management System
(BEMS) that combines clustering, forecasting, and constrained policy learning
to address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges. First, we cluster
non-shiftable load profiles to identify common consumption patterns, enabling
policy generalization and transfer without retraining for each new building.
Next, we integrate an LSTM based forecasting module to anticipate future
states, improving the RL agents' responsiveness to dynamic conditions. Lastly,
domain-informed action masking ensures safe exploration and operation,
preventing harmful decisions. Evaluated on real-world data, our approach
reduces operating costs by up to 15% for certain building types, maintains
stable environmental performance, and quickly classifies and optimizes new
buildings with limited data. It also adapts to stochastic tariff changes
without retraining. Overall, this framework delivers scalable, robust, and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensorGuide improves LoRA by using a tensor-train-guided framework to generate correlated low-rank matrices, enhancing expressivity, generalization, and parameter efficiency without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's independent optimization of low-rank matrices limits expressivity and generalization, while classical TT decomposition fails to improve efficiency or performance.

Method: TensorGuide employs a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise to create correlated low-rank LoRA matrices.

Result: TensorGuide outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA in accuracy and scalability on quantum dot classification and GPT-2 fine-tuning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TensorGuide provides a superior, parameter-efficient adaptation framework with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently
optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and
generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition
can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates
that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter
efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes
TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these
limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices
through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The
resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank
adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and
parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.
Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel
analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced
generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2
fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently
outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and
scalability with fewer parameters.

Motivation: To provide a scalable, low-cost solution for precision livestock monitoring, especially in resource-limited settings.

Method: Deployed Bluetooth collars with accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, used CCTV footage for labeling, and tested SVM, RF, CNN, and LSTM models for behavior classification and estrus detection.

Result: Achieved 93% behavior classification accuracy and 96% estrus detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The system is effective, scalable, and accessible for livestock monitoring.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system for monitoring cattle behavior and
detecting estrus (heat) periods using sensor data and machine learning. We
designed and deployed a low-cost Bluetooth-based neck collar equipped with
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to capture real-time behavioral data from
real cows, which was synced to the cloud. A labeled dataset was created using
synchronized CCTV footage to annotate behaviors such as feeding, rumination,
lying, and others. We evaluated multiple machine learning models -- Support
Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) -- for behavior classification. Additionally, we implemented a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for estrus detection using behavioral patterns
and anomaly detection. Our system achieved over 93% behavior classification
accuracy and 96% estrus detection accuracy on a limited test set. The approach
offers a scalable and accessible solution for precision livestock monitoring,

TL;DR: PITA introduces a novel framework combining annealing and diffusion smoothing for efficient sampling from unnormalized densities, enabling equilibrium sampling of complex systems like N-body particles and peptides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient sampling from unnormalized densities is crucial for scientific applications, but existing diffusion-based samplers fail at molecular scales.

Method: PITA combines annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and diffusion smoothing, training sequential diffusion models from high to low temperatures and using inference-time annealing with a novel Feynman-Kac PDE and Sequential Monte Carlo.

Result: PITA achieves equilibrium sampling of complex systems (N-body particles, Alanine Dipeptide, tripeptides) with fewer energy evaluations.

Conclusion: PITA advances diffusion-based sampling, enabling practical applications in molecular systems.

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a
core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific
applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of
amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from
state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing
diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at
the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn
diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation
techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion
smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low
temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher
temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the
temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables
simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower
temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using
a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA
enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,
Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically
lower energy function evaluations. Code available at:

Motivation: Black-box models lack interpretability of system dynamics, prompting the need for a more transparent approach.

Method: SS-KAN combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with state-space modeling, validated on Silverbox and Wiener-Hammerstein benchmarks.

Result: SS-KAN offers enhanced interpretability through sparsity-promoting regularization and visualization of learned univariate functions, though with slight accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: SS-KAN is a promising method for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability
of the underlying system dynamics. This paper proposes State-Space
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SS-KAN) to address this challenge by integrating
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model
is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein
benchmarks. Results show that SS-KAN provides enhanced interpretability due to
sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned
univariate functions, which reveal system nonlinearities at the cost of
accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art black-box models, highlighting
SS-KAN as a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system
identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability of nonlinear system
dynamics.

TL;DR: GoalLadder uses vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL agents from a single language instruction in visual environments, outperforming competitors with a 95% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robotic systems to learn from human guidance by extracting rewards from language instructions, addressing challenges in visual environments.

Method: Leverages VLMs to incrementally discover task-progress states, ranks them using pairwise comparisons and an ELO-based system, and minimizes distance to top-ranked goals in a learned embedding space.

Result: Achieves an average final success rate of ~95%, significantly outperforming competitors (~45%).

Conclusion: GoalLadder effectively bypasses the need for abundant feedback, providing a robust method for training RL agents from language instructions in visual environments.

Abstract: Natural language can offer a concise and human-interpretable means of
specifying reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The ability to extract rewards
from a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that
can learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,
especially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,
pretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment
representations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate
noisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL
agents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder
works by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to
completing a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to
identify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to
rank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not
trust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal
states using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects
of noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with
minimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,
which is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to
bypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train
a well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms
existing related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation
environments with the average final success rate of $\sim$95% compared to only
$\sim$45% of the best competitor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Directo, the first generative model for directed graphs, addressing challenges in modeling edge directionality and lack of benchmarks. It combines positional encodings, dual-attention, and a discrete framework, outperforming specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed graphs are crucial in various fields, but their generation is underexplored due to challenges like complex dependency spaces and lack of standardized benchmarks.

Method: Directo uses discrete flow matching, with tailored positional encodings, a dual-attention mechanism, and a robust generative framework.

Result: Directo performs strongly across diverse settings, even competing with specialized models, and introduces a benchmark suite for evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a solid foundation for directed graph generation, demonstrating Directo's effectiveness and generality.

Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered
relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social
networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such
as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however,
directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors
limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality
introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying
distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks
hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive
models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the
first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow
matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings
tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism
capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete
generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite
covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs
strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for
particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the
effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation
for future research in directed graph generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diminishing returns in model merging caused by rank collapse in task vector spaces.

Method: Introduces Subspace Boosting, which maintains task vector ranks using singular value decomposition, and employs Higher-Order Generalized SVD for task similarity analysis.

Result: Subspace Boosting improves merging efficacy by over 10% for up to 20 expert models on vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: Subspace Boosting effectively mitigates rank collapse, enhancing model merging performance and providing interpretable task similarity insights.

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

*Dian Meng, Zhiguang Cao, Yaoxin Wu, Yaqing Hou, Hongwei Ge, Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EFormer, an Edge-based Transformer model, improves VRP solutions by using edge inputs and parallel encoding, outperforming baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural heuristics for VRPs rely on node coordinates, which may not reflect real-world edge-based cost metrics effectively.

Method: EFormer uses edge inputs, a precoder module for node embeddings, and parallel encoding (graph and node encoders) for global edge relationships. Decoding involves parallel context embedding and multi-query integration.

Result: EFormer outperforms baselines on TSP and CVRP, including large-scale and diverse datasets, and generalizes well to real-world instances.

Conclusion: EFormer's design effectively addresses VRP limitations by leveraging edge-based inputs and parallel encoding, demonstrating strong performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recent neural heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) primarily rely
on node coordinates as input, which may be less effective in practical
scenarios where real cost metrics-such as edge-based distances-are more
relevant. To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based
Transformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach
employs a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert
edge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel
encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each
responsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature
spaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of
the global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context
embedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention
mechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path
construction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer
outperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale
and diverse distributions. Moreover, EFormer demonstrates strong generalization
on real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. These findings confirm the
effectiveness of EFormer's core design in solving VRPs.

### [524] [One Sample is Enough to Make Conformal Prediction Robust](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16553)
*Soroush H. Zargarbashi, Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh, Aleksandar Bojchevski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCP1, a single-sample robust conformal prediction method that reduces computational cost while maintaining robustness and smaller prediction sets compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust conformal prediction (RCP) methods using randomized smoothing are computationally expensive due to multiple model forward passes per input. The goal is to achieve robustness with fewer passes.

Method: The authors propose RCP1, which uses a single randomly perturbed input and a binary certificate to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself, not individual scores. This method is applicable to classification and regression.

Result: RCP1 achieves robust prediction sets with smaller average size compared to state-of-the-art methods that require many (e.g., 100) passes per input.

Conclusion: RCP1 offers a computationally efficient and robust alternative to existing RCP methods, with broader applicability to different setups like conformal risk control.

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed
to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP)
extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to
use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model
and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current
smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is
computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some
robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using
any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our
approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA
methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is
to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual
scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression).
We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk
control.

*John Abascal, Nicol√°s Berrios, Alina Oprea, Jonathan Ullman, Adam Smith, Matthew Jagielski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy risks in multitask learning (MTL) by analyzing shared representations, proposing black-box task-inference attacks, and demonstrating their effectiveness across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL's shared representations, while efficient, may leak sensitive task information, raising privacy concerns.

Method: Proposes black-box task-inference attacks using embedding vectors without shadow models or labeled data.

Result: Shows adversaries can infer task inclusion in training using fresh samples, validated across vision and language domains.

Conclusion: Highlights privacy risks in MTL and provides theoretical insights into adversary capabilities.

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages
similarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to
train a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data
sharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by
learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks
by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being
designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively
learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can
inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were
trained on.
  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared
representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose
a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the
embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples
from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when
training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box
attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between
embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled
reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for
multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh
task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully
infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide
theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict
separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the
target task's distribution.

*Amir Reza Vazifeh, Jason W. Fleischer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NLDR techniques like t-SNE and UMAP effectively analyze ECG signals without training, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing arrhythmias and individual recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ECG analysis is error-prone and time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods struggle with signal variability and lack of labeled data.

Method: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques (t-SNE and UMAP) are applied to ECG signals from the MIT-BIH dataset to identify medically relevant features without training.

Result: NLDR achieved >=90% accuracy in discriminating individual recordings and 98.96% median accuracy with 91.02% F1-score for arrhythmia classification.

Conclusion: NLDR shows promise for automated ECG analysis, including single-lead and 12-lead applications, and extends potential to personalized healthcare beyond cardiology.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart
activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring
cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and
prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for
automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations
in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals
can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow
different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder
supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component
analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and
typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are
missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.
Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate
these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no
need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the
MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate
individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish
different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%
and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise
for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the
current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond
cardiology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoRA introduces contextual sparsity to accelerate LLM fine-tuning, reducing computational cost by up to 2.2√ó and achieving 1.6√ó speedup while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g., QLoRA, DoRA) reduce memory usage but not computational cost, sometimes slowing fine-tuning. SparseLoRA addresses this gap.

Method: Uses a lightweight, training-free SVD sparsity estimator to dynamically select sparse weights for loss/gradient computation, with systematic sensitivity analysis.

Result: Achieves up to 2.2√ó computational cost reduction and 1.6√ó speedup, maintaining accuracy across tasks like reasoning, code generation, and instruction following.

Conclusion: SparseLoRA effectively balances efficiency and performance, offering a practical solution for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the
number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease
computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this
paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning
through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD
sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss
and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address
sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results
show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a
measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various
downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code
generation, and instruction following.

*Zeyun Deng, Jasorsi Ghosh, Fiona Xie, Yuzhe Lu, Katia Sycara, Joseph Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an energy-based transfer learning method for reinforcement learning, using out-of-distribution detection to improve sample efficiency by selectively applying teacher guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning struggles with sample efficiency, especially in multi-task or continual learning. Transferring knowledge from a teacher policy can help but may be sub-optimal if tasks differ too much.

Method: Energy-based transfer learning with out-of-distribution detection to selectively apply teacher guidance in states within its training distribution.

Result: Theoretical proof that energy scores reflect teacher's state-visitation density; empirical improvements in sample efficiency and performance in single-task and multi-task settings.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves sample efficiency and performance by ensuring teacher guidance is only applied where appropriate.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency,
making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings.
Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained
teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the
new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred
guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors.
We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses
out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the
teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We
theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation
density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance
across both single-task and multi-task settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Crome (Causally Robust Reward Modeling) is introduced to mitigate reward hacking in reward models (RMs) by using causal and neutral augmentations during training, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often suffer from reward hacking by focusing on superficial attributes like response length instead of true quality drivers (e.g., factuality). Standard training fails to disentangle these factors, leading to misalignment.

Method: Crome employs synthetic targeted augmentations: (1) Causal Augmentations to enforce sensitivity to causal attributes, and (2) Neutral Augmentations to enforce invariance to spurious attributes. These are generated via answer interventions without prior knowledge of spurious factors.

Result: Crome outperforms baselines on RewardBench, improving average accuracy by up to 5.4%, with gains of 13.2% and 7.2% in specific categories. It also shows consistent robustness in Best-of-N inference across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Crome effectively mitigates reward hacking, enhancing RM robustness and alignment, as demonstrated by significant performance improvements across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to
latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or
formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for
the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs
because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors,
leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally
Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model
designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic
targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are
pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity
along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which
are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce
invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced
without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along
causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically,
Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving
average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in
specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the
consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N,
across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat,
chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and
the reasoning-specific GSM8k.

*Khiem Le, Tuan Tran, Ting Hua, Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAME is a federated learning framework using Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) to retain full LoRA matrices, addressing resource adaptability and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA federated fine-tuning methods suffer from performance loss due to compression. FLAME aims to avoid this by leveraging SMoE for better adaptability.

Method: FLAME uses SMoE to vary activated experts per client, with rescaling and activation-aware aggregation to handle output mismatch and expert imbalance.

Result: FLAME outperforms existing methods across diverse computational settings, proving its robustness.

Conclusion: FLAME provides an effective, resource-adaptive solution for federated learning without compromising performance.

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients
to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order
to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression
requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To
address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on
the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches,
FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side
adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However,
incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges,
specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation
and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles
these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an
activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse
computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing
methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive
federated learning.

*Bornali Phukon, Xiuwen Zheng, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new metric combining NLI scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity is proposed to better evaluate ASR intelligibility for dysarthric speech, outperforming traditional metrics like WER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ASR metrics (e.g., WER, CER) fail to capture intelligibility for dysarthric/dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment is more critical than exact word matches.

Method: Proposes a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity.

Result: The new metric achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments, surpassing traditional methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures in ASR evaluation, especially for dysarthric speech.

Abstract: Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility,
especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment
matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech
types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise
consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two
key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility,
and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR
transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores,
semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric
achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility
Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to
prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

TL;DR: A novel RL framework redefines agent-environment boundaries by treating distribution parameters as actions, enabling continuous action spaces. The DPPG method reduces gradient variance, and DPAC outperforms TD3 in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling diverse action types (discrete, continuous, mixed) in RL by reparameterizing actions as distribution parameters, simplifying the action space and improving learning efficiency.

Method: Introduces DPPG, a deterministic policy gradient estimator for distribution parameters, and ICL for critic learning. DPAC, a practical actor-critic algorithm, builds on TD3.

Result: DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo tasks and performs competitively in discretized action spaces.

Conclusion: The framework and DPAC algorithm effectively generalize RL to diverse action spaces, demonstrating superior performance in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats
distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and
environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous,
regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.).
Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy
gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has
lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although
learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we
introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy
to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on
TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical
DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC).
Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from
OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance
on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) to remove sensitive data from LLMs, addressing privacy and security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs memorize training data, posing privacy and security risks, especially with PII. Current unlearning methods are inadequate for LLMs.

Method: Applied RMU to unlearn sensitive info, analyzing effects across decoder layers to identify optimal regions for removal.

Result: RMU ranked 4th on leaderboards for both 1B and 7B parameter models.

Conclusion: RMU is effective for unlearning sensitive info in LLMs, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to
memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance,
and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable
Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to
mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due
to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive
Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive
information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of
unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective
regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the
official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled analysis of transformers' inductive biases, generalization, and entropy dynamics using operator-theoretic tools.

Method: Represent token embeddings and attention as self-adjoint operators in a free probability space, modeling attention as non-commutative convolution and layer propagation as free additive convolution.

Result: Reveals a spectral dynamical system in transformers, derives a free entropy-based generalization bound, and shows predictable spectral trace evolution with depth.

Conclusion: Bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling deeper understanding of information flow and complexity in large language models.

Abstract: We outline an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing transformer-based
language models using the tools of free probability theory. By representing
token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a racial
probability space, we reinterpret attention as a non-commutative convolution
and view the layer-wise propagation of representations as an evolution governed
by free additive convolution. This formalism reveals a spectral dynamical
system underpinning deep transformer stacks and offers insight into their
inductive biases, generalization behavior, and entropy dynamics. We derive a
generalization bound based on free entropy and demonstrate that the spectral
trace of transformer layers evolves predictably with depth. Our approach
bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling
principled analysis of information flow and structural complexity in large
language models

TL;DR: SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture using Slepian bases, outperforms traditional GNNs in representing and predicting spatiotemporal signal patterns on graphs, particularly in neuroscience and traffic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs and graph signal processing methods struggle to efficiently represent localized signal patterning on graphs, which is crucial in domains like neuroscience.

Method: SlepNet employs Slepian bases to optimally concentrate signal energy on relevant subgraphs, automatically learned with a mask, enabling canonical and high-resolution representations.

Result: SlepNet outperforms baselines in fMRI and traffic datasets, offering better resolution in distinguishing similar patterns and enabling downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SlepNet is effective for both prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data, providing superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on
graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of
graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing
patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in
subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience.
Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult
to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph
Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or
spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown
promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly
confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that
uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian
harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant
subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce
canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing
energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated
SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and
two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional
GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines
in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns
from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns,
and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here
we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for
other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both
for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEBIAS optimizes outcome definitions for causal inference in psychiatry, outperforming existing methods by addressing confounding through interpretable symptom aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference in psychiatry is challenged by symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding, which existing methods inadequately address due to fixed outcome assumptions.

Method: DEBIAS learns non-negative, interpretable weights for symptom aggregation to maximize causal identifiability and minimize confounding, leveraging prior treatment effects.

Result: DEBIAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for depression and schizophrenia, with verifiable unconfoundedness tests.

Conclusion: DEBIAS effectively addresses confounding in psychiatric longitudinal data by optimizing outcome definitions, offering a robust solution for causal inference.

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,
especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding
frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment
effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding
through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of
unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this
foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to
maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with
Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,
clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable
treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent
confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments
in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically
verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically
interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression
and schizophrenia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between graph machine learning and relational databases by introducing RDL, enabling representation learning without traditional feature engineering.

Method: Represent relational databases as relational entity graphs, review benchmark datasets, and survey GNN-based methods and architectural advances for RDL.

Result: Identifies key challenges (e.g., multi-table integration, temporal dynamics) and recent advances in RDL, proposing unification for foundation models.

Conclusion: RDL converges graph machine learning sub-fields, offering potential for foundation models to revolutionize relational data processing.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities
of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to
molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among
other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be
constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -
a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without
traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,
relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by
primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)
the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a
database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in
nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first
introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity
graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to
develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges
including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling
temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational
neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for
relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these
distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple
sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models
that can transform the processing of relational data.

Motivation: Traditional text processing methods struggle with multilingual and context-sensitive content, while LLMs are costly. SORE aims to bridge this gap.

Result: SORE outperforms structural methods and achieves near-LLM precision in HTML datasets, processing millions of documents daily.

Conclusion: SORE offers an efficient, accurate alternative to traditional and LLM-based methods, with released implementation for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modern text processing pipelines demand robust methods to remove extraneous
content while preserving a document's core message. Traditional approaches such
as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual
settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce
SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that
leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor
search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core
content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely
match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE
achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments
on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield
high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in
production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages
while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility
and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.

### [539] [A Minimalist Optimizer Design for LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16659)
*Athanasios Glentis, Jiaxiang Li, Andi Han, Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCALE, a new optimizer combining column-normalized SGD and last-layer momentum, matches or exceeds Adam's performance while using 35-45% less memory, outperforming other memory-efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the minimal optimizer state needed for state-of-the-art LLM pretraining performance and reduce memory consumption.

Method: Systematic investigation using a bottom-up approach, focusing on column-wise gradient normalization and first-order momentum for the output layer.

Result: SCALE matches or outperforms Adam and other memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., GaLore, Fira, APOLLO) in performance and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: SCALE is a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory constraints and serves as a minimalist baseline for future optimizer designs.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers
such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and
second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as
GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce
memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount
of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art
performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate
this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and
compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)
column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of
plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only
to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance
competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,
we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new
optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where
column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output
dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the
performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also
consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and
APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory
constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art
method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,
our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer
design.

### [540] [A Distributional-Lifting Theorem for PAC Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16651)
*Guy Blanc, Jane Lange, Carmen Strassle, Li-Yang Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributional-lifting theorem to upgrade learners limited to specific distributions to work with any distribution, improving efficiency and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of distribution-specific learning by enabling efficient learning for any distribution without strong access requirements.

Method: Prove a distributional-lifting theorem and develop a lifter that works in the standard PAC model, avoiding the need for conditional sample oracles.

Result: The new lifter is efficient, works for all base distributions, preserves noise tolerance, and improves sample complexity.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies and generalizes distribution-free learning, making it more practical and broadly applicable.

Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led
to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional
assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their
reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting
theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited
distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any
distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the
complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in
$\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of
lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a
conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded
by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from
semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information
to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with
access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their
use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that
sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the
standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base
distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better
sample complexity, and is simpler.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO) to overcome limitations of current functional generative models, expanding their applicability to diverse domains and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current functional generative models rely on Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), restricting them to regular grids and rectangular domains. This limits their broader scientific and engineering applications.

Method: MINO leverages graph neural operators and cross-attention mechanisms to create a domain- and discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.

Result: MINO significantly broadens the applicability of functional generative models, enabling diverse applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. It also integrates neural operators with advanced deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: The paper presents MINO as a principled solution to current limitations, introduces standardized evaluation metrics, and advances the field of functional generative modeling.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of
generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention
due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering
applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and
discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and
rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the
Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and
cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and
discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.
This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse
applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO
provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general
advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of
standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional
generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware weighting function for diffusion models in offline RL, improving training efficiency and stability with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in offline RL face high training costs and slow convergence, especially with transformer-based backbones, due to ineffective loss weighting functions.

Method: The authors derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function and propose a closed-form polynomial approximation method for online estimation.

Result: Experiments on Maze2D and Kitchen benchmarks show competitive performance with up to 10x fewer training steps.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances training efficiency and stability in diffusion-based offline RL, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these
methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence,
particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several
optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules,
auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain
in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss
weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can
be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity
of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this
work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function
and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online
estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our
method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline
RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our
method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training
steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

*Felix Zhou, Samson Zhou, Vahab Mirrokni, Alessandro Epasto, Vincent Cohen-Addad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for generating differentially private synthetic image embeddings using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) achieves SOTA classification accuracy and realistic image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in deep neural network training by preventing memorization of sensitive data through differential privacy (DP).

Method: Privately generate synthetic datasets by fitting a GMM in an embedding space using DP clustering.

Result: Achieves SOTA classification accuracy on benchmarks and generates realistic synthetic images.

Conclusion: The method is general, scalable, and effective for privacy-preserving deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often use large, high-quality datasets to achieve high
performance on many machine learning tasks. When training involves potentially
sensitive data, this process can raise privacy concerns, as large models have
been shown to unintentionally memorize and reveal sensitive information,
including reconstructing entire training samples. Differential privacy (DP)
provides a robust framework for protecting individual data and in particular, a
new approach to privately training deep neural networks is to approximate the
input dataset with a privately generated synthetic dataset, before any
subsequent training algorithm. We introduce a novel principled method for DP
synthetic image embedding generation, based on fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) in an appropriate embedding space using DP clustering. Our method
provably learns a GMM under separation conditions. Empirically, a simple
two-layer neural network trained on synthetically generated embeddings achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy on standard benchmark datasets.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can generate realistic synthetic
images that achieve downstream classification accuracy comparable to SOTA
methods. Our method is quite general, as the encoder and decoder modules can be
freely substituted to suit different tasks. It is also highly scalable,
consisting only of subroutines that scale linearly with the number of samples
and/or can be implemented efficiently in distributed systems.

*Yuping Yan, Yizhi Wang, Yuanshuai Li, Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TriCon-SF is a serial federated learning framework with triple shuffling and contribution awareness, enhancing privacy, robustness, and accountability in cross-silo settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy violations, gradient leakage, and malicious client behavior in serial pipeline training for federated learning, especially in healthcare.

Method: Integrates triple shuffling (model layers, data segments, training sequences) and Shapley value-based contribution evaluation.

Result: Outperforms standard federated learning in accuracy and communication efficiency on non-IID healthcare datasets, with proven resilience against attacks.

Conclusion: TriCon-SF effectively balances privacy, robustness, and efficiency in federated learning for sensitive domains.

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data
heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead.
However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models
between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to
gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against
semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models
remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial
federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution
awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling
model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic
learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing
privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to
dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the
detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive
experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF
outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy
and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience
against client-side privacy attacks.

*Dinesh Ramasamy, Shakti Kumar, Chris Cadonic, Jiaxin Yang, Sohini Roychowdhury, Esam Abdel Rhman, Srihari Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach using vector quantization (VQ) to create compact Semantic IDs (SIDs) for ad-recommendation systems, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling large-scale user histories in real-time ad-recommendation systems is challenging due to storage and inference costs.

Method: Introduces VQ fusion (multi-task VQ-VAE), SIDE (SID-to-embedding conversion), and DPCA (Discrete-PCA) for efficient SID generation.

Result: Achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy gain and 3X reduction in data footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances scalability and performance in industrial ad-recommendation systems.

Abstract: Sequence-based recommendations models are driving the state-of-the-art for
industrial ad-recommendation systems. Such systems typically deal with user
histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4)
events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained
models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due
to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we
propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a
compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a
collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by
introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ
fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into
a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding
conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding
collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup
table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which
generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed
enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system
achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in
data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.

*Fanchen Bu, Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a misalignment between training and testing in unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO) and proposes a preliminary idea to align them by integrating differentiable derandomization into training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCO methods suffer from a misalignment where lower training losses don't guarantee better post-derandomization performance, even without data distribution shifts.

Method: The paper explores integrating a differentiable version of derandomization into the training process to align training and testing phases.

Result: Empirical results show improved alignment but also introduce new training challenges.

Conclusion: The preliminary idea improves training-test alignment but reveals nontrivial training challenges, suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims
to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for
each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete
and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance,
starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to
obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and
more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical
performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a
misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods.
Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better
post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any
data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases.
We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by
including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our
empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test
alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

*Cynthia Dwork, Lunjia Hu, Han Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the domain shattering dimension to quantify the number of domains needed for domain generalization, linking it to VC dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how many domains are required to learn a model that generalizes well across seen and unseen domains.

Method: Model the problem in the PAC framework and propose the domain shattering dimension as a combinatorial measure.

Result: The domain shattering dimension characterizes domain sample complexity and relates to VC dimension, showing PAC-learnable classes remain learnable.

Conclusion: The domain shattering dimension provides a theoretical foundation for domain generalization, bridging it with classic learning theory.

Abstract: We study a fundamental question of domain generalization: given a family of
domains (i.e., data distributions), how many randomly sampled domains do we
need to collect data from in order to learn a model that performs reasonably
well on every seen and unseen domain in the family? We model this problem in
the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the
domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the
domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative
relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC
dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the
standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel off-policy RL method for adversarial robustness by reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization, eliminating extra environmental interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and dependencies in existing adversarial RL methods, which hinder off-policy development.

Method: Reformulates adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization, leveraging symmetric policy evaluation.

Result: Theoretically supported method that avoids additional environmental interactions.

Conclusion: Offers a practical and efficient solution for adversarial RL with potential for broader off-policy applications.

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle
adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated
by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated
reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons
requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and
training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this
process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary,
making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the
development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy
method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by
reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.
Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy
evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available
at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimistic Fictitious Play achieves constant regret in two-strategy zero-sum games without regularization, outperforming Alternating Fictitious Play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether non-no-regret algorithms like Optimistic Fictitious Play can achieve fast learning rates in games, similar to regularized methods.

Method: Analyzes Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of payoff vectors, using a geometric proof technique to show bounded energy of iterates.

Result: Optimistic Fictitious Play achieves constant regret, while Alternating Fictitious Play has a regret lower bound of Œ©(‚àöT).

Conclusion: Optimism enables faster learning (constant regret) compared to alternation in unregularized settings, highlighting its potential for efficient game learning.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in
two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a
regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant
regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates
are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games
that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only
constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of
non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique
leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of
payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains
bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized
regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving
$o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

*Jongmin Park, Seunghoon Han, Won-Yong Shin, Sungsu Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MHCL uses multiple hyperbolic spaces and contrastive learning to better capture diverse power-law structures in heterogeneous graphs, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding models use a single hyperbolic space, failing to capture diverse power-law structures.

Method: Proposes MHCL, leveraging multiple hyperbolic spaces and contrastive learning to preserve semantic discriminability of metapath embeddings.

Result: MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in graph machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: MHCL effectively captures complex structures in heterogeneous graphs by using multiple hyperbolic spaces and contrastive learning.

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and
exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of
heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess
diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding
models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively
capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To
address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive
Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture
diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by
learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex
structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic
information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic
information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating
them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning
approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath
embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the
distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance
between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the
separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The
experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the
complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal fusion for decoding hand gestures using biosignals, comparing linear and attention-based strategies. The Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion outperformed others, with cross-modal interactions contributing significantly to decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding neuromuscular signatures of hand gestures is crucial for neuroscience and assistive technologies, but traditional methods rely on single biosignal modalities. Multimodal fusion can leverage complementary sensor data.

Method: The study compares linear and attention-based fusion strategies across three architectures (Multimodal MLP, Multimodal Transformer, Hierarchical Transformer) using datasets NinaPro DB2 and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture. An Isolation Network analyzes modality interactions.

Result: The Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming baselines by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7% on HD-sEMG. Cross-modal interactions contributed ~30% to decisions.

Conclusion: Attention-driven multimodal fusion enhances biosignal classification, providing insights into human muscle activities. The findings aid in designing sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the
decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic
neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional
human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but
multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We
systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across
three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a
Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and
multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2
(sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force).
Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion
consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best
single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7%
on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation
Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways,
quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream
decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute
approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers,
highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing
complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and
how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides
mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial
in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the focus on distributive equality in fair-ML research, advocating for a broader egalitarian framework that addresses both allocative and representational harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fair-ML research primarily relies on distributive equality, which inadequately addresses representational harms and structural inequality. The paper seeks a more comprehensive ethical foundation.

Method: The paper proposes a multifaceted egalitarian framework integrating distributive and relational equality, drawing on critical social and political philosophy.

Result: The framework provides a more holistic approach to ML fairness, addressing both allocative and representational harms, and suggests practical implementation pathways.

Conclusion: A broader egalitarian approach is necessary for ML fairness to tackle structural inequality and foster relational equality, offering a more complete ethical foundation.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of
research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And
why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly
appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,
such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally
distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because
they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive
focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading
ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that
equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging
structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that
privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality
manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,
economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While
distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why
representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce
social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --
and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals
(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a
multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both
distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political
philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for
tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also
outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML
pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck of parameter redundancy in LoRA, which limits its capacity and efficiency.

Method: Introduces SeLoRA, which re-parameterizes LoRA using spectral bases from a sparse spectral subspace.

Result: SeLoRA achieves greater efficiency with fewer parameters and outperforms baselines on tasks like reasoning and code generation.

Conclusion: SeLoRA is a scalable, plug-and-play framework that enhances LoRA's performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large foundation models. Despite its successes, the substantial
parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has
been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate
the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density
redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce
\underline{S}pectral-\underline{e}ncoding \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank
\underline{A}daptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of
spectral bases to re-parameterize LoRA from a sparse spectral subspace.
Designed with simplicity, SeLoRA enables seamless integration with various LoRA
variants for performance boosting, serving as a scalable plug-and-play
framework. Extensive experiments substantiate that SeLoRA achieves greater
efficiency with fewer parameters, delivering superior performance enhancements
over strong baselines on various downstream tasks, including commonsense
reasoning, math reasoning, and code generation.

TL;DR: TabArena introduces a continuously maintained benchmarking system for tabular data, addressing flaws in static benchmarks by curating datasets, models, and a public leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for tabular data are static and outdated, failing to adapt to new models or discovered flaws.

Method: TabArena manually curates datasets and models, conducts large-scale benchmarking, and establishes a maintenance team.

Result: Gradient-boosted trees remain strong, deep learning catches up with ensembling, and foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Ensembles advance state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: TabArena provides a living benchmark with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for
tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than
ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even
if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are
released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously
maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually
curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models,
conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard,
and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the
influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations
to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are
still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep
learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At
the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show
that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine
learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch
TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance
protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

### [555] [Exploring and Improving Initialization for Deep Graph Neural Networks: A Signal Propagation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16790)
*Senmiao Wang, Yupeng Chen, Yushun Zhang, Ruoyu Sun, Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPoGInit, a method to improve signal propagation in deep GNNs by optimizing initialization variances for three key metrics, addressing performance degradation with depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases, prompting the need for better initialization methods to enhance signal propagation.

Method: Proposes SPoGInit, which optimizes weight initialization variances for forward/backward propagation and graph embedding variation (GEV) to improve signal propagation in deep GNNs.

Result: SPoGInit outperforms common initialization methods, enabling performance improvements as GNNs deepen.

Conclusion: SPoGInit effectively addresses depth-related challenges in GNNs, validating the SP analysis framework.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from performance degradation as the
network depth increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing
initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We
propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation,
backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two
metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for
GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used
initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with
increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal
with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for
weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to
significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal
Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments
demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on
various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance
improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in
addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and
effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.

*Kai Yang, Shaoyu Dou, Pan Luo, Xin Wang, H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a seq2GMM framework for detecting unusual quasi-periodic time series in networks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify anomalous time series in networks with quasi-periodic signals and provide interpretable decisions.

Method: Develops a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model (seq2GMM) and a surrogate-based optimization algorithm for training.

Result: Seq2GMM outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for anomaly detection, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of
physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The
quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar
repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in
different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude
of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to
identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the
observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how
the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model
(seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify
unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We
further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently
train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a
plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the
convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical
results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs are used to extract main concepts from materials science abstracts, building a concept graph to predict new research ideas, outperforming keyword methods and inspiring scientists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The overwhelming volume of research publications makes it impossible for scientists to read everything, necessitating automated methods to extract and link concepts.

Method: LLMs extract semantic information to build a concept graph; a machine learning model predicts emerging concept combinations based on historical data.

Result: LLMs outperform keyword extraction, and integrating semantic information improves prediction performance, inspiring scientists with novel topic combinations.

Conclusion: The model effectively aids materials scientists by predicting innovative research directions, demonstrating the value of LLMs in literature analysis.

Abstract: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is
impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within
their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large
language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and
semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials
science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest
inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can
extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to
build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine
learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e.
new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating
semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The
applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with
domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the
model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by
predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been
investigated.

### [558] [Bandwidth Selectors on Semiparametric Bayesian Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16844)
*Victor Alejandre, Concha Bielza, Pedro Larra√±aga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates advanced bandwidth selectors for Semiparametric Bayesian Networks (SPBNs), showing they outperform the traditional normal rule, especially in high sample size scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often deviates from normality, making the normal rule for bandwidth selection in SPBNs suboptimal. This paper aims to improve density estimation and predictive performance by exploring better bandwidth selectors.

Method: The paper applies cross-validation and plug-in selectors for bandwidth selection in SPBNs, extending the PyBNesian package with these techniques. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are conducted.

Result: Unbiased cross-validation outperforms the normal rule, especially with larger datasets, leveraging information more effectively.

Conclusion: Advanced bandwidth selectors enhance SPBN performance, with cross-validation being particularly effective for high sample sizes.

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and
non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex
data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators
(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of
data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the
KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the
trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates
from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and
reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical
framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and
subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the
approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their
effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.
To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package
PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and
conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively
than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.
In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,
highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

*Zeyneddin Oz, Shreyas Korde, Marius Bock, Kristof Van Laerhoven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedFitTech, a baseline for Federated Learning (FL) in wearable fitness tracking (FitTech), addressing privacy and efficiency challenges. It reduces communication redundancy by 13% with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized learning for fitness activity detection faces privacy, regulatory, and communication issues. FL offers a decentralized alternative but poses challenges like data imbalance and personalization-generalization trade-offs.

Method: The authors propose FedFitTech under the Flower framework, featuring client-side early stopping and a case study to demonstrate its application.

Result: FedFitTech reduces redundant communications by 13% while maintaining recognition performance with only a 1% cost.

Conclusion: FedFitTech provides a scalable, efficient, and privacy-aware solution for FitTech, fostering new research opportunities. It is open-source and available for use.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models
have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices.
Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical
movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports
optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning
approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns,
regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast,
Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating
model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech
presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data,
heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization
and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the
FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available
and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to
illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system
based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping
strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable
devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity
patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the
scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications.
Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent,
while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible
recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation
for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and
it is available as open-source at:

### [560] [The Importance of Being Lazy: Scaling Limits of Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16884)
*Jacopo Graldi, Alessandro Breccia, Giulia Lanzillotta, Thomas Hofmann, Lorenzo Noci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how model scale and feature learning impact continual learning, reconciling contradictory findings by distinguishing between lazy and rich training regimes. It shows that wider models reduce feature learning, mitigating catastrophic forgetting (CF), and identifies a critical feature learning level for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand catastrophic forgetting in continual learning and reconcile conflicting observations about the role of model scale and feature learning.

Method: Uses variable parameterization to differentiate lazy and rich training regimes, analyzes infinite width dynamics with dynamical mean field theory, and studies the relationship between feature learning, task similarity, and forgetting.

Result: Wider models reduce feature learning (laziness), mitigating CF. High feature learning benefits only highly similar tasks, with a transition between lazy and rich regimes. Optimal performance occurs at a critical feature learning level.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified perspective on scale and feature learning in continual learning, highlighting the importance of balancing feature learning and task non-stationarity to minimize forgetting.

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in
non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting
(CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the
impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning.
We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by
differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable
parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is
only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more
laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the
infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and
characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy
regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task
non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only
beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by
task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low
forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our
findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical
level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers
across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of
scale and feature learning in continual learning.

### [561] [Soft decision trees for survival analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16846)
*Antonio Consoloa, Edoardo Amaldi, Emilio Carrizosa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a soft survival tree (SST) model with soft splitting rules, trained via nonlinear optimization, outperforming benchmarks in survival analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve survival tree models by combining interpretability with global optimization and flexibility in survival function estimation.

Method: Proposes SST with soft splitting rules, trained via nonlinear optimization and decomposition, supporting various survival functions (parametric, semiparametric, nonparametric).

Result: SSTs outperform three benchmark survival trees on 15 datasets in discrimination and calibration measures.

Conclusion: SSTs offer a flexible, interpretable, and high-performing approach to survival analysis, with potential for fairness extensions.

Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability
and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the
timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built
through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in
globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the
error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree
model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a
nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs
provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a
single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit
the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with
interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or
nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf
node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are
associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15
well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based
semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the
node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft
regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four
widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended
to consider group fairness.

### [562] [Reward-Agnostic Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16853)
*Semin Kim, Yeonwoo Cha, Jaehoon Yoo, Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RATTPO is a reward-agnostic method for optimizing prompts in text-to-image models, outperforming specialized approaches in efficiency and adaptability across diverse reward scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt engineering methods are tailored to specific rewards, limiting their adaptability to new scenarios. RATTPO aims to address this by being universally applicable.

Method: RATTPO iteratively refines prompts using LLMs, leveraging optimization trajectories and reward-aware hints without requiring reward-specific task descriptions.

Result: RATTPO improves prompts across diverse rewards (e.g., aesthetics, human preference) and is more efficient, using up to 3.5x fewer resources than baselines.

Conclusion: RATTPO is a versatile and efficient solution for prompt optimization, matching or surpassing specialized methods without reward-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image
(T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function
specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating
image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically
target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs
exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios
involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce
RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time
optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without
modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying
large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task
descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel
reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results
demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts
across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as
aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects.
RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using
up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget,
achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require
reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at

*Shaoyu Dou, Kai Yang, Yang Jiao, Chengbo Qiu, Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised learning framework for measuring similarities in event-triggered time series, combining hierarchical autoencoders and GMM for improved performance in security tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of selecting appropriate similarity metrics for security-related time series analysis, such as anomaly detection and clustering, drives the need for an unsupervised framework.

Method: The framework uses hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn low-dimensional representations of time series.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic approach for modeling and learning similarities in event-triggered time series, with potential applications in cyber security.

Abstract: Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as
intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among
multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for
downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the
event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric
is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised
learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of
event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the
proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution
sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively
learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the
obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The
proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a
systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of
event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods considerably.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning (XGBoost, random forest) and deep learning (LSTM) to predict neonatal mortality, with LSTM achieving 99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neonatal death remains a global issue; early prediction can save lives by enabling timely care.

Method: Used historical data of 1.4M newborns to train models like logistic regression, KNN, random forest, XGBoost, CNN, and LSTM.

Result: XGBoost and random forest achieved 94% accuracy; LSTM outperformed with 99%.

Conclusion: LSTM is the most effective for predicting neonatal mortality and guiding precautionary measures.

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some
developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000
births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction
of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to
take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be
avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a
newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4
million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such
as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate
model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,
XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while
among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.
Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict
whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

*Qian Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework to determine the optimal depth of neural networks by modeling the forward pass as an optimal stopping problem, proving finite stopping depth under diminishing returns, and proposing a practical regularization term for early exiting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of determining neural network depth through costly experimentation motivates a formal theoretical approach to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: The forward pass of a ResNet is recast as an optimal stopping problem, with a proof of finite stopping depth under diminishing returns. A regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm depth}$, is proposed to encourage early exiting.

Result: Empirical validation on ImageNet shows the regularizer improves computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, sometimes even enhancing it.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled way to optimize network depth, with practical benefits demonstrated in computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet
challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive
experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to
address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network,
specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We
model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential
decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting
computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a
potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the
intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary
theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of
diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping
depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this
insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to
efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by
extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to
continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on
ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically
predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency
without compromising, and in some cases improving, final model accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable Lomb-Scargle layer is introduced for computing power spectra of irregularly sampled data, integrated into a score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for accurate time series imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in machine learning posed by missing or irregularly sampled time series data, avoiding distortions from interpolation required by FFT.

Method: Proposes a differentiable Lomb-Scargle layer for spectral computation and integrates it into a score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for imputation.

Result: Outperforms time-domain baselines in accuracy for missing data recovery and provides consistent frequency estimates.

Conclusion: The method enables spectral guidance in machine learning for incomplete or irregular data, with potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent
challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain,
relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling,
therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that
enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled
data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD)
for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method
recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while
simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method
can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of
spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or
irregular data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in unsupervised machine learning for detecting quality-related issues in industrial production, focusing on robustness and practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection is costly and error-prone; unsupervised ML can improve efficiency but struggles with low data quality and robustness in real-world settings.

Method: Evaluates two state-of-the-art models for anomaly detection on low-quality RGB images of blasted forged metal parts, focusing on robustness and invariance.

Result: Identifies common pitfalls in likelihood-based approaches and proposes a framework for better empirical risk estimation in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides practical guardrails for practitioners to improve model and data quality in industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

*Joshua Schraven, Alexander Windmann, Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAWIFlow is a realistic flow-based benchmark for network intrusion detection, derived from MAWILab v1.1, addressing limitations of synthetic datasets. It includes temporally distinct samples and evaluates traditional and deep learning methods, showing CNN-BiLSTM's superior generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic datasets lack statistical variability and temporal drift, limiting realistic evaluation of anomaly detection methods.

Method: MAWIFlow transforms raw packet captures into flow representations (CICFlowMeter format) with preserved anomaly labels. Traditional ML and CNN-BiLSTM models are compared.

Result: Tree-based models degrade over time, while CNN-BiLSTM maintains performance, highlighting the need for realistic datasets with temporal structure.

Conclusion: Realistic benchmarks like MAWIFlow are crucial for evaluating anomaly detection methods. Publicly available datasets and code promote transparency.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on
synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical
variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This
paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1
dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly
detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that
transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the
CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The
resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011,
2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods,
including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are
compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical
results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally
static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In
contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing
improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic

### [569] [RocketStack: A level-aware deep recursive ensemble learning framework with exploratory feature fusion and model pruning dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16965)
*√áaƒüatay Demirel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RocketStack introduces a level-aware recursive ensemble framework for deep stacking, addressing complexity and redundancy through pruning, noise, and feature compression, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like model complexity, feature redundancy, and computational burden in deep stacking, RocketStack aims to enable deeper ensemble learning with tractable complexity.

Method: The framework uses incremental pruning of weaker learners, mild Gaussian noise on OOF scores, and feature compression (attention-based, SFE filter, autoencoders) to stabilize and optimize performance.

Result: RocketStack achieved 97.08% accuracy (binary) and 98.60% (multi-class) at level 10, outperforming baselines by 5.14% and 6.11%, respectively, while reducing runtime and feature dimensionality.

Conclusion: Mild randomization and periodic compression are effective for deep recursive ensembling, making RocketStack a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking
used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model.
However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal
diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and
computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware
recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking
levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally
prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without
excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian
noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against
strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions
are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE)
filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class),
linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and
the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the
strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild
OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the
strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no
compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached
98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing
runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.
These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and
periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets
in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive
ensembling with tractable complexity.

*Abdellah Rahmani, Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FANTOM is a framework for causal discovery in non-stationary, non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic multivariate time series, identifying regimes and their causal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address non-stationarity and complex noise in time series, limiting causal analysis.

Method: FANTOM uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm to infer regimes and their Directed Acyclic Graphs.

Result: Theoretical identifiability is proven, and experiments show FANTOM outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: FANTOM effectively handles non-stationary, complex-noise time series, advancing causal discovery.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in
many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many
such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments
with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal
structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for
analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this
setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have
its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,
which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery
approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity
or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified
framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with
non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the
number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's
Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm
that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the
theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal
heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are
identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,
extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms
existing methods.

*Marco Jiralerspong, Esther Derman, Danilo Vucetic, Nikolay Malkin, Bilun Sun, Tianyu Zhang, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Gauthier Gidel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of narrowing large combinatorial sets in scientific discovery by improving reinforcement learning methods to handle uncertain proxy rewards, introducing a robust RL operator for better candidate generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for filtering combinatorial sets (e.g., proteins, molecules) rely on uncertain proxy rewards, leading to suboptimal candidate selection, especially in large search spaces.

Method: The authors propose a robust RL approach with a unified operator to handle reward uncertainty, aiming for peakier sampling distributions and encompassing soft RL operators.

Result: The introduced algorithm outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality, diverse candidates in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a flexible, robust framework for discrete compositional generation tasks, enhancing scientific discovery.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scientific discovery involves narrowing a large
combinatorial set of objects, such as proteins or molecules, to a small set of
promising candidates. While this process largely relies on expert knowledge,
recent methods leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance this filtering.
They achieve this by estimating proxy reward functions from available datasets
and using regularization to generate more diverse candidates. These reward
functions are inherently uncertain, raising a particularly salient challenge
for scientific discovery. In this work, we show that existing methods, often
framed as sampling proportional to a reward function, are inadequate and yield
suboptimal candidates, especially in large search spaces. To remedy this issue,
we take a robust RL approach and introduce a unified operator that seeks
robustness to the uncertainty of the proxy reward function. This general
operator targets peakier sampling distributions while encompassing known soft
RL operators. It also leads us to a novel algorithm that identifies
higher-quality, diverse candidates in both synthetic and real-world tasks.
Ultimately, our work offers a new, flexible perspective on discrete
compositional generation tasks. Code: https://github.com/marcojira/tgm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new MARL framework, MARL-OD-DA, improves scalability and reliability for traffic assignment by redefining agents as OD pair routers and using a Dirichlet-based action space with pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and reliability challenges of MARL in large-scale traffic assignment problems.

Method: Introduces MARL-OD-DA with OD pair routers, Dirichlet-based action space, action pruning, and a local relative gap reward function.

Result: Outperforms existing MARL methods, achieving a 94.99% lower relative gap in the SiouxFalls network.

Conclusion: MARL-OD-DA is effective for medium-sized networks with varied city-level OD demand, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands
impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in
modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,
which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face
challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with
substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in
solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,
this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic
assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair
routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.
Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward
function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution
reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with
extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.
When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better
assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than
that of conventional methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the identifiability of deep Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs), revealing how activation degrees and layer widths affect identifiability, with specific results for non-increasing and encoder-decoder architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the identifiability of PNNs is crucial for their interpretability, but this property remains poorly understood.

Method: The study connects deep PNNs to low-rank tensor decompositions and uses Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems to analyze identifiability.

Result: Non-increasing layer widths and certain decoder width conditions ensure identifiability. The paper also resolves a conjecture on neurovarieties' dimensions and provides bounds on activation degrees.

Conclusion: The work offers comprehensive insights into PNN identifiability, with constructive proofs and practical conditions for achieving it.

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection
between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type
uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the
architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.
We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's
neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for
it to reach its maximum.

TL;DR: A scoping review identified 62 fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI, revealing fragmentation, limited validation, and gaps in clinical relevance and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear definition of fairness in AI and its risks of perpetuating biases in clinical practice.

Method: Conducted a scoping review of five databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records to include 41 studies and extract 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric.

Result: Found a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation, overreliance on threshold-dependent measures, and only one clinical utility metric among 18 healthcare-specific metrics.

Conclusion: Highlights conceptual challenges in fairness definition and gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and real-world applicability, urging prioritization of clinically meaningful metrics.

Abstract: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve
clinical practice and patient outcomes, but risks perpetuating biases if
fairness is inadequately addressed. However, the definition of "fairness"
remains unclear. We conducted a scoping review to identify and critically
appraise fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI. We defined a "fairness
metric" as a measure quantifying whether a model discriminates (societally)
against individuals or groups defined by sensitive attributes. We searched five
databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records, to include 41 studies, and
extracted 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by
performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric,
revealing a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation and
overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Eighteen metrics were explicitly
developed for healthcare, including only one clinical utility metric. Our
findings highlight conceptual challenges in defining and quantifying fairness
and identify gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and
real-world applicability. Future work should prioritise clinically meaningful
metrics.

*Haolin Liu, Adrien Siproudhis, Samuel Experton, Peter Lorenz, Christina Boura, Thomas Peyrin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper refines neural network signature extraction, addressing limitations of prior methods to enable deeper network extraction with higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network model extraction is a security concern, but prior methods like Carlini et al.'s suffer from limitations (e.g., rank deficiency, noise propagation) restricting their applicability to shallow networks.

Method: The authors systematically identify and address these limitations, proposing efficient algorithmic solutions to improve signature extraction for deeper networks.

Result: Experiments on ReLU-based networks show significant improvements, with successful extraction of eight layers (95% accuracy on CIFAR-10), surpassing prior work's three-layer limit.

Conclusion: The refined method advances practical attacks on deeper and more complex neural networks, marking a crucial step in neural network security research.

Abstract: Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important
security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via
black-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which
aims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer.
Prior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired
by differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However,
their method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability
to networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign
extraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction
itself was feasible.
  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by
systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical
limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations
include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome
these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the
identified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction.
Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously
possible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based
neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and
accuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at
least 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the
first three layers. Our results represent a crucial step toward practical
attacks on larger and more complex neural network architectures.

*Botao Zhu, Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust evaluation framework (SRCTE) for collaborative systems, using ACFGs and a Siamese model to assess trustworthiness dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust evaluation in collaborative systems is challenging due to distributed devices, dynamic environments, and changing resources.

Method: Uses ACFGs to represent trust-related data and a Siamese model (Structure2vec networks) to compare embeddings for trust evaluation.

Result: SRCTE converges quickly with minimal data and achieves high anomaly detection rates compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The SRCTE framework effectively addresses dynamic trust evaluation in collaborative systems.

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of
collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and
continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task
execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex
operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust
evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,
the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a
trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and
represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures
trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison
with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,
the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as
task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with
an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,
consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to
learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.
Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is
calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A
real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to
test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and
achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline
algorithm.

TL;DR: Diffusion models trained on equilibrium molecular distributions show inconsistencies in generated samples and forces, especially at small timesteps. A new energy-based model with Fokker-Planck regularization improves consistency and sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistencies in diffusion models for molecular dynamics, particularly at small timesteps, where they fail to satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation.

Method: Propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on toy systems and alanine dipeptide, introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances consistency and sampling efficiency, addressing limitations of classical diffusion inference.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a
state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports
simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

TL;DR: The paper explores offline RL with small datasets, introduces 'Sparse-Reg' to prevent overfitting, and shows improved performance in limited data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many offline RL applications use small datasets, but existing benchmarks focus on large datasets, leading to overfitting issues.

Method: Introduces 'Sparse-Reg', a sparsity-based regularization technique for offline RL.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse-Reg effectively mitigates overfitting in small dataset offline RL, enabling better performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the apparent differences in generative model architectures and training methods by identifying their shared underlying principle.

Method: Analyzes various generative models (autoencoders, autoregressive models, GANs, normalizing flows, diffusion models, flow matching) as transformations of simple distributions into complex data distributions.

Result: Demonstrates that all these models fundamentally perform probability transformations, enabling methodological cross-pollination.

Conclusion: This unified perspective supports theoretical advancements and more efficient generative modeling techniques.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep
generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent
differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of
generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial
networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we
demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple
predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying
perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between
model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal
theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective
generative modeling techniques.

*Guozheng Ma, Lu Li, Zilin Wang, Li Shen, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing static network sparsity via one-shot random pruning improves scaling in deep reinforcement learning, outperforming dense networks in efficiency and optimization resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling deep reinforcement learning is challenging due to training pathologies, prompting the need for simpler solutions beyond complex interventions.

Method: One-shot random pruning removes a fixed percentage of network weights before training, creating sparse networks.

Result: Sparse networks achieve higher parameter efficiency and better resistance to optimization issues like plasticity loss and gradient interference.

Conclusion: Network sparsity is a simple yet effective method to enhance scaling in deep reinforcement learning, with consistent benefits across various scenarios.

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven
notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating
various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural
advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex
modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can
unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with
state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random
pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly
removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively
scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher
parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to
optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We
further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios,
demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

*Yuli Slavutsky, Ozgur Beker, David Blei, Bianca Dumitrascu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCoVeR is a new variational framework for disentangling condition-invariant and condition-specific factors in data, improving generalization in multi-condition settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address leakage in latent representations of existing VAE extensions, which limits generalization to unseen conditions in domains like biomedical data analysis.

Method: Introduces DISCoVeR with a dual-latent architecture, parallel reconstructions, and a max-min objective for clean separation without handcrafted priors.

Result: Achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data.

Conclusion: DISCoVeR is a principled approach for learning disentangled representations in multi-condition settings.

Abstract: Disentangled representations enable models to separate factors of variation
that are shared across experimental conditions from those that are
condition-specific. This separation is essential in domains such as biomedical
data analysis, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species
depends on isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects.
While extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework have been
proposed to address this problem, they frequently suffer from leakage between
latent representations, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen
conditions. Here, we introduce DISCoVeR, a new variational framework that
explicitly separates condition-invariant and condition-specific factors.
DISCoVeR integrates three key components: (i) a dual-latent architecture that
models shared and specific factors separately; (ii) two parallel
reconstructions that ensure both representations remain informative; and (iii)
a novel max-min objective that encourages clean separation without relying on
handcrafted priors, while making only minimal assumptions. Theoretically, we
show that this objective maximizes data likelihood while promoting
disentanglement, and that it admits a unique equilibrium. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DISCoVeR achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic
datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Together, these results
establish DISCoVeR as a principled approach for learning disentangled
representations in multi-condition settings.

TL;DR: RLIF (Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback) uses intrinsic signals like token-level entropy to improve LLM reasoning, matching RLVR early but degrading later, especially for instruction-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternatives to externally supervised RL methods (RLHF, RLVR) by leveraging intrinsic model-derived signals for LLM post-training.

Method: Proposes RLIF, using unsupervised reward proxies (token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, self-certainty) and evaluates on math reasoning benchmarks.

Result: RLIF boosts reasoning early but degrades later, underperforming pre-training levels. It shows minimal improvement for instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: RLIF has early promise but limitations, suggesting careful integration of internal feedback signals for effective LLM post-training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training
large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require
extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,
Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on
intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we
leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,
trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows
these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate
various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs
at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques
on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even
below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little
improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of
intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze
this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's
training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal
feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback
will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the implicit bias in over-parameterized linear regression, identifying the optimal bias for best generalization performance under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the implicit bias that yields the best generalization performance in over-parameterized learning problems.

Method: Asymptotic analysis of generalization performance for interpolators from convex potential minimization in non-isotropic Gaussian data settings.

Result: A tight lower bound on the best generalization error is derived, and the optimal convex implicit bias achieving this bound is identified under log-concavity conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the optimal implicit bias for generalization in over-parameterized linear regression, with potential applications in improving learning algorithms.

Abstract: Most modern learning problems are over-parameterized, where the number of
learnable parameters is much greater than the number of training data points.
In this over-parameterized regime, the training loss typically has infinitely
many global optima that completely interpolate the data with varying
generalization performance. The particular global optimum we converge to
depends on the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm. The question we
address in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best
generalization performance?". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a
precise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators
obtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for
over-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In
particular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error
possible among this class of interpolators in terms of the
over-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the
eigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the
parameter to be estimated. Finally, we find the optimal convex implicit bias
that achieves this lower bound under certain sufficient conditions involving
the log-concavity of the distribution of a Gaussian convolved with the prior of
the true underlying parameter.

*Xuechen Zhang, Zijian Huang, Yingcong Li, Chenshun Ni, Jiasi Chen, Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREAD, a GRPO variant, improves small language model reasoning by unifying SFT and RL stages with expert guidance and branched rollouts, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) struggle with complex reasoning due to limitations in the SFT + RL paradigm, especially when expert traces are hard to express or initialization is poor.

Method: Introduces BREAD, which combines SFT and RL via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts, inserting expert hints when self-generated traces fail.

Result: BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, outperforms GRPO, speeds up training by 3x, and solves problems unsolvable by SFT + RL.

Conclusion: BREAD's branched rollouts and expert guidance significantly enhance SLM reasoning, overcoming fundamental limitations of the SFT + RL approach.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors,
especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The
standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often
to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning
(RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose
methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate
that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are
too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's
initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these,
we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via
partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail,
BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model
to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update
includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the
reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer
than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while
speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that
BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT +
RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can
substantially boost SLM reasoning.

*Yinuo Ren, Tesi Xiao, Michael Shavlovsky, Lexing Ying, Holakou Rahmanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces COS-DPO, a framework for Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) in LLM alignment and ML tasks, extending Direct Preference Optimization to handle multiple objectives efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of fine-tuning models with datasets labeled for different objectives simultaneously (MOFT problem).

Method: Proposes Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning (COS-DPO), including Weight-COS-DPO for Pareto front profiling and Temperature-COS-DPO for flexible trade-off control.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in tasks like Learning-to-Rank and LLM alignment, showing viability for large-scale ML.

Conclusion: COS-DPO provides efficient and flexible solutions for MOFT, enhancing post-training trade-off control.

Abstract: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the
Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e., fine-tuning an existing model
with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address
the challenge, we propose a Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning framework
(COS-DPO) that extends the Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally
developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the
MOFT settings. By direct conditioning on the weight across auxiliary
objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient one-shot training
process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving
comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our
theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss
function, we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the
temperature parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of
post-training control over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary
objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO
framework through its applications to various tasks, including the
Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting its viability for
large-scale ML deployments.

*Peter Shaw, James Cohan, Jacob Eisenstein, Kenton Lee, Jonathan Berant, Kristina Toutanova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALTA is a new programming language and compiler that maps programs to Transformer weights, extending prior work by supporting loops and Universal Transformers. It demonstrates Transformer capabilities for tasks like parity, addition, and SCAN, and introduces tools for analyzing training failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the expressiveness of Transformer programming languages (like RASP and Tracr) by supporting loops and Universal Transformers, and to provide tools for analyzing algorithm learnability.

Method: ALTA is designed as a programming language with a compiler to Transformer weights. It includes symbolic interpretation and tools for training from execution traces.

Result: ALTA successfully compiles programs for tasks like parity, addition, and SCAN without scratchpad decoding. It also enables analysis of training failures and learnability.

Conclusion: ALTA advances Transformer programming by supporting more complex algorithms and providing tools for deeper analysis. The framework is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: We propose a new programming language called ALTA and a compiler that can map
ALTA programs to Transformer weights. ALTA is inspired by RASP, a language
proposed by Weiss et al. (2021), and Tracr (Lindner et al., 2023), a compiler
from RASP programs to Transformer weights. ALTA complements and extends this
prior work, offering the ability to express loops and to compile programs to
Universal Transformers, among other advantages. ALTA allows us to
constructively show how Transformers can represent length-invariant algorithms
for computing parity and addition, as well as a solution to the SCAN benchmark
of compositional generalization tasks, without requiring intermediate
scratchpad decoding steps. We also propose tools to analyze cases where the
expressibility of an algorithm is established, but end-to-end training on a
given training set fails to induce behavior consistent with the desired
algorithm. To this end, we explore training from ALTA execution traces as a
more fine-grained supervision signal. This enables additional experiments and
theoretical analyses relating the learnability of various algorithms to data
availability and modeling decisions, such as positional encodings. We make the
ALTA framework -- language specification, symbolic interpreter, and weight
compiler -- available to the community to enable further applications and
insights.

TL;DR: AWL fine-tuning method improves LLMs by combining knowledge learning and adaptive tool usage, boosting accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLMs' hallucination and overreliance on tools by mimicking human problem-solving strategies.

Method: Two-component fine-tuning: World Knowledge Learning (WKL) for knowledge internalization and Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA) for adaptive tool use based on problem difficulty.

Result: 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better tool usage accuracy, outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on custom datasets.

Conclusion: AWL effectively balances knowledge and tool usage, enhancing LLM performance in scientific domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving
scientific problems but often suffer from the issue of hallucination. While
integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool
usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how
human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose
a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the
first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific
knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component,
Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on
the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy
problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on six
scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics,
and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models
post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better
tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o
and Claude-3.5 on four custom-created datasets. Our code is open-source at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reasoning mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing a minimal propositional logic problem, revealing modular sub-circuits and analogous mechanisms across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs solve reasoning problems, including whether reasoning is localized or modular, and to uncover the underlying pathways and components.

Method: Uses causal mediation analysis on Mistral and Gemma models (up to 27B parameters) to study attention heads and decompose reasoning into sub-circuits.

Result: Identifies a sparse circuit with four modular sub-circuits and finds analogous but not identical mechanisms in Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and Gemma-2-27B.

Conclusion: LLMs employ modular and analogous reasoning mechanisms, with insights into attention head functions and sub-circuit roles.

Abstract: Due to the size and complexity of modern large language models (LLMs), it has
proven challenging to uncover the underlying mechanisms that models use to
solve reasoning problems. For instance, is their reasoning for a specific
problem localized to certain parts of the network? Do they break down the
reasoning problem into modular components that are then executed as sequential
steps as we go deeper in the model? To better understand the reasoning
capability of LLMs, we study a minimal propositional logic problem that
requires combining multiple facts to arrive at a solution. By studying this
problem on Mistral and Gemma models, up to 27B parameters, we illuminate the
core components the models use to solve such logic problems. From a mechanistic
interpretability point of view, we use causal mediation analysis to uncover the
pathways and components of the LLMs' reasoning processes. Then, we offer
fine-grained insights into the functions of attention heads in different
layers. We not only find a sparse circuit that computes the answer, but we
decompose it into sub-circuits that have four distinct and modular uses.
Finally, we reveal that three distinct models -- Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B and
Gemma-2-27B -- contain analogous but not identical mechanisms.

### [590] [Watermarking Language Models through Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05091)
*Agnibh Dasgupta, Abdullah Tanvir, Xin Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prompt-guided watermarking framework for LLMs operates at the input level, requiring no model internals, and adapts dynamically to prompts while being robust across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for provenance tracing, content regulation, and model accountability in LLMs without relying on model internals or static rules.

Method: A modular framework with three components: Prompting LM (synthesizes watermarking instructions), Marking LM (generates watermarked outputs), and Detecting LM (classifies watermarks).

Result: Watermark signals generalize across architectures (e.g., GPT-4o, Mistral) and remain robust under fine-tuning, distillation, and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, adaptable, and robust for watermarking LLM outputs.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of large language models (LLMs) is critical for
provenance tracing, content regulation, and model accountability. Existing
approaches often rely on access to model internals or are constrained by static
rules and token-level perturbations. Moreover, the idea of steering generative
behavior via prompt-based instruction control remains largely underexplored. We
introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the
input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The
framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that
synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that
generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a
Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded
watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to
individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures,
including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework
over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral,
LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals
generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model
distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

*Leander Weber, Jim Berend, Moritz Weckbecker, Alexander Binder, Thomas Wiegand, Wojciech Samek, Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP) is a novel training method for neural networks that avoids gradient computation, using explainability techniques to decompose rewards to neurons. It is efficient and flexible, demonstrated in pruning and training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based optimization is limited by its reliance on differentiation, which may not suit non-differentiable architectures like neuromorphic systems. LFP addresses this by offering an alternative training principle.

Method: LFP decomposes rewards to individual neurons based on their contributions, then greedily reinforces helpful neurons and weakens harmful ones. It avoids gradients and produces sparse updates.

Result: LFP achieves comparable performance to gradient descent while being more memory- and energy-efficient. It is effective for neural network pruning and SNN training.

Conclusion: LFP provides a flexible, efficient alternative to gradient-based optimization, suitable for diverse architectures and objectives, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization has been a cornerstone of machine learning that
enabled the vast advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development over the
past decades. However, this type of optimization requires differentiation, and
with recent evidence of the benefits of non-differentiable (e.g. neuromorphic)
architectures over classical models w.r.t. efficiency, such constraints can
become limiting in the future. We present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation
(LFP), a novel training principle for neural network-like predictors that
utilizes methods from the domain of explainability to decompose a reward to
individual neurons based on their respective contributions. Leveraging these
neuron-wise rewards, our method then implements a greedy approach reinforcing
helpful parts of the network and weakening harmful ones. While having
comparable computational complexity to gradient descent, LFP does not require
gradient computation and generates sparse and thereby memory- and
energy-efficient parameter updates and models. We establish the convergence of
LFP theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness on various
models and datasets. Via two applications - neural network pruning and the
approximation-free training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) - we demonstrate
that LFP combines increased efficiency in terms of computation and
representation with flexibility w.r.t. choice of model architecture and
objective function. Our code is available at

*Alkis Kalavasis, Anay Mehrotra, Grigoris Velegkas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether language models can generate valid, unseen strings (consistency) while capturing the full richness of a language (breadth). It finds this impossible for most models without negative examples but achievable with them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if language models can avoid hallucinations (invalid outputs) and mode collapse (limited expressiveness) by meeting both consistency and breadth requirements.

Method: Investigates within a statistical language generation framework, building on Gold and Angluin, using random samples from an unknown language. Analyzes convergence of model outputs to unseen strings.

Result: Negative answer: most models, including next-token predictors, cannot achieve both consistency and breadth without negative examples. However, it's possible with negative examples.

Conclusion: Post-training feedback (negative examples) is crucial for reducing hallucinations and mode collapse, enabling consistent generation with breadth.

Abstract: Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but
certain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language,
the trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be
expressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise,
outputting invalid strings constitutes "hallucination," and failing to capture
the full range leads to "mode collapse." We ask if a language model can meet
both requirements.
  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building
on Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a
distribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite
collection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say
the model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size
increases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.
  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in
language generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class
of language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible
for most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s
result, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any
countable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with
breadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.
  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples
needed for generation with or without breadth.
  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is
achievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples
(strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that
post-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in
reducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.

*Qizhou Wang, Guansong Pang, Mahsa Salehi, Xiaokun Xia, Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSReg, a novel open-set Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) method, to improve detection of unseen anomalies while maintaining performance on seen anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised GAD methods over-fit seen anomalies, leading to poor detection of unseen anomalies. Existing open-set AD models fail to handle graph data effectively.

Method: Proposes NSReg, which uses a regularization term to learn compact, semantically-rich normal node representations based on structural relations.

Result: NSReg outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14% AUC-ROC on unseen anomalies and 10% on all anomalies.

Conclusion: NSReg effectively reduces false negatives for unseen anomalies and improves overall detection performance.

Abstract: This paper considers an important Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely
open-set GAD, which aims to train a detection model using a small number of
normal and anomaly nodes (referred to as seen anomalies) to detect both seen
anomalies and unseen anomalies (i.e., anomalies that cannot be illustrated the
training anomalies). Those labelled training data provide crucial prior
knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced
detection errors. However, current supervised GAD methods tend to
over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to many errors of detecting
the unseen anomalies as normal nodes. Further, existing open-set AD models were
introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture
discriminative features from graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In
this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure
regularisation (NSReg), to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen
anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The
key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the
learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on
their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised
anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong
normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids over-fitting the
seen anomalies and learns a better normality decision boundary, largely
reducing the false negatives of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive
empirical results on seven real-world datasets show that NSReg significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 14% AUC-ROC on the
unseen anomaly classes and by 10% AUC-ROC on all anomaly classes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MPO extends DPO for aligning language models by optimizing over sets of responses, using groupwise comparisons and deviation-based weighting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO is limited to pairwise preferences, while practical pipelines involve multiple candidate responses per prompt. MPO addresses this gap.

Method: MPO generalizes DPO by extending the Bradley-Terry model to groupwise comparisons and employs deviation-based weighting for outlier emphasis.

Result: MPO reduces alignment bias theoretically and achieves up to 17.5% improvement in win rate on benchmarks.

Conclusion: MPO sets a new baseline for preference-based alignment, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular approach for
aligning language models using pairwise preferences. However, in practical
post-training pipelines, on-policy generation typically yields multiple
candidate responses per prompt, which are scored by a reward model to guide
learning. In this setting, we propose $\textbf{Multi-Preference Optimization
(MPO)}$, a generalization of DPO that optimizes over entire sets of responses
by extending the Bradley-Terry model to groupwise comparisons between chosen
and rejected sets. To further enhance learning, MPO employs deviation-based
weighting, which emphasizes outlier responses that deviate most from the mean
reward, effectively inducing a self-paced curriculum. We theoretically prove
that MPO reduces alignment bias at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ with respect to the number of
responses per query. Empirically, MPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the UltraFeedback benchmark and yields up to $\sim 17.5\%$ improvement over the
state-of-the-art baseline in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2,
establishing a new baseline for preference-based alignment

TL;DR: The paper addresses the contextual best arm identification problem, proposing an adaptive experiment design to identify the best treatment arm based on covariates. It introduces a policy for recommendations and evaluates performance using worst-case expected regret. The proposed PLAS strategy is proven minimax rate-optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the contextual BAI problem by designing adaptive experiments that efficiently identify the best treatment arm given contextual information.

Method: Proposes the Adaptive Sampling-Policy Learning (PLAS) strategy, which adaptively assigns treatments and learns a recommendation policy. Derives a lower bound for expected simple regret and evaluates PLAS against it.

Result: PLAS is shown to be minimax rate-optimal, with its regret upper bound matching the derived lower bound as the number of experimental units grows.

Conclusion: The PLAS strategy effectively addresses the contextual BAI problem, achieving optimal performance in terms of expected regret.

Abstract: This study investigates the contextual best arm identification (BAI) problem,
aiming to design an adaptive experiment to identify the best treatment arm
conditioned on contextual information (covariates). We consider a
decision-maker who assigns treatment arms to experimental units during an
experiment and recommends the estimated best treatment arm based on the
contexts at the end of the experiment. The decision-maker uses a policy for
recommendations, which is a function that provides the estimated best treatment
arm given the contexts. In our evaluation, we focus on the worst-case expected
regret, a relative measure between the expected outcomes of an optimal policy
and our proposed policy. We derive a lower bound for the expected simple regret
and then propose a strategy called Adaptive Sampling-Policy Learning (PLAS). We
prove that this strategy is minimax rate-optimal in the sense that its leading
factor in the regret upper bound matches the lower bound as the number of
experimental units increases.

TL;DR: Ladder Residual, a modification for residual-based models, hides communication latency in multi-GPU inference, improving speed by 29% for a 70B parameter model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model inference is memory and time-intensive, with communication between GPUs being a bottleneck in distributed setups.

Method: Introduces Ladder Residual, an architectural change to decouple communication from computation, tested with Tensor Parallelism.

Result: Achieves 29% speedup for a 70B parameter model; comparable performance in 1B and 3B models; minimal accuracy loss when adapting Llama-3.1 8B.

Conclusion: Ladder Residual effectively reduces communication bottlenecks, enabling faster inference without significant performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Large language model inference is both memory-intensive and time-consuming,
often requiring distributed algorithms to efficiently scale. Various model
parallelism strategies are used in multi-gpu training and inference to
partition computation across multiple devices, reducing memory load and
computation time. However, using model parallelism necessitates communication
of information between GPUs, which has been a major bottleneck and limits the
gains obtained by scaling up the number of devices. We introduce Ladder
Residual, a simple architectural modification applicable to all residual-based
models that enables straightforward overlapping that effectively hides the
latency of communication. Our insight is that in addition to systems
optimization, one can also redesign the model architecture to decouple
communication from computation. While Ladder Residual can allow
communication-computation decoupling in conventional parallelism patterns, we
focus on Tensor Parallelism in this paper, which is particularly bottlenecked
by its heavy communication. For a Transformer model with 70B parameters,
applying Ladder Residual to all its layers can achieve 29% end-to-end wall
clock speed up at inference time with TP sharding over 8 devices. We refer the
resulting Transformer model as the Ladder Transformer. We train a 1B and 3B
Ladder Transformer from scratch and observe comparable performance to a
standard dense transformer baseline. We also show that it is possible to
convert parts of the Llama-3.1 8B model to our Ladder Residual architecture
with minimal accuracy degradation by only retraining for 3B tokens. We release
our code for training and inference for easier replication of experiments.

TL;DR: A novel inference-time alignment method, InferenceGuard, ensures safe LLM responses by modeling safety as a constrained MDP in latent space, achieving formal safety guarantees without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate safe LLM responses almost surely, avoiding resource-intensive methods like RLHF.

Method: Models safe response generation as a constrained MDP in latent space, dynamically penalizing unsafe outputs.

Result: InferenceGuard outperforms existing methods in balancing safety and task performance.

Conclusion: InferenceGuard offers a practical, safer alternative for LLM alignment at inference-time.

Abstract: We introduce a novel inference-time alignment approach for LLMs that aims to
generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with probability approaching one.
Our approach models the generation of safe responses as a constrained Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within the LLM's latent space. We augment a safety state
that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and dynamically penalize unsafe
generations to ensure the generation of safe responses. Consequently, we
demonstrate formal safety guarantees w.r.t. the given cost model upon solving
the MDP in the latent space with sufficiently large penalties. Building on this
foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely
aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate
that InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance,
outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and
aligned responses. Our findings contribute to the advancement of safer LLM
deployment through alignment at inference-time, thus presenting a promising
alternative to resource-intensive, overfitting-prone alignment techniques like
RLHF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the Tanimoto kernel beyond binary and nonnegative real-valued attributes to arbitrary real-valued functions for broader applicability.

Method: Unifies attribute representation via sets, derives the general kernel form, extracts explicit features, and includes general kernels into the Tanimoto kernel. Also expresses the kernel as a quotient of piecewise linear functions and provides a smooth approximation.

Result: A generalized Tanimoto kernel capable of measuring similarity between arbitrary real-valued functions, with explicit feature representation and smooth approximation.

Conclusion: The extended Tanimoto kernel offers a versatile tool for similarity measurement across a wider range of data types, with practical implementations for feature extraction and smooth approximations.

Abstract: The Tanimoto kernel (Jaccard index) is a well known tool to describe the
similarity between sets of binary attributes. It has been extended to the case
when the attributes are nonnegative real values. This paper introduces a more
general Tanimoto kernel formulation which allows to measure the similarity of
arbitrary real-valued functions. This extension is constructed by unifying the
representation of the attributes via properly chosen sets. After deriving the
general form of the kernel, explicit feature representation is extracted from
the kernel function, and a simply way of including general kernels into the
Tanimoto kernel is shown. Finally, the kernel is also expressed as a quotient
of piecewise linear functions, and a smooth approximation is provided.

Method: FALCON uses hierarchical long/short-term memory and meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards for global-local optimization.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance, surpassing benchmarks by 4.5% (MBPP) and 6.1% (Humaneval).

Conclusion: FALCON effectively addresses LLM limitations in code generation, offering a robust solution with open-sourced implementation.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in
automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following
capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in
coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked
diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore,
challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise,
human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code
generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose
Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization
(i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the
global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying
learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the
incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems.
Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to
solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's
adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading
other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the
MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark. The
open-sourced code is publicly available at https://github.com/titurte/FALCON.

### [600] [EF21 with Bells & Whistles: Six Algorithmic Extensions of Modern Error Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03294)
*Ilyas Fatkhullin, Igor Sokolov, Eduard Gorbunov, Zhize Li, Peter Richt√°rik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes six practical extensions of the EF21 error feedback mechanism, improving convergence theory and practical performance in distributed gradient-based optimization with compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing error feedback (EF) mechanisms rely on strong assumptions and provide pessimistic convergence rates. EF21 addressed these issues, and this work extends EF21 further for broader applicability.

Method: The authors introduce six extensions to EF21: partial participation, stochastic approximation, variance reduction, proximal setting, momentum, and bidirectional compression.

Result: The proposed extensions are supported by strong convergence theory, with some techniques offering improved guarantees over prior work.

Conclusion: The extensions enhance EF21's practicality and theoretical robustness, addressing limitations of previous EF mechanisms.

Abstract: First proposed by Seide (2014) as a heuristic, error feedback (EF) is a very
popular mechanism for enforcing convergence of distributed gradient-based
optimization methods enhanced with communication compression strategies based
on the application of contractive compression operators. However, existing
theory of EF relies on very strong assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients), and
provides pessimistic convergence rates (e.g., while the best known rate for EF
in the smooth nonconvex regime, and when full gradients are compressed, is
$O(1/T^{2/3})$, the rate of gradient descent in the same regime is $O(1/T)$).
Recently, Richt\'arik et al. (2021) proposed a new error feedback mechanism,
EF21, based on the construction of a Markov compressor induced by a contractive
compressor. EF21 removes the aforementioned theoretical deficiencies of EF and
at the same time works better in practice. In this work we propose six
practical extensions of EF21, all supported by strong convergence theory:
partial participation, stochastic approximation, variance reduction, proximal
setting, momentum, and bidirectional compression. To the best of our knowledge,
several of these techniques have not been previously analyzed in combination
with EF, and in cases where prior analysis exists -- such as for bidirectional
compression -- our theoretical convergence guarantees significantly improve
upon existing results.

*Iulia Duta, Giulia Cassar√†, Fabrizio Silvestri, Pietro Li√≤*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces cellular sheaves for hypergraphs to enhance higher-order relations modeling, proposing two sheaf hypergraph Laplacians and neural networks that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher-order relations are common but current hypergraph representations lack expressive structure. The goal is to improve modeling of complex interactions.

Method: Develops linear and non-linear sheaf hypergraph Laplacians, then designs Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks and Convolutional Networks.

Result: The proposed models achieve top performance on hypergraph node classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating sheaves into hypergraph Laplacians provides a more expressive inductive bias, improving modeling of complex data structures.

Abstract: Higher-order relations are widespread in nature, with numerous phenomena
involving complex interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise connections.
As a result, advancements in higher-order processing can accelerate the growth
of various fields requiring structured data. Current approaches typically
represent these interactions using hypergraphs. We enhance this representation
by introducing cellular sheaves for hypergraphs, a mathematical construction
that adds extra structure to the conventional hypergraph while maintaining
their local, higherorder connectivity. Drawing inspiration from existing
Laplacians in the literature, we develop two unique formulations of sheaf
hypergraph Laplacians: linear and non-linear. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that incorporating sheaves into the hypergraph Laplacian provides
a more expressive inductive bias than standard hypergraph diffusion, creating a
powerful instrument for effectively modelling complex data structures. We
employ these sheaf hypergraph Laplacians to design two categories of models:
Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks and Sheaf Hypergraph Convolutional Networks.
These models generalize classical Hypergraph Networks often found in the
literature. Through extensive experimentation, we show that this generalization
significantly improves performance, achieving top results on multiple benchmark
datasets for hypergraph node classification.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Haizhong Zheng, Yang Zhou, Emma Strubell, Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smaller models' effectiveness is overestimated due to overlooked memory bottlenecks. The Kinetics Scaling Law, incorporating computation and memory costs, suggests larger models are more efficient. Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, especially in low-cost regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overestimation of smaller models' effectiveness and the inefficiencies caused by memory bottlenecks in test-time scaling.

Method: Proposes the Kinetics Scaling Law, analyzing models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, and introduces sparse attention to reduce per-token costs.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, with significant gains in problem-solving accuracy (60+ points in low-cost, 5+ in high-cost regimes).

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for efficient test-time scaling, as accuracy continues to improve with increased computation, unlike in training.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
and increasingly important with more computing invested, for realizing the full
potential of test-time scaling where, unlike training, accuracy has yet to
saturate as a function of computation, and continues to improve through
increased generation. The code is available at

### [603] [On the Robustness of Decision-Focused Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16487)
*Yehya Farhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFL integrates prediction and optimization tasks for better decision-making, but its robustness under adversarial attacks is poorly understood. This study benchmarks ten DFL methods under attacks, linking robustness to prediction-decision alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) models under adversarial attacks, as their performance in such scenarios is largely unknown.

Method: Adopted ten unique DFL methods and benchmarked their performance under two distinct adversarial attacks tailored for the Predict-then-Optimize setting.

Result: Found that model robustness correlates with its ability to align predictions with optimal decisions without deviating from ground-truth labels. Also identified how models violating this condition respond differently based on training optimality.

Conclusion: DFL models' robustness depends on prediction-decision alignment, and violating this condition makes them vulnerable to attacks. Insights provided can guide future DFL model development for adversarial resilience.

Abstract: Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) is an emerging learning paradigm that tackles
the task of training a machine learning (ML) model to predict missing
parameters of an incomplete optimization problem, where the missing parameters
are predicted. DFL trains an ML model in an end-to-end system, by integrating
the prediction and optimization tasks, providing better alignment of the
training and testing objectives. DFL has shown a lot of promise and holds the
capacity to revolutionize decision-making in many real-world applications.
However, very little is known about the performance of these models under
adversarial attacks. We adopt ten unique DFL methods and benchmark their
performance under two distinctly focused attacks adapted towards the
Predict-then-Optimize problem setting. Our study proposes the hypothesis that
the robustness of a model is highly correlated with its ability to find
predictions that lead to optimal decisions without deviating from the
ground-truth label. Furthermore, we provide insight into how to target the
models that violate this condition and show how these models respond
differently depending on the achieved optimality at the end of their training
cycles.

*Ziyu Zhao, Yixiao Zhou, Zhi Zhang, Didi Zhu, Tao Shen, Zexi Li, Jinluan Yang, Xuwu Wang, Jing Su, Kun Kuang, Zhongyu Wei, Fei Wu, Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMoRA integrates LoRA and MoE into a unified framework, treating each rank as an expert, enabling finer-grained knowledge sharing and better multi-task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla LoRA struggles with task conflicts in multi-task scenarios, and existing MoE-based methods isolate knowledge within tasks, missing shared knowledge.

Method: Proposes SMoRA, which dynamically activates ranks within a single LoRA, treating each rank as an expert for finer-grained partitioning.

Result: SMoRA activates fewer parameters but outperforms in multi-task scenarios, demonstrating better performance gains.

Conclusion: SMoRA effectively combines LoRA and MoE, improving multi-task adaptation by leveraging shared knowledge and reducing task conflicts.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used for adapting large language models
(LLMs) to specific domains due to its efficiency and modularity. Meanwhile,
vanilla LoRA struggles with task conflicts in multi-task scenarios. Recent
works adopt Mixture of Experts (MoE) by treating each LoRA module as an expert,
thereby mitigating task interference through multiple specialized LoRA modules.
While effective, these methods often isolate knowledge within individual tasks,
failing to fully exploit the shared knowledge across related tasks. In this
paper, we establish a connection between single LoRA and multi-LoRA MoE,
integrating them into a unified framework. We demonstrate that the dynamic
routing of multiple LoRAs is functionally equivalent to rank partitioning and
block-level activation within a single LoRA. We further empirically demonstrate
that finer-grained LoRA partitioning, within the same total and activated
parameter constraints, leads to better performance gains across heterogeneous
tasks. Building on these findings, we propose Single-ranked Mixture of Experts
LoRA (\textbf{SMoRA}), which embeds MoE into LoRA by \textit{treating each rank
as an independent expert}. With a \textit{dynamic rank-wise activation}
mechanism, SMoRA promotes finer-grained knowledge sharing while mitigating task
conflicts. Experiments demonstrate that SMoRA activates fewer parameters yet
achieves better performance in multi-task scenarios.

*Moran Yanuka, Morris Alper, Hadar Averbuch-Elor, Raja Giryes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new metric, image caption concreteness (ICC), to filter noisy text-image pairs in multimodal learning by measuring caption concreteness without image reference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of noisy datasets in multimodal learning, where existing methods fail to isolate concrete samples for strong learning signals.

Method: Leverages foundation models to measure visual-semantic information loss in multimodal representations, correlating with human concreteness evaluations.

Result: ICC strongly correlates with human evaluations and effectively selects high-quality samples for efficient training.

Conclusion: ICC complements existing methods, improving dataset curation for resource-constrained multimodal learning.

Abstract: Web-scale training on paired text-image data is becoming increasingly central
to multimodal learning, but is challenged by the highly noisy nature of
datasets in the wild. Standard data filtering approaches succeed in removing
mismatched text-image pairs, but permit semantically related but highly
abstract or subjective text. These approaches lack the fine-grained ability to
isolate the most concrete samples that provide the strongest signal for
learning in a noisy dataset. In this work, we propose a new metric, image
caption concreteness, that evaluates caption text without an image reference to
measure its concreteness and relevancy for use in multimodal learning. Our
approach leverages strong foundation models for measuring visual-semantic
information loss in multimodal representations. We demonstrate that this
strongly correlates with human evaluation of concreteness in both single-word
and sentence-level texts. Moreover, we show that curation using ICC complements
existing approaches: It succeeds in selecting the highest quality samples from
multimodal web-scale datasets to allow for efficient training in
resource-constrained settings.

*Vaskar Nath, Elaine Lau, Anisha Gunjal, Manasi Sharma, Nikhil Baharte, Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR training improves reasoning models by compressing pass@k into pass@1 and enabling capability gain. Self-distillation is key for solving new problems. The $	ext{Guide}$ algorithm, incorporating hints and optimizing off-policy trajectories, enhances performance, showing up to 4% improvement on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning models trained with RLVR learn to solve new problems and improve performance through methods like self-distillation and adaptive hint integration.

Method: RLVR training is used to compress pass@k into pass@1 and achieve capability gain. The $	ext{Guide}$ algorithm adaptively incorporates hints and optimizes off-policy trajectories, tested on models from 0.5B to 72B parameters.

Result: Capability gain is observed across model scales, with self-distillation driving problem-solving. $	ext{Guide}$ improves pass@k rates, showing up to 4% macro-average improvement on math benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLVR and $	ext{Guide}$ enhance reasoning models' performance, with self-distillation and adaptive hint integration being key factors. The findings are validated across diverse domains and model scales.

Abstract: We study the process through which reasoning models trained with
reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards (RLVR) can learn to solve new
problems. We find that RLVR drives performance in two main ways: (1) by
compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via "capability gain" in which models
learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high
$k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to
solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We
demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B
parameters on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final
answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can
significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance
for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to
derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive
$\text{Guide}$ -- a new class of online training algorithms. $\text{Guide}$
adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which
all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio
for the "off-policy" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts
in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of
$\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and
32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with
up to 4$\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks. We include
careful ablations to analyze $\text{Guide}$'s components and theoretically
analyze Guide's learning efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EHRFL is a federated learning framework for building cost-effective, host-specific predictive models using EHR data, addressing compatibility and budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical prediction accuracy while preserving patient privacy and complying with regulations, federated learning is needed, but challenges like EHR system heterogeneity and cost management arise.

Method: EHRFL includes text-based EHR modeling for cross-institution compatibility and a participant selection strategy based on patient embedding similarity to reduce costs.

Result: Experiments on open-source EHR datasets show EHRFL's effectiveness in maintaining performance while reducing costs.

Conclusion: EHRFL provides a practical solution for healthcare institutions to build tailored predictive models within budget constraints.

Abstract: The increasing volume of electronic health records (EHRs) presents the
opportunity to improve the accuracy and robustness of models in clinical
prediction tasks. Unlike traditional centralized approaches, federated learning
enables training on data from multiple institutions while preserving patient
privacy and complying with regulatory constraints. In practice, healthcare
institutions (i.e., hosts) often need to build predictive models tailored to
their specific needs using federated learning. In this scenario, two key
challenges arise: (1) ensuring compatibility across heterogeneous EHR systems,
and (2) managing federated learning costs within budget constraints. To address
these challenges, we propose EHRFL, a federated learning framework designed for
building a cost-effective, host-specific predictive model using patient EHR
data. EHRFL consists of two components: (1) text-based EHR modeling, which
facilitates cross-institution compatibility without costly data
standardization, and (2) a participant selection strategy based on averaged
patient embedding similarity to reduce the number of participants without
degrading performance. Experiments on multiple open-source EHR datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of both components. We believe our framework
offers a practical solution for enabling healthcare institutions to build
institution-specific predictive models under budgetary constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for statistically guaranteed prediction sets in functional machine learning, using SVD and zonotopes for reliable PDE emulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for reliable PDE emulators by ensuring conformal prediction coverage guarantees.

Method: Constructs nested prediction sets on SVD-based error representations, using zonotopes for exact linear propagation.

Result: Produces prediction sets with conformal guarantees, applicable to complex models like Neural Operators.

Conclusion: The method is model-agnostic, handles truncation error, and ensures reliable predictions for functional surrogate models.

Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining statistically guaranteed prediction sets
for functional machine learning methods: surrogate models which map between
function spaces, motivated by the need to build reliable PDE emulators. The
method constructs nested prediction sets on a low-dimensional representation
(an SVD) of the surrogate model's error, and then maps these sets to the
prediction space using set-propagation techniques. This results in prediction
sets for functional surrogate models with conformal prediction coverage
guarantees. We use zonotopes as basis of the set construction, which allow an
exact linear propagation and are closed under Cartesian products, making them
well-suited to this high-dimensional problem. The method is model agnostic and
can thus be applied to complex Sci-ML models, including Neural Operators, but
also in simpler settings. We also introduce a technique to capture the
truncation error of the SVD, preserving the guarantees of the method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM introduces a framework for nuanced feature descriptions in neural networks, addressing polysemanticity and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume monosemanticity, limiting feature descriptions' expressiveness and robustness.

Method: PRISM provides nuanced descriptions for polysemantic and monosemantic features, benchmarking against existing methods.

Result: PRISM improves description quality and captures distinct concepts better, validated via scores.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances interpretability by addressing polysemanticity, offering more accurate feature descriptions.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural architecture candidates is computationally expensive; nasgraph aims to reduce this overhead.

Method: Converts neural architectures to graphs and uses average degree as a proxy metric, avoiding training.

Result: Finds top architectures quickly (217 CPU seconds for 200 samples) and performs well across datasets.

Conclusion: nasgraph is efficient, data-agnostic, and generalizes well to challenging tasks.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) enables the automatic design of neural
network models. However, training the candidates generated by the search
algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational
overhead. Our method, dubbed nasgraph, remarkably reduces the computational
costs by converting neural architectures to graphs and using the average
degree, a graph measure, as the proxy in lieu of the evaluation metric. Our
training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the
best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in
217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance
on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search
spaces. We also demonstrate that nasgraph generalizes to more challenging tasks
on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training with cross-entropy loss can misalign with pass@N test-time compute, reducing accuracy. A modified training loss improves performance by limiting model overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize LLM performance under test-time compute strategies like pass@N, given the misalignment of cross-entropy loss with such strategies.

Method: Analyze pass@N strategy, identify overconfidence from CE loss, and propose a modified training loss to align with pass@N.

Result: Improved mathematical reasoning on MATH and MiniF2F benchmarks, rescuing pass@N performance.

Conclusion: Co-designing training and test-time strategies is crucial for optimizing LLM performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the power of
scaling test-time compute to achieve strong performance on complex tasks, such
as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This raises a critical question:
how should model training be modified to optimize performance under a
subsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on
pass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$
independent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy
(CE) loss can be ${\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\it
decreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment
in terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our
prediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via
pass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is
better aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test
performance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH
and MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math
questions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying
shapes. Overall our work underscores the importance of co-designing two
traditionally separate phases of LLM development: training-time protocols and
test-time search and reasoning strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), an extension of the Transformer framework, to address its limitations in relational reasoning by incorporating separate sensory and relational attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural architectures, including Transformers, struggle with relational reasoning tasks, lacking explicit mechanisms for processing relational information.

Method: The proposed DAT features dual attention mechanisms: sensory attention for object properties and relational attention for inter-object relationships.

Result: DAT shows significant performance improvements in data and parameter efficiency across synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit relational mechanisms enhance Transformer performance, making DAT a promising solution for relational reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent systems,
enabling robust and data-efficient inductive generalization. Recent empirical
evidence shows that many existing neural architectures, including Transformers,
struggle with tasks requiring relational reasoning. In this work, we
distinguish between two types of information: sensory information about the
properties of individual objects, and relational information about the
relationships between objects. While neural attention provides a powerful
mechanism for controlling the flow of sensory information between objects, the
Transformer lacks an explicit computational mechanism for routing and
processing relational information. To address this limitation, we propose an
architectural extension of the Transformer framework that we call the Dual
Attention Transformer (DAT), featuring two distinct attention mechanisms:
sensory attention for directing the flow of sensory information, and a novel
relational attention mechanism for directing the flow of relational
information. We empirically evaluate DAT on a diverse set of tasks ranging from
synthetic relational benchmarks to complex real-world tasks such as language
modeling and visual processing. Our results demonstrate that integrating
explicit relational computational mechanisms into the Transformer architecture
leads to significant performance gains in terms of data efficiency and
parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'distributional adversarial loss,' where adversarial perturbations are distributions, not points. It provides PAC-learning bounds and unifies randomized smoothing with robust learning. A derandomization technique for robustness is also presented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in robust learning by considering adversarial perturbations as distributions, not just points, and to bridge the gap between randomized smoothing and robust learning.

Method: Proposes distributional adversarial loss, analyzes its PAC-learning bounds, and introduces a derandomization technique for robustness.

Result: Sample complexity bounds for the new adversarial loss are derived, and the derandomization technique effectively preserves robustness.

Conclusion: The work advances robust learning by unifying randomized smoothing and robust learning, and provides practical tools for derandomizing robust classifiers.

Abstract: We initiate the study of a new notion of adversarial loss which we call
distributional adversarial loss. In this notion, we assume for each original
example, the allowed adversarial perturbation set is a family of distributions,
and the adversarial loss over each example is the maximum loss over all the
associated distributions. The goal is to minimize the overall adversarial loss.
We show sample complexity bounds in the PAC-learning setting for our notion of
adversarial loss. Our notion of adversarial loss contrasts the prior work on
robust learning that considers a set of points, not distributions, as the
perturbation set of each clean example. As an application of our approach, we
show how to unify the two lines of work on randomized smoothing and robust
learning in the PAC-learning setting and derive sample complexity bounds for
randomized smoothing methods.
  Furthermore, we investigate the role of randomness in achieving robustness
against adversarial attacks. We show a general derandomization technique that
preserves the extent of a randomized classifier's robustness against
adversarial attacks and show its effectiveness empirically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spectrum scarcity and network traffic in high-speed mobile IoV environments by leveraging semantic communication.

Method: Extract semantic information, redefine metrics (HSSE, HSR), and use SAC for decision optimization in spectrum sharing.

Result: SSS outperforms baselines, increasing HSSE by 15% and SRS by ~7%.

Conclusion: SSS is effective for semantic-aware spectrum sharing in IoV, enhancing efficiency and transmission success.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate semantic communication in high-speed mobile
Internet of vehicles (IoV) environments, with a focus on the spectrum sharing
between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
communications. We specifically address spectrum scarcity and network traffic
and then propose a semantic-aware spectrum sharing algorithm (SSS) based on the
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) soft actor-critic (SAC) approach. Firstly, we
delve into the extraction of semantic information. Secondly, we redefine
metrics for semantic information in V2V and V2I spectrum sharing in IoV
environments, introducing high-speed semantic spectrum efficiency (HSSE) and
semantic transmission rate (HSR). Finally, we employ the SAC algorithm for
decision optimization in V2V and V2I spectrum sharing based on semantic
information. This optimization encompasses the optimal link of V2V and V2I
sharing strategies, the transmission power for vehicles sending semantic
information and the length of transmitted semantic symbols, aiming at
maximizing HSSE of V2I and enhancing success rate of effective semantic
information transmission (SRS) of V2V. Experimental results demonstrate that
the SSS algorithm outperforms other baseline algorithms, including other
traditional-communication-based spectrum sharing algorithms and spectrum
sharing algorithm using other reinforcement learning approaches. The SSS
algorithm exhibits a 15% increase in HSSE and approximately a 7% increase in
SRS.

*Kangwei Qi, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Jiangzhou Wang, Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a RIS-assisted IoV network using SAC algorithm to optimize V2I and V2V communications, outperforming PPO, DDPG, TD3, and stochastic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance link quality and timeliness in V2X communications, focusing on AoI for V2I and payload stability for V2V.

Method: Formulates the problem as an MDP, using SAC for resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control.

Result: Simulations show superior convergence, reward, AoI, and payload transmission compared to other algorithms.

Conclusion: The SAC-based scheme effectively optimizes RIS-assisted IoV networks, improving performance metrics.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a pivotal technology in
communication, offering an alternative path that significantly enhances the
link quality in wireless communication environments. In this paper, we propose
a RIS-assisted internet of vehicles (IoV) network, considering the
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication method. In addition, in order to
improve the timeliness of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and the
stability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links, we introduce the age of
information (AoI) model and the payload transmission probability model.
Therefore, with the objective of minimizing the AoI of V2I links and
prioritizing transmission of V2V links payload, we construct this optimization
problem as an Markov decision process (MDP) problem in which the BS serves as
an agent to allocate resources and control phase-shift for the vehicles using
the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, which gradually converges and maintains
a high stability. A AoI-aware joint vehicular resource allocation and RIS
phase-shift control scheme based on SAC algorithm is proposed and simulation
results show that its convergence speed, cumulative reward, AoI performance,
and payload transmission probability outperforms those of proximal policy
optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed
deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and stochastic algorithms.

*Th√©o Vincent, Tim Faust, Yogesh Tripathi, Jan Peters, Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EauDeQN is a dense-to-sparse algorithm for reinforcement learning that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based on the agent's learning pace, achieving high sparsity without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense-to-sparse methods use fixed sparsity schedules and require manual tuning of sparsity levels, which can hinder performance.

Method: EauDeQN uses multiple online networks with varying sparsity levels, trained from a shared target network, and selects the best-performing network at each update.

Result: EauDeQN achieves high sparsity while maintaining performance on Atari 2600 and MuJoCo benchmarks.

Conclusion: EauDeQN effectively automates sparsity adjustment, improving efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent works have successfully demonstrated that sparse deep reinforcement
learning agents can be competitive against their dense counterparts. This opens
up opportunities for reinforcement learning applications in fields where
inference time and memory requirements are cost-sensitive or limited by
hardware. Until now, dense-to-sparse methods have relied on hand-designed
sparsity schedules that are not synchronized with the agent's learning pace.
Crucially, the final sparsity level is chosen as a hyperparameter, which
requires careful tuning as setting it too high might lead to poor performances.
In this work, we address these shortcomings by crafting a dense-to-sparse
algorithm that we name Eau De $Q$-Network (EauDeQN). To increase sparsity at
the agent's learning pace, we consider multiple online networks with different
sparsity levels, where each online network is trained from a shared target
network. At each target update, the online network with the smallest loss is
chosen as the next target network, while the other networks are replaced by a
pruned version of the chosen network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the
Atari $2600$ benchmark and the MuJoCo physics simulator, showing that EauDeQN
reaches high sparsity levels while keeping performances high.

*Yu Xie, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Jiangzhou Wang, Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates Digital Twin (DT) with Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) to optimize resource allocation, addressing delays from twin maintenance and computational processing. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MADRL-CSTC) is proposed and validated as effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VEC networks face challenges like high vehicle mobility. DT can model real-time vehicle states, but resource allocation for both DT maintenance and computational services is critical.

Method: The study transforms the problem using satisfaction functions, formulates it as a non-convex optimization, and employs multi-agent Markov decision processes. The MADRL-CSTC algorithm is proposed for collaborative scheduling.

Result: Experimental comparisons show MADRL-CSTC effectively optimizes resource allocation in VEC networks.

Conclusion: Integrating DT with VEC and using MADRL-CSTC improves resource utility and addresses delays, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Abstract: As a promising technology, vehicular edge computing (VEC) can provide
computing and caching services by deploying VEC servers near vehicles. However,
VEC networks still face challenges such as high vehicle mobility. Digital twin
(DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time
states by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT
with VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the
real-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT
model requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer
computing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and
scheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general
VEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two
types of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within
the network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we
propose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource
utility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the
non-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes
to reformulate the problem. Subsequently, we propose the twin maintenance and
computing task processing resource collaborative scheduling (MADRL-CSTC)
algorithm, which leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Through
experimental comparisons with alternative algorithms, it demonstrates that our
proposed approach is effective in terms of resource allocation.

*Shulin Song, Zheng Zhang, Qiong Wu, Qiang Fan, Pingyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize resource reservation intervals and transmission power in NR-V2X, reducing energy consumption and age of information (AoI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable, low-latency vehicle communication in autonomous driving drives the development of NR-V2X, but resource collisions and high energy consumption degrade performance.

Method: Combines NR-V2X with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and uses DRL to optimize transmission parameters.

Result: Simulations show the algorithm effectively reduces energy consumption and AoI.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-based approach enhances NR-V2X performance, balancing energy efficiency and communication reliability.

Abstract: Autonomous driving may be the most important application scenario of next
generation, the development of wireless access technologies enabling reliable
and low-latency vehicle communication becomes crucial. To address this, 3GPP
has developed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) specifications based on 5G New Radio
(NR) technology, where Mode 2 Side-Link (SL) communication resembles Mode 4 in
LTE-V2X, allowing direct communication between vehicles. This supplements SL
communication in LTE-V2X and represents the latest advancement in cellular V2X
(C-V2X) with improved performance of NR-V2X. However, in NR-V2X Mode 2,
resource collisions still occur, and thus degrade the age of information (AOI).
Therefore, a interference cancellation method is employed to mitigate this
impact by combining NR-V2X with Non-Orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
technology. In NR-V2X, when vehicles select smaller resource reservation
interval (RRI), higher-frequency transmissions take ore energy to reduce AoI.
Hence, it is important to jointly consider AoI and communication energy
consumption based on NR-V2X communication. Then, we formulate such an
optimization problem and employ the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm
to compute the optimal transmission RRI and transmission power for each
transmitting vehicle to reduce the energy consumption of each transmitting
vehicle and the AoI of each receiving vehicle. Extensive simulations have
demonstrated the performance of our proposed algorithm.

*Mohammad Zhalechian, Soroush Saghafian, Omar Robles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A combined human-algorithm approach improves the FDA's 510(k) medical device clearance process, reducing recalls by 32.9% and workload by 40.5%, with potential annual savings of $1.7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High recall rates due to ambiguity in the FDA's 510(k) pathway prompt a need for a more effective regulatory framework.

Method: Machine learning estimates recall risk; a data-driven policy recommends acceptance, rejection, or deferral. Empirical study uses 31,000+ device records from FDA and CMS.

Result: 32.9% reduction in recall rate, 40.5% workload reduction, and $1.7B annual cost savings.

Conclusion: A data-driven approach significantly enhances the FDA's 510(k) pathway, reducing risks and costs.

Abstract: The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Premarket
Notification 510(k) pathway allows manufacturers to gain approval for a medical
device by demonstrating its substantial equivalence to another legally marketed
device. However, the inherent ambiguity of this regulatory procedure has led to
high recall rates for many devices cleared through this pathway. This trend has
raised significant concerns regarding the efficacy of the FDA's current
approach, prompting a reassessment of the 510(k) regulatory framework. In this
paper, we develop a combined human-algorithm approach to assist the FDA in
improving its 510(k) medical device clearance process by reducing the risk of
recalls and the workload imposed on the FDA. We first develop machine learning
methods to estimate the risk of recall of 510(k) medical devices based on the
information available at submission time. We then propose a data-driven
clearance policy that recommends acceptance, rejection, or deferral to FDA's
committees for in-depth evaluation. We conduct an empirical study using a
unique large-scale dataset of over 31,000 medical devices that we assembled
based on data sources from the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Service (CMS). A conservative evaluation of our proposed policy based on this
data shows a 32.9% improvement in the recall rate and a 40.5% reduction in the
FDA's workload. Our analyses also indicate that implementing our policy could
result in significant annual cost savings of $1.7 billion, which highlights the
value of using a holistic and data-driven approach to improve the FDA's current
510(k) medical device evaluation pathway.

Motivation: Power grid decarbonization requires adaptive RL controllers, but current methods struggle with grid complexities.

Method: RL2Grid, built on RTE France's framework, standardizes tasks, states, actions, and rewards, integrating operational heuristics and safety constraints.

Result: Reference metrics for RL baselines show the need for novel methods to handle real grid systems.

Conclusion: RL2Grid fosters RL maturity for grid control and highlights future research directions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can provide adaptive and scalable controllers
essential for power grid decarbonization. However, RL methods struggle with
power grids' complex dynamics, long-horizon goals, and hard physical
constraints. For these reasons, we present RL2Grid, a benchmark designed in
collaboration with power system operators to accelerate progress in grid
control and foster RL maturity. Built on RTE France's power simulation
framework, RL2Grid standardizes tasks, state and action spaces, and reward
structures for a systematic evaluation and comparison of RL algorithms.
Moreover, we integrate operational heuristics and design safety constraints
based on human expertise to ensure alignment with physical requirements. By
establishing reference performance metrics for classic RL baselines on
RL2Grid's tasks, we highlight the need for novel methods capable of handling
real systems and discuss future directions for RL-based grid control.

*Xueying Gu, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Qiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLSimCo is a federated learning algorithm for vehicular networks that uses image blur level for aggregation, eliminating the need for labels and improving convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high labeling costs and unsuitability of labeled models in rapidly evolving fields like vehicular networks and MIoT, while tackling issues of blurred images and slow convergence in FL.

Method: Proposes FLSimCo, a label-free FL algorithm that aggregates based on image blur level, serving as a pre-training stage for self-supervised learning.

Result: Simulation results show FLSimCo achieves fast and stable convergence.

Conclusion: FLSimCo effectively addresses challenges in FL for vehicular networks, offering a practical solution for label-free, efficient model training.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an advanced distributed machine learning approach,
that protects the privacy of each vehicle by allowing the model to be trained
on multiple devices simultaneously without the need to upload all data to a
road side unit (RSU). This enables FL to handle scenarios with sensitive or
widely distributed data. However, in these fields, it is well known that the
labeling costs can be a significant expense, and models relying on labels are
not suitable for these rapidly evolving fields especially in vehicular
networks, or mobile internet of things (MIoT), where new data emerges
constantly. To handle this issue, the self-supervised learning paves the way
for training without labels. Additionally, for vehicles with high velocity,
owing to blurred images, simple aggregation not only impacts the accuracy of
the aggregated model but also reduces the convergence speed of FL. This paper
proposes a FL algorithm based on image blur level to aggregation, called
FLSimCo, which does not require labels and serves as a pre-training stage for
self-supervised learning in the vehicular environment. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits fast and stable convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of ISAC in ITS increases computing demands, risking real-time stability. Existing methods like FLSimCo struggle with incomplete tasks.

Method: The enhanced algorithm offloads partial tasks to RSUs, optimizes energy by adjusting transmission power, CPU frequency, and task ratios, and sets an offloading threshold.

Result: Simulations show reduced energy consumption, better offloading efficiency, and higher Federated SSL accuracy.

Conclusion: The improved algorithm effectively balances local and RSU-based training, enhancing system performance.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) leverage Integrated Sensing and
Communications (ISAC) to enhance data exchange between vehicles and
infrastructure in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This integration inevitably
increases computing demands, risking real-time system stability. Vehicle Edge
Computing (VEC) addresses this by offloading tasks to Road Side Unit (RSU),
ensuring timely services. Our previous work FLSimCo algorithm, which uses local
resources for Federated Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), though vehicles often
can't complete all iterations task. Our improved algorithm offloads partial
task to RSU and optimizes energy consumption by adjusting transmission power,
CPU frequency, and task assignment ratios, balancing local and RSU-based
training. Meanwhile, setting an offloading threshold further prevents
inefficiencies. Simulation results show that the enhanced algorithm reduces
energy consumption, improves offloading efficiency and the accuracy of
Federated SSL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of conventional ML (lack of robust representation learning) and deep learning (interpretability issues) in EHR analysis.

Method: Combines data compression and innovative feature selection with custom modules for accuracy and interpretability.

Result: Enhances predictive accuracy and significantly improves interpretability.

Conclusion: DeepSelective is a valuable tool for clinical decision-making, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: The rapid accumulation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has transformed
healthcare by providing valuable data that enhance clinical predictions and
diagnoses. While conventional machine learning models have proven effective,
they often lack robust representation learning and depend heavily on
expert-crafted features. Although deep learning offers powerful solutions, it
is often criticized for its lack of interpretability. To address these
challenges, we propose DeepSelective, a novel end to end deep learning
framework for predicting patient prognosis using EHR data, with a strong
emphasis on enhancing model interpretability. DeepSelective combines data
compression techniques with an innovative feature selection approach,
integrating custom-designed modules that work together to improve both accuracy
and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepSelective not only
enhances predictive accuracy but also significantly improves interpretability,
making it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing reviews by focusing on non-traditional OOD scenarios and providing a new taxonomy.

Method: Classifies OOD detection methods based on user access to the model (training-driven vs. training-agnostic) and discusses pre-trained models.

Result: A new taxonomy, evaluation scenarios, applications, and future research directions are presented.

Conclusion: The survey aims to inspire new methods and practical applications, with a curated list of papers provided.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect test samples outside the
training category space, which is an essential component in building reliable
machine learning systems. Existing reviews on OOD detection primarily focus on
method taxonomy, surveying the field by categorizing various approaches.
However, many recent works concentrate on non-traditional OOD detection
scenarios, such as test-time adaptation, multi-modal data sources and other
novel contexts. In this survey, we uniquely review recent advances in OOD
detection from the task-oriented perspective for the first time. According to
the user's access to the model, that is, whether the OOD detection method is
allowed to modify or retrain the model, we classify the methods as
training-driven or training-agnostic. Besides, considering the rapid
development of pre-trained models, large pre-trained model-based OOD detection
is also regarded as an important category and discussed separately.
Furthermore, we provide a discussion of the evaluation scenarios, a variety of
applications, and several future research directions. We believe this survey
with new taxonomy will benefit the proposal of new methods and the expansion of
more practical scenarios. A curated list of related papers is provided in the

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPIN-ODE, a three-stage neural framework to estimate rate coefficients in stiff chemical reactions, improving stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stiffness in atmospheric chemistry systems causes training instability and poor convergence, hindering rate coefficient estimation with learning-based methods.

Method: SPIN-ODE uses a latent neural ODE, a Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN), and fine-tuning with a neural ODE solver to model reactions and extract rate coefficients.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show SPIN-ODE's effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: SPIN-ODE pioneers stiff Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, advancing neural network integration with detailed chemistry.

Abstract: Estimating rate coefficients from complex chemical reactions is essential for
advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world
atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training
instability and poor convergence that hinder effective rate coefficient
estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff
Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction
modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a
latent neural ODE learns the continuous and differentiable trajectory between
chemical concentrations and their time derivatives; second, an explicit
Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) extracts the underlying rate
coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and third, fine-tune CRNN using a
neural ODE solver to further improve rate coefficient estimation. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate
the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work on stiff
Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising
directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Medha is a system for efficient long-context LLM inference, addressing challenges like HOL blocking and resource inefficiency through adaptive prefill chunking, novel parallelism strategies, and smart scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-context inference are inefficient due to high input length variability, leading to resource waste and performance issues.

Method: Medha introduces adaptive prefill chunking, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP), KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP), and input-length aware scheduling.

Result: Medha scales beyond 10M tokens, reduces latency by 30x, and improves throughput by 5x compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: Medha enables high-performance, production-scale long-context inference while maintaining efficiency for shorter requests.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving
long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We
show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on
techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability
in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource
utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.
  We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM
inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing.
Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill
chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism
strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token
by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower
time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel
input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level
Objectives (SLOs).
  Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining
high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to
state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median
latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering
production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on
shorter requests.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting (IPMF) procedure, combining IMF and IPF for solving the Schr√∂dinger Bridge problem, with practical benefits in tasks like domain translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and inefficiency of the IMF procedure in solving the Schr√∂dinger Bridge problem by integrating it with the IPF procedure.

Method: Proposes IPMF, a heuristic modification alternating between forward and backward time diffusion, combining IMF and IPF.

Result: Theoretical and empirical analysis confirms IPMF's convergence and practical advantages, such as flexible trade-offs in image tasks.

Conclusion: IPMF provides a unified, stable framework for SB problems, enhancing task-specific model customization.

Abstract: The Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, which iteratively projects
onto the space of Markov processes and the reciprocal class, successfully
solves the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem. However, an efficient practical
implementation requires a heuristic modification - alternating between fitting
forward and backward time diffusion at each iteration. This modification is
crucial for stabilizing training and achieving reliable results in applications
such as unpaired domain translation. Our work reveals a close connection
between the modified version of IMF and the Iterative Proportional Fitting
(IPF) procedure - a foundational method for the SB problem, also known as
Sinkhorn's algorithm. Specifically, we demonstrate that the heuristic
modification of the IMF effectively integrates both IMF and IPF procedures. We
refer to this combined approach as the Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting
(IPMF) procedure. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we establish the
convergence of IPMF procedure under various settings, contributing to
developing a unified framework for solving SB problems. Moreover, from a
practical standpoint, the IPMF procedure enables a flexible trade-off between
image similarity and generation quality, offering a new mechanism for tailoring
models to specific tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mask-PINNs introduce a learnable mask function to stabilize PINN training by preserving physical consistency while improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of internal covariate shift in PINNs, which disrupts feature distributions and physical consistency, without relying on conventional normalization methods.

Method: Proposes Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture using a smooth, learnable mask function applied pointwise across hidden layers to regulate feature distributions while preserving input-output mappings.

Result: Demonstrates improved prediction accuracy, convergence stability, and robustness, reducing relative L2 errors by up to two orders of magnitude and enabling wider networks.

Conclusion: Mask-PINNs offer a promising solution to stabilize PINN training, enhancing performance and scalability while maintaining physical consistency.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws
directly into the loss function. However, effective training of PINNs remains
challenging due to internal covariate shift, which destabilizes feature
distributions and impairs model expressiveness. While normalization techniques
like Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization are standard remedies in deep
learning, they disrupt the pointwise input-output mappings critical to
preserving the physical consistency in PINNs. In this work, we introduce
Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture that regulates internal feature distributions
through a smooth, learnable mask function applied pointwise across hidden
layers. Unlike conventional normalization methods, the proposed mask function
preserves the deterministic nature of input-output relationships while
suppressing activation drift and saturation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
Mask-PINNs control feature spread near initialization by attenuating gradient
variance growth through a tailored modulation mechanism. Empirically, we
validate the method on multiple PDE benchmarks across diverse activation
functions. Our results show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy,
convergence stability, and robustness, with relative L2 errors reduced by up to
two orders of magnitude over baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
Mask-PINNs enable the effective use of wider networks, overcoming a key
limitation in existing PINN frameworks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, privacy-preserving solution for machine unlearning, balancing effectiveness and model performance.

Abstract: In the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, privacy protection has

including accurately implementing unlearning, ensuring privacy protection
during the unlearning process, and achieving effective unlearning without
significantly compromising model performance. This paper presents a novel
approach to machine unlearning by employing Layer-wise Relevance Analysis and
Neuronal Path Perturbation. We address three primary challenges: the lack of
detailed unlearning principles, privacy guarantees in zero-shot unlearning
scenario, and the balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility.
Our method balances machine unlearning performance and model utility by
identifying and perturbing highly relevant neurons, thereby achieving effective
unlearning. By using data not present in the original training set during the
unlearning process, we satisfy the zero-shot unlearning scenario and ensure
robust privacy protection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively removes targeted data from the target unlearning model while
maintaining the model's utility, offering a practical solution for
privacy-preserving machine learning.

### [630] [Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07895)
*Jiafan Li, Jiaqi Zhu, Liang Chang, Yilin Li, Miaomiao Li, Yang Wang, Hongan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes HGNN-IMA, a model for node classification in multi-modal heterogeneous networks, using inter-modal attention for adaptive fusion and modality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal fusion methods either lose unique modality characteristics or overlook cross-modal guidance in GNN-based propagation.

Method: HGNN-IMA integrates nested inter-modal attention into heterogeneous graph transformer for adaptive fusion and modality alignment, with an attention loss for missing modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments show HGNN-IMA's superiority in node classification tasks.

Conclusion: HGNN-IMA offers an innovative approach for multi-modal data with network structures, improving node classification.

Abstract: Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal
heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's
product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is
crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective
representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods
often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique
characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking
the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper,
we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous
Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node
representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during
the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous
graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is
integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal
fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the
propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities.
Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing
modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the
node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal
data, especially when accompanied with network structures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks, a unified framework generalizing associative memory models with energy functions based on Fenchel-Young losses, enabling sparse transformations and structured retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and unify associative memory models like Hopfield networks, leveraging advancements in memory capacity and connections with self-attention in transformers.

Method: Proposes a framework using Fenchel-Young losses for energy functions, incorporating Tsallis and norm entropies for differentiable update rules and sparse transformations. Extends to structured networks with SparseMAP.

Result: Derives connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval. Validates effectiveness on memory recall tasks, image retrieval, and text rationalization.

Conclusion: The framework unifies traditional and modern Hopfield networks, offering an energy minimization perspective for post-transformations and demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Associative memory models, such as Hopfield networks and their modern
variants, have garnered renewed interest due to advancements in memory capacity
and connections with self-attention in transformers. In this work, we introduce
a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these
models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as
the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a
generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other
applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and
norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable
sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins,
sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this
framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation,
allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern.
Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and
provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used
post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all
through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis
as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks
on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall.
Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and
text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Xiaohui Wang, Peng Ye, Chenyu Huang, Shenghe Zheng, Bo Zhang, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraDelta is a data-free delta compression pipeline achieving ultra-high compression and strong performance by minimizing redundancy and maximizing information across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the storage overhead of fine-tuned models and the limitations of existing delta compression methods in maintaining high compression and performance.

Method: Uses Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation, Distribution-Aware Compression, and Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling to optimize compression.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance across large language, NLP, vision, and multi-modal models with compression ratios up to 800x.

Conclusion: UltraDelta outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression, offering a scalable solution for multi-tasking.

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous
fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta
compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly
compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained
model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high
compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these
challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression
pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance.
UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and
stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions,
using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation
assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance
layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression
applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by
group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3)
Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a
global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression.
Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2
7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base)
with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and
(d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that
UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under
ultra-high compression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies decentralized learning in two-sided matching markets with time-varying preferences, proposing algorithms for stable matching and latent environment identification with logarithmic regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sequential learning in multi-agent resource-constrained matching markets with non-stationary preferences and latent environments.

Method: Proposes learning algorithms based on the linear contextual bandit framework, where arm-means are linear functions of known features and unknown agent-specific parameters.

Result: Achieves instance-dependent logarithmic regret, scaling independently of the number of arms, making it suitable for large markets.

Conclusion: The algorithms effectively identify latent environments and achieve stable matchings, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Sequential learning in a multi-agent resource constrained matching market has
received significant interest in the past few years. We study decentralized
learning in two-sided matching markets where the demand side (aka players or
agents) competes for the supply side (aka arms) with potentially time-varying
preferences to obtain a stable match. Motivated by the linear contextual bandit
framework, we assume that for each agent, an arm-mean may be represented by a
linear function of a known feature vector and an unknown (agent-specific)
parameter. Moreover, the preferences over arms depend on a latent environment
in each round, where the latent environment varies across rounds in a
non-stationary manner. We propose learning algorithms to identify the latent
environment and obtain stable matchings simultaneously. Our proposed algorithms
achieve instance-dependent logarithmic regret, scaling independently of the
number of arms, and hence applicable for a large market.

*Luca Colombo, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fully binary, gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs is proposed, improving accuracy and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BNN training methods rely on floating-point SGD, limiting binary operation benefits to inference. This work aims to enable fully binary training.

Method: Uses local binary error signals, binary weight updates, and integer-valued hidden weights for neurobiological plausibility, employing XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations.

Result: Achieves up to +35.47% test accuracy over existing binary solutions and +35.30% over full-precision SGD, with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm enables efficient, fully binary training of multi-layer BNNs, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) significantly reduce computational complexity
and memory usage in machine and deep learning by representing weights and
activations with just one bit. However, most existing training algorithms for
BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference
phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and
gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for
back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm
relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing
integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity
mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed
solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using
exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental
results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy
improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer
state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution
improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand,
while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in
terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made
available to the scientific community as a public repository.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Nonlinear Attention (NLA) mechanism to improve RL training efficiency by enhancing feature interactions, achieving faster convergence without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training RL agents is computationally expensive and time-consuming, prompting the need for more efficient methods.

Method: A modified attention mechanism applies a non-linear transformation to key vectors (K) to create enriched representations (K'), improving feature interactions.

Result: The NLA mechanism enables faster convergence and better training efficiency while matching baseline performance.

Conclusion: Nonlinear attention mechanisms can accelerate RL training effectively without compromising performance.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant
computational resources and prolonged training durations. To address this
challenge, we build upon prior work that introduced a neural architecture with
permutation-invariant sensory processing. We propose a modified attention
mechanism that applies a non-linear transformation to the key vectors (K),
producing enriched representations (K') through a custom mapping function. This
Nonlinear Attention (NLA) mechanism enhances the representational capacity of
the attention layer, enabling the agent to learn more expressive feature
interactions. As a result, our model achieves significantly faster convergence
and improved training efficiency, while maintaining performance on par with the
baseline. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear attention
mechanisms to accelerate reinforcement learning without sacrificing
effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Celo, a learned optimizer with improved meta-generalization, outperforming VeLO and other optimizers with minimal training resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impractical resource demands of current learned optimizers like VeLO and improve meta-generalization for broader applicability.

Method: Identifies key architectural and procedural elements for meta-generalization and proposes evaluation metrics. Introduces Celo, a learned optimizer meta-trained for just 24 GPU hours.

Result: Celo achieves strong meta-generalization, outperforming tuned state-of-the-art optimizers on diverse out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Celo demonstrates that efficient meta-training and careful design can lead to highly effective learned optimizers without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Learned optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to hand-crafted
optimizers, with the potential to discover stronger learned update rules that
enable faster, hyperparameter-free training of neural networks. A critical
element for practically useful learned optimizers, that can be used
off-the-shelf after meta-training, is strong meta-generalization: the ability
to apply the optimizers to new tasks. Recent state-of-the-art work in learned
optimizers, VeLO (Metz et al., 2022), requires a large number of highly diverse
meta-training tasks along with massive computational resources, 4000 TPU
months, to achieve meta-generalization. This makes further improvements to such
learned optimizers impractical. In this work, we identify several key elements
in learned optimizer architectures and meta-training procedures that can lead
to strong meta-generalization. We also propose evaluation metrics to reliably
assess quantitative performance of an optimizer at scale on a set of evaluation
tasks. Our proposed approach, Celo, makes a significant leap in improving the
meta-generalization performance of learned optimizers and also outperforms
tuned state-of-the-art optimizers on a diverse set of out-of-distribution
tasks, despite being meta-trained for just 24 GPU hours.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Gradient Contribution (GC) method to address weight coupling in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by analyzing gradient conflicts and proposes the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework for combining MPNNs and GTs, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inefficiency and suboptimal partitioning in few-shot NAS methods caused by weight coupling and gradient conflicts.

Method: Proposes the GC method to compute gradient similarity and partition modules, and the UGAS framework to unify MPNN and GT searches.

Result: GC achieves SOTA in partitioning quality and efficiency; UGAS+GC outperforms manual and existing NAS methods.

Conclusion: The GC method and UGAS framework effectively address weight coupling and expand NAS capabilities, validated by experiments.

Abstract: To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into
multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational
inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address
this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a
novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding
layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules.
Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method
that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among
modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet
backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions
are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped
together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of
existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to
searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph
Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal
combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality
and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC
outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS
methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all
proposed methods.

TL;DR: CLaSP introduces a crossmodal embedding space between crystal structures and texts to improve intuitive materials exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abstract feature-based embedding spaces are not user-friendly, hindering efficient materials exploration.

Method: CLaSP uses contrastive learning with a dataset of 400,000 crystal structures and associated texts.

Result: The method enables intuitive text-based retrieval and visualization of crystal structures.

Conclusion: CLaSP effectively bridges crystal structures and textual descriptions for better materials discovery.

Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet
challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this
process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding
spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties
and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are
human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast
materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training
(CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces
between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings
that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between
crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via
user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of
sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP
leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and
corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for
training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal
structure screening and embedding space visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise harms classifier performance, making it crucial to understand deep learning's effectiveness in such scenarios.

Method: Derives error bounds for excess risk, uses independent block construction for statistical dependencies, and extends results to vector-valued outputs.

Result: Establishes theoretical bounds for excess risk, addressing statistical and approximation errors, and refines the latter for high-dimensional inputs.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into handling noisy labels in deep learning, improving robustness in classification tasks.

Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that label noise can lead to poor generalization
performance, negatively affecting classification accuracy. Therefore,
understanding the effectiveness of classifiers trained using deep neural
networks in the presence of noisy labels is of considerable practical
significance. In this paper, we focus on the error bounds of excess risks for
classification problems with noisy labels within deep learning frameworks. We
derive error bounds for the excess risk, decomposing it into statistical error
and approximation error. To handle statistical dependencies (e.g., mixing
sequences), we employ an independent block construction to bound the error,
leveraging techniques for dependent processes. For the approximation error, we
establish these theoretical results to the vector-valued setting, where the
output space consists of $K$-dimensional unit vectors. Finally, under the
low-dimensional manifold hypothesis, we further refine the approximation error
to mitigate the impact of high-dimensional input spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a mathematical perspective on learning velocity fields for flow matching, highlighting its simplicity and scalability in generative neural models.

Method: Review and analysis of techniques to learn velocity fields: transport plans (couplings), Markov kernels, and stochastic processes. Also explores applications in Bayesian inverse problems.

Result: Demonstrates how velocity fields can be characterized and learned, with broader applicability beyond coupling approaches.

Conclusion: Flow matching is versatile, scalable, and useful for tasks like Bayesian inverse problems, with connections to continuous normalizing flows and score matching.

Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their
simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of
curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then
the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a
target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper
reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the
velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We
show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport
plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels
and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling
approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow
matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the
definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally,
we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques,
which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiency in dataset construction and training due to growing real-world data, aiming to reduce redundancy and bias in annotation.

Method: Proposes Info-Coevolution, a framework for online selective annotation, leveraging task-specific models to coevolve models and data.

Result: Reduces annotation and training costs by 32% on ImageNet-1K, with potential for 50% reduction using semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: Info-Coevolution offers a scalable, bias-free solution for efficient dataset enhancement and training cost reduction.

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

Abstract: We introduce a practical, black-box framework termed Detection Augmenting

Our approach is applicable to all common parametric and non-parametric bandit

its versatility and scalability. We provide theoretical insights into DAL's
strong empirical performance on piecewise stationary and drift settings,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a formal definition for generalization along difficulty progressions and unify fragmented research efforts under the theme of induction.

Method: Proposes Inductive Learning, introducing model successors and adapting existing techniques to learn them.

Result: A formalized notion of inductive generalization and practical steps for implementing the new paradigm.

Conclusion: Advocates for restructuring research around induction and generalization, moving towards a unified effort focused on universal learning properties.

Abstract: The notion of generalization has moved away from the classical one defined in
statistical learning theory towards an emphasis on out-of-domain generalization
(OODG). There has been a growing focus on generalization from easy to hard,
where a progression of difficulty implicitly governs the direction of domain
shifts. This emerging regime has appeared in the literature under different
names, such as length/logical/algorithmic extrapolation, but a formal
definition is lacking. We argue that the unifying theme is induction -- based
on finite samples observed in training, a learner should infer an inductive
principle that applies in an unbounded manner. This work formalizes the notion
of inductive generalization along a difficulty progression and argues that our
path ahead lies in transforming the learning paradigm. We attempt to make
inroads by proposing a novel learning paradigm, Inductive Learning, which
involves a central concept called model successors. We outline practical steps
to adapt well-established techniques towards learning model successors. This
work calls for restructuring of the research discussion around induction and
generalization from fragmented task-centric communities to a more unified
effort, focused on universal properties of learning and computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretability in deep networks and the technical expertise required for SINDy.

Method: Integrates LLMs, VLMs, and RAG with SINDy to automate library generation and optimization.

Result: Achieves a 20% performance increase over alternatives in 198 models.

Conclusion: Al-Khwarizmi offers a scalable, automated solution for interpretable physical law discovery.

Abstract: Inferring physical laws from data is a central challenge in science and
engineering, including but not limited to healthcare, physical sciences,
biosciences, social sciences, sustainability, climate, and robotics. Deep
networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting
interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of
Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building
such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with
L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions.
However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires
significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This
work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law
discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy.
Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach
automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively
refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two
steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw
data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature
libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws
correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent
increase against the best-performing alternative.

Method: Propose distribution-based MIAs, shifting from instance-level scores to distribution-level statistics, and validate with an exemplar framework.

Result: Distribution-level statistics can detect unauthorized data usage in distilled models, even without direct memorization.

Conclusion: Distilled models are auditable for privacy violations using distribution-based MIAs, offering a viable alternative to discarding them.

Abstract: To detect unauthorized data usage in training large-scale generative models
(e.g., ChatGPT or Midjourney), membership inference attacks (MIA) have proven
effective in distinguishing a single training instance (a member) from a single
non-training instance (a non-member). This success is mainly credited to a
memorization effect: models tend to perform better on a member than a
non-member. However, we find that standard MIAs fail against distilled
generative models (i.e., student models) that are increasingly deployed in
practice for efficiency (e.g., ChatGPT 4o-mini). Trained exclusively on data
generated from a large-scale model (a teacher model), the student model lacks
direct exposure to any members (teacher's training data), nullifying the
memorization effect that standard MIAs rely on. This finding reveals a serious
privacy loophole, where generation-service providers could deploy a student
model whose teacher was potentially trained on unauthorized data, yet claim the
deployed model is clean because it was not directly trained on such data.
Hence, are distilled models inherently unauditable for upstream privacy
violations, and should we discard them when we care about privacy? We contend
no, as we uncover a memory chain connecting the student and teacher's member
data: the distribution of student-generated data aligns more closely with the
distribution of the teacher's members than with non-members, thus we can detect
unauthorized data usage even when direct instance-level memorization is absent.
This leads us to posit that MIAs on distilled generative models should shift
from instance-level scores to distribution-level statistics. We further propose
three principles of distribution-based MIAs for detecting unauthorized training
data through distilled generative models, and validate our position through an
exemplar framework. We lastly discuss the implications of our position.

TL;DR: LearnAlign, a gradient-alignment-based method, improves data efficiency in RL post-training for LLMs by intelligently selecting learnable reasoning data, reducing data needs while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the data inefficiency bottleneck in reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Method: Introduces LearnAlign, which selects learnable and representative training data based on success-rate-derived learnability, overcoming response-length bias in gradient norms.

Result: Reduces training data requirements significantly (e.g., by 1,000 points on GSM8K) with comparable or better performance (77.53% vs. 77.04%). Effective in staged RL settings.

Conclusion: Provides insights into data-efficient RL post-training and lays groundwork for optimizing reasoning data selection. Code will be released for future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce
the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the
learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training
data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even
improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces
data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%)
than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show
its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable
insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for
future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future
work, we will release code.

TL;DR: A universal framework for using oscillator networks as computational resources, leveraging the Kuramoto model for synchronization and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness nature's oscillatory dynamics in networks for computational processing and memory.

Method: Force the Kuramoto model with a nonlinear target-system, replace it with a trained feedback-loop, and analyze synchronization and learning.

Result: The network inherits Kuramoto model's efficient coupling and synchronization properties, enabling generic success and collective intelligence.

Conclusion: Oscillator networks can serve as a new class of information processing systems, leveraging natural dynamics.

Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory dynamics. In networks of coupled
oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external
input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present
a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational
resource. This computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for
phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear
target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained
feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly,
the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model,
where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the
number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. The latter
implies that the network is generically successful since the system learns via
sychronization. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network,
which describe a type of collective intelligence, can be explained using
Kuramoto model's order parameter. In summary, this work provides the foundation
for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information
processing systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent misalignment in fine-tuned large language models, using a minimal model to study and mitigate misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind emergent misalignment in fine-tuned models and why it generalizes beyond the training domain.

Method: Train a minimal model with 9 rank-1 adapters to study misalignment, extract a 'misalignment direction,' and use it to ablate misaligned behavior.

Result: Different misaligned models converge to similar representations; six adapters contribute to general misalignment, while two specialize in the fine-tuning domain.

Conclusion: Advancing understanding of emergent misalignment can help mitigate undesirable model behavior more broadly.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a
strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak
teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to
understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in
intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic
dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a
variance reduction perspective. For a strong student-weak teacher pair with
sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s,
\mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that
dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy
between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is
inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while
reduced by a factor of $\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of
discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for
W2S. Our analysis further casts light on the sample complexities and the
scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported by
experiments on synthetic regression problems, as well as real vision and NLP
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge cognitive science and neural network design by examining memory decay in artificial models.

Method: A quantitative framework evaluates recall probability by comparing hidden states to stored prototypes, scheduling reviews to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Experiments show neural networks exhibit human-like forgetting curves, with knowledge becoming robust through scheduled reviews.

Conclusion: Neural networks naturally emulate human memory decay, offering insights for continual learning algorithms.

Abstract: This study bridges cognitive science and neural network design by examining
whether artificial models exhibit human-like forgetting curves. Drawing upon
Ebbinghaus' seminal work on memory decay and principles of spaced repetition,
we propose a quantitative framework to measure information retention in neural
networks. Our approach computes the recall probability by evaluating the
similarity between a network's current hidden state and previously stored
prototype representations. This retention metric facilitates the scheduling of
review sessions, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting during deployment
and enhancing training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Our
experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons reveal human-like forgetting curves,
with knowledge becoming increasingly robust through scheduled reviews. This
alignment between neural network forgetting curves and established human memory
models identifies neural networks as an architecture that naturally emulates
human memory decay and can inform state-of-the-art continual learning
algorithms.

*Elias Kempf, Simon Schrodi, Max Argus, Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLIP's generalization depends on domain diversity and shared representations, with compositional generalization sometimes weaker than domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if CLIP can generalize to unseen domains or classes and identify factors affecting such generalization.

Method: Trained CLIP models on controlled distributions, analyzing domain diversity and class exposure.

Result: Domain diversity is crucial for generalization, but compositional generalization can lag due to suboptimal training subsets.

Conclusion: Successful generalization relies on shared intermediate representations and circuits.

Abstract: The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language
models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training
distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to
an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain
generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen
domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such
generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on
systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain
diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity
is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet
compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain
generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of
the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that
successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared
representations in intermediate layers and circuits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a DVFS-aware latency model for DNN inference on GPUs, reducing inference time by ‚â•66% and energy by ‚â•69% compared to CPU-DVFS models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CPU-DVFS models are inaccurate for GPU-based DNN inference, leading to suboptimal latency and energy optimization.

Method: Formulates DNN inference time via experiments, analyzes fitting parameters, and verifies the model by dividing DNNs into blocks.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in inference time (‚â•66%) and energy consumption (‚â•69%) compared to CPU-DVFS models.

Conclusion: The proposed GPU-specific DVFS model outperforms CPU-DVFS models, enhancing inference efficiency and energy savings.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep neural networks (DNNs) is inherently
accompanied by the problem of high computational costs. To tackle this
challenge, dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) is emerging as a promising
technology for balancing the latency and energy consumption of DNN inference by
adjusting the computing frequency of processors. However, most existing models
of DNN inference time are based on the CPU-DVFS technique, and directly
applying the CPU-DVFS model to DNN inference on GPUs will lead to significant
errors in optimizing latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose
a DVFS-aware latency model to precisely characterize DNN inference time on
GPUs. We first formulate the DNN inference time based on extensive experiment
results for different devices and analyze the impact of fitting parameters.
Then by dividing DNNs into multiple blocks and obtaining the actual inference
time, the proposed model is further verified. Finally, we compare our proposed
model with the CPU-DVFS model in two specific cases. Evaluation results
demonstrate that local inference optimization with our proposed model achieves
a reduction of no less than 66% and 69% in inference time and energy
consumption respectively. In addition, cooperative inference with our proposed
model can improve the partition policy and reduce the energy consumption
compared to the CPU-DVFS model.

*Yanting Miao, William Loh, Suraj Kothawade, Pacal Poupart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noise PPO is a minimalist RL algorithm that optimizes initial noise for text-to-image diffusion models, improving alignment and quality without complex modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for fine-tuning diffusion models are overly complex, relying on trajectory storage, reward models, or large datasets. The 'golden noise' hypothesis suggests simpler optimization is possible.

Method: Noise PPO freezes the pre-trained diffusion model and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator, avoiding trajectory storage or reward backpropagation.

Result: Noise optimization improves alignment and sample quality, especially at low inference steps, though benefits diminish with more steps.

Conclusion: The approach validates the golden noise hypothesis and demonstrates the practicality of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image
diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However,
existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full
sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference
datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden
noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield
superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that
leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a
prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory
storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive
experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently
improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most
significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps
increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present.
These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis
and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a one-pass reward modeling method for online RLHF, eliminating the need for historical data storage and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLHF relies on fixed datasets with limited coverage; online RLHF faces bottlenecks due to high computational and storage costs from iterative data integration.

Method: Formalizes RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem, using an online mirror descent algorithm with a tailored local norm for reward modeling.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show improved statistical and computational efficiency; experiments on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses key challenges in online RLHF, offering a practical and efficient solution for iterative model improvement.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown remarkable
success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences.
Traditional RLHF approaches rely on a fixed dataset, which often suffers from
limited coverage. To this end, online RLHF has emerged as a promising
direction, enabling iterative data collection and model improvement. Despite
its potential, this paradigm faces a key bottleneck: the requirement to
continuously integrate new data into the historical dataset and re-optimize the
model from scratch at each iteration, resulting in computational and storage
costs that grow linearly with the number of iterations. In this work, we
address this challenge by proposing a one-pass reward modeling method that does
not require storing the historical data and can be computed in constant time.
Specifically, we first formalize RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem
and design an online mirror descent algorithm with a tailored local norm to
replace the standard maximum likelihood estimation for reward modeling. We then
apply our method to various online RLHF settings, including passive data
collection, active data collection, and deployment-time adaptation. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that our method improves both statistical and
computational efficiency. Finally, we provide practical algorithms and conduct
experiments using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models on the
Ultrafeedback-binarized and Mixture2 datasets, validating the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

*Sujeevan Aseervatham, Achraf Kerzazi, Youn√®s Bennani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel defense method against backdoor attacks in AI models is proposed, detecting poisoned classes and extracting attack triggers without needing a clean dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses rely on clean datasets for statistical analysis, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed method trains a model on the given dataset, detects poisoned classes, extracts the attack trigger, and identifies poisoned instances.

Result: The method effectively detects backdoor attacks and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms (SCAn, ABL, AGPD) in evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach enhances explainability and practicality by not requiring a clean dataset, offering a robust defense against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks
targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves
normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker
embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the
training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training
data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The
objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label
while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense
mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these
methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute
statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios
where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset,
detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger
before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances
explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on
well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three
state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of reinforcement learning in infinite-horizon discounted
linear Markov decision processes (MDPs), and propose the first computationally
efficient algorithm achieving rate-optimal regret guarantees in this setting.
Our main idea is to combine two classic techniques for optimistic exploration:
additive exploration bonuses applied to the reward function, and artificial
transitions made to an absorbing state with maximal return. We show that,
combined with a regularized approximate dynamic-programming scheme, the
resulting algorithm achieves a regret of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\sqrt{d^3
(1 - \gamma)^{- 7 / 2} T})$, where $T$ is the total number of sample
transitions, $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is the discount factor, and $d$ is the feature
dimensionality. The results continue to hold against adversarial reward
sequences, enabling application of our method to the problem of imitation
learning in linear MDPs, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of self-attention in transformers limits scalability for long sequences, while hardware is optimized for small sequences. The goal is to leverage small transformers' efficiency for long sequences.

Method: The authors prove that a transformer with input length N can be simulated by O((N/M)¬≤) small transformers (input length M ‚â™ N), with O(N/M) sufficing in natural cases like average inputs or attention sinks.

Result: Theoretical results show worst-case complexity is O((N/M)¬≤), but practical scenarios reduce this to O(N/M).

Conclusion: Small transformers can efficiently simulate large ones, offering a scalable solution for long sequences with hardware-friendly implementations.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention prevents transformers from scaling
effectively to long input sequences. On the other hand, modern GPUs and other
specialized hardware accelerators are well-optimized for processing small input
sequences in transformers during both training and inference. A natural
question arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers
to deal with long input sequences?
  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large
transformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take
short input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any
transformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only
$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \ll N$, and that this cannot be
improved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural
scenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention
sinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.

Conclusion: The survey offers a comprehensive overview and deeper understanding of continual learning techniques for generative models, aiding future research and applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to
comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level
performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally
constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting
to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on
previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous
approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of
generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative
models, including large language models, multimodal large language models,
vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from
the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these
approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and
replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and
motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different
generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core
backbones, offering deeper insights into the field. The project page of this

Conclusion: LabTOP is an accurate, generalizable framework for lab test prediction, useful for clinical decision support and early detection.

Abstract: Lab tests are fundamental for diagnosing diseases and monitoring patient

results may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges,
we propose LabTOP, a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by
leveraging a language modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional
methods that estimate only a subset of lab tests or classify discrete value
ranges, LabTOP performs continuous numerical predictions for a diverse range of
lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three publicly available EHR datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods, including traditional machine
learning models and state-of-the-art large language models. We also conduct
extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of our design choices.
We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable framework
for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical
decision support and early detection of critical conditions.

Conclusion: The review aids in leveraging ML for small datasets in upstream bioprocessing and related domains.

Abstract: Data is crucial for machine learning (ML) applications, yet acquiring large
datasets can be costly and time-consuming, especially in complex,
resource-intensive fields like biopharmaceuticals. A key process in this
industry is upstream bioprocessing, where living cells are cultivated and
optimised to produce therapeutic proteins and biologics. The intricate nature
of these processes, combined with high resource demands, often limits data
collection, resulting in smaller datasets. This comprehensive review explores
ML methods designed to address the challenges posed by small data and
classifies them into a taxonomy to guide practical applications. Furthermore,
each method in the taxonomy was thoroughly analysed, with a detailed discussion
of its core concepts and an evaluation of its effectiveness in tackling small
data challenges, as demonstrated by application results in the upstream
bioprocessing and other related domains. By analysing how these methods tackle
small data challenges from different perspectives, this review provides
actionable insights, identifies current research gaps, and offers guidance for
leveraging ML in data-constrained environments.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring
fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem,
a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards
for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative
rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an
expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible
expected reward.
  Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social
welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the
minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the
social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the
optimal fair policy and that of the given policy.
  We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social
welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper
bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate
RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms
using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between
fairness and social welfare regrets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLIT algorithms balance accuracy and scalability in decision tree optimization by combining optimal and greedy methods, focusing on solving sub-problems near the leaves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for decision tree optimization are either fast but suboptimal (greedy) or accurate but slow (global optimum). The goal is to achieve both accuracy and scalability.

Method: Introduces SPLIT algorithms, which use sparse lookahead to solve sub-problems optimally near the root and greedily near the leaves, improving scalability without significant performance loss.

Result: SPLIT algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than optimal methods with negligible performance loss, and they enable scalable computation of near-optimal tree sets.

Conclusion: SPLIT achieves a balance between accuracy and scalability, advancing interpretable machine learning by efficiently producing high-quality decision trees.

Abstract: Decision tree optimization is fundamental to interpretable machine learning.
The most popular approach is to greedily search for the best feature at every
decision point, which is fast but provably suboptimal. Recent approaches find
the global optimum using branch and bound with dynamic programming, showing
substantial improvements in accuracy and sparsity at great cost to scalability.
An ideal solution would have the accuracy of an optimal method and the
scalability of a greedy method. We introduce a family of algorithms called
SPLIT (SParse Lookahead for Interpretable Trees) that moves us significantly
forward in achieving this ideal balance. We demonstrate that not all
sub-problems need to be solved to optimality to find high quality trees;
greediness suffices near the leaves. Since each depth adds an exponential
number of possible trees, this change makes our algorithms orders of magnitude
faster than existing optimal methods, with negligible loss in performance. We
extend this algorithm to allow scalable computation of sets of near-optimal
trees (i.e., the Rashomon set).

*Emiliano Seri, Marcello Petitta, Chryssoula Papaioannou, Nikolaos Katsoulas, Cristina Cornaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) for greenhouse microclimate modeling, showing their advantage over RNNs in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of greenhouse conditions is vital for optimizing both crop growth and renewable energy production in agrivoltaic systems.

Method: The study compares STGNNs and RNNs using datasets from two greenhouses, analyzing performance based on variable complexity.

Result: STGNNs outperform RNNs in complex scenarios (R¬≤=0.905 vs. 0.740), while RNNs excel in simpler setups.

Conclusion: Graph-based models like STGNNs are crucial for complex environments, paving the way for digital twins in agrivoltaic greenhouses.

Abstract: The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only
optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by
enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation.
However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to
ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study
introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks
(STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with
traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal
pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships
between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation
by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to
capture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. We benchmark
RNNs against directed STGNNs on two 15-min-resolution datasets from Volos
(Greece): a six-variable 2020 installation and a more complex eight-variable
greenhouse monitored in autumn 2024. In the simpler 2020 case the RNN attains
near-perfect accuracy, outperforming the STGNN. When additional drivers are
available in 2024, the STGNN overtakes the RNN ($R^{2}=0.905$ vs $0.740$),
demonstrating that explicitly modelling directional dependencies becomes
critical as interaction complexity grows. These findings indicate when
graph-based models are warranted and provide a stepping-stone toward digital
twins that jointly optimise crop yield and PV power in agrivoltaic greenhouses.

*Mohamed Hassouna, Clara Holzh√ºter, Malte Lehna, Matthijs de Jong, Jan Viebahn, Bernhard Sick, Christoph Scholz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Imitation Learning (IL) approach using soft labels and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) improves power grid congestion management, outperforming traditional methods by 17%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the operational challenges of renewable energy integration in power grids requires adaptive decision-making strategies.

Method: Proposes an IL method with soft labels from simulated topological actions and integrates GNNs for topology-aware representations.

Result: Outperforms hard-label IL and Deep Reinforcement Learning baselines, achieving 17% better performance than the expert agent.

Conclusion: The approach enhances grid management by capturing multiple viable actions and leveraging structural properties of power grids.

Abstract: The rising proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix introduces
significant operational challenges for power grid operators. Effective power
grid management demands adaptive decision-making strategies capable of handling
dynamic conditions. With the increase in complexity, more and more Deep
Learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to find suitable grid topologies
for congestion management. In this work, we contribute to this research by
introducing a novel Imitation Learning (IL) approach that leverages soft labels
derived from simulated topological action outcomes, thereby capturing multiple
viable actions per state. Unlike traditional IL methods that rely on hard
labels to enforce a single optimal action, our method constructs soft labels
that capture the effectiveness of actions that prove suitable in resolving grid
congestion. To further enhance decision-making, we integrate Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to encode the structural properties of power grids, ensuring
that the topology-aware representations contribute to better agent performance.
Our approach significantly outperforms its hard-label counterparts as well as
state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baseline agents. Most
notably, it achieves a 17% better performance compared to the greedy expert
agent from which the imitation targets were derived.

### [665] [Noise Resilient Over-The-Air Federated Learning In Heterogeneous Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19549)
*Zubair Shaban, Nazreen Shah, Ranjitha Prasad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoROTA-FL, a noise-resilient framework for federated learning in 6G networks, addressing challenges like noise, fading, and heterogeneity. It outperforms existing methods in stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven applications in 6G networks require efficient, privacy-preserving federated learning, but traditional OTA-FL suffers from noise, fading, and heterogeneity issues.

Method: Proposes NoROTA-FL, which uses controlled inexact solutions with proximal constraints to handle noise, stragglers, and heterogeneity, backed by theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: NoROTA-FL shows robust performance on real-world datasets (FEMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100), achieving stable convergence and higher accuracy than COTAF and FedProx.

Conclusion: NoROTA-FL effectively addresses key challenges in federated wireless networks, offering a practical solution for noisy and heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven applications
demand the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) to enable efficient and
privacy-preserving model training across distributed devices. Over-The-Air
Federated Learning (OTA-FL) exploits the superposition property of multiple
access channels, allowing edge users in 6G networks to efficiently share
spectral resources and perform low-latency global model aggregation. However,
these advantages come with challenges, as traditional OTA-FL techniques suffer
due to the joint effects of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at the server,
fading, and both data and system heterogeneity at the participating edge
devices. In this work, we propose the novel Noise Resilient Over-the-Air
Federated Learning (NoROTA-FL) framework to jointly tackle these challenges in
federated wireless networks. In NoROTA-FL, the local optimization problems find
controlled inexact solutions, which manifests as an additional proximal
constraint at the clients. This approach provides robustness against
straggler-induced partial work, heterogeneity, noise, and fading. From a
theoretical perspective, we leverage the zeroth- and first-order inexactness
and establish convergence guarantees for non-convex optimization problems in
the presence of heterogeneous data and varying system capabilities.
Experimentally, we validate NoROTA-FL on real-world datasets, including
FEMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating its robustness in noisy and
heterogeneous environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as
COTAF and FedProx, NoROTA-FL achieves significantly more stable convergence and
higher accuracy, particularly in the presence of stragglers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) is effective for BrainAGE estimation in stroke patients, outperforming single-site models and showing strong associations with vascular risk factors and functional outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in training BrainAGE models with large datasets, this study evaluates FL for BrainAGE estimation in stroke patients and its clinical relevance.

Method: Used FLAIR images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 centers, comparing centralized learning, FL, and single-site learning. Examined associations with vascular risk factors and functional outcomes.

Result: FL outperformed single-site models, with BrainAGE linked to diabetes mellitus and predictive of post-stroke recovery. Centralized learning was most accurate.

Conclusion: FL enables accurate BrainAGE predictions without data centralization, proving valuable for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

### [667] [Robust Hallucination Detection in LLMs via Adaptive Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07863)
*Mengjia Niu, Hamed Haddadi, Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HaMI improves hallucination detection in LLMs by adaptively selecting and learning critical tokens, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder deployment; current detectors rely on fixed token representations, limiting performance on free-form text.

Method: Proposes HaMI, a multiple instance learning approach for adaptive token selection and joint optimization of hallucination detection.

Result: HaMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: HaMI offers a robust solution for detecting hallucinations in diverse LLM-generated text.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety
concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination
detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain
truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the
performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal
representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working
on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of
hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that
enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and
learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We
achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination
detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level
representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of
token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse
forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show
that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### [668] [ScaleGNN: Towards Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive High-order Neighboring Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15920)
*Xiang Li, Jianpeng Qi, Haobing Liu, Yuan Cao, Guoqing Chao, Zhongying Zhao, Junyu Dong, Yanwei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleGNN addresses scalability and over-smoothing in GNNs by adaptively fusing multi-level graph features, using neighbor matrices and a masking mechanism for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with scalability and over-smoothing on large graphs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ScaleGNN constructs per-order neighbor matrices, uses a fusion module, and employs LCS-based masking to filter irrelevant neighbors.

Result: ScaleGNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in accuracy and efficiency on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ScaleGNN provides a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node
relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs
face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure
both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large
neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the
over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node
representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To
tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively
fuses multi-level graph features for both scalable and effective graph
learning. ScaleGNN first constructs per-order neighbor matrices that capture
only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy
of conventional aggregation. A learnable fusion module then selectively
integrates these features, emphasizing the most informative high-order
neighbors. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a
Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less
relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful
information is aggregated. In addition, a task-aware feature fusion strategy
dynamically balances low- and high-order information, preserving both local
detail and global context without incurring excessive complexity. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.

*Winston Chen, Trenton Chang, Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD for small treatment effects under non-adherence. LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network, improves CFD by jointly modeling nuisance parameters, reducing estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored variance differences between SBD and CFD in estimating treatment effects under non-adherence, and to improve estimation accuracy.

Method: Theoretical and empirical comparison of SBD and CFD, introduction of LobsterNet for joint nuisance parameter modeling in CFD.

Result: CFD outperforms SBD in low-effect scenarios; LobsterNet reduces estimation error in semi-synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling (via LobsterNet) enhances treatment effect estimation under non-adherence.

Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment
decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to
their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the
conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the
treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these
approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the
literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD
yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment
assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in
patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple
nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that
implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically,
LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and
real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared
nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation
under non-adherence.

*Muhamed Amin, Bernard R. Brooks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Boltzmann classifier is a distance-based probabilistic algorithm that provides interpretable outputs. It outperforms traditional methods in molecular activity prediction, oxidation state classification, and breast cancer diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a classifier that offers interpretable, physically meaningful probabilities, unlike traditional models with hard decisions or uncalibrated outputs.

Method: The classifier assigns class probabilities based on average distances to nearest neighbors within each class, leveraging the Boltzmann distribution.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in molecular activity prediction, oxidation state classification, and breast cancer diagnosis, often outperforming standard models.

Conclusion: The Boltzmann classifier is a robust, interpretable alternative for scientific domains, bridging classification and regression with meaningful outputs.

Abstract: We present the Boltzmann classifier, a novel distance based probabilistic
classification algorithm inspired by the Boltzmann distribution. Unlike
traditional classifiers that produce hard decisions or uncalibrated
probabilities, the Boltzmann classifier assigns class probabilities based on
the average distance to the nearest neighbors within each class, providing
interpretable, physically meaningful outputs. We evaluate the performance of
the method across three application domains: molecular activity prediction,
oxidation state classification of transition metal complexes, and breast cancer
diagnosis. In the molecular activity task, the classifier achieved the highest
accuracy in predicting active compounds against two protein targets, with
strong correlations observed between the predicted probabilities and
experimental pIC50 values. For metal complexes, the classifier accurately
distinguished between oxidation states II and III for Fe, Mn, and Co, using
only metal-ligand bond lengths extracted from crystallographic data, and
demonstrated high consistency with known chemical trends. In the breast cancer
dataset, the classifier achieved 97% accuracy, with low confidence predictions
concentrated in inherently ambiguous cases. Across all tasks, the Boltzmann
classifier performed competitively or better than standard models such as
logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and k-nearest
neighbors. Its probabilistic outputs were found to correlate with continuous
physical or biological properties, highlighting its potential utility in both
classification and regression contexts. The results suggest that the Boltzmann
classifier is a robust and interpretable alternative to conventional machine
learning approaches, particularly in scientific domains where underlying
structure property relationships are important.

*Jihwan Oh, Murad Aghazada, Se-Young Yun, Taehyeon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve LLMs' bargaining skills using utility-based feedback, a new benchmark (BargainArena), and human-aligned metrics. Results show LLMs often misalign with human preferences but improve with structured feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack real-world bargaining complexity, limiting LLMs' strategic depth and adaptation to human factors.

Method: Proposes BargainArena (6 scenarios), utility-based metrics, and a feedback mechanism for iterative LLM refinement.

Result: LLMs often misalign with human preferences; structured feedback improves strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLMs' bargaining capabilities, aligning them better with human strategies through iterative feedback.

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges
for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and
adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture
this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in
realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on
utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a
novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive
practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2)
human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility
theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly
reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured
feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining
strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning
(ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental
results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with
human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly
improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware
reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CodeV-R1 is an RLVR framework for training LLMs to generate Verilog from natural language, addressing challenges like verification, data scarcity, and computation costs. It achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend RLVR to EDA for Verilog generation from NL, overcoming challenges like lack of verification environments, scarce NL-code pairs, and high RLVR costs.

Method: Develops a testbench generator, round-trip data synthesis, and a two-stage training pipeline (distillation + adaptive DAPO RLVR).

Result: CodeV-R1-7B achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on benchmarks, outperforming prior SOTA by 12~20%.

Conclusion: CodeV-R1 advances Verilog generation, with released resources to aid EDA and LLM research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit,
automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical
problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially
automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog
from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges:
the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of
high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To
this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog
generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that
performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we
propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog
snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency
via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a
high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training
pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by
adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by
adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves
68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding
the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training
pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

*Andre He, Daniel Fried, Sean Welleck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates if GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm for language models, merely sharpens the model's distribution around solvable problems. It identifies a rank bias in GRPO, introduces unlikeliness reward to mitigate it, and improves performance in theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if GRPO's reinforcement learning approach genuinely enhances language model reasoning or just sharpens existing capabilities, using formal theorem proving as a test case.

Method: Identifies a degenerate rank bias in GRPO, introduces unlikeliness reward to up-weight rare correct solutions, and adjusts hyperparameters like updates per batch.

Result: Unlikeliness reward mitigates rank bias, improving pass@N performance. The revised GRPO recipe achieves competitive results on the miniF2F-test benchmark.

Conclusion: The study reveals GRPO's limitations, proposes effective mitigations, and demonstrates improved performance in theorem proving, offering a revised training pipeline.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is emerging as a primary driver for improving language
model reasoning capabilities. A fundamental question is whether current
reinforcement learning algorithms -- such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), the de facto standard algorithm used to improve language model
reasoning -- merely sharpen the base model's distribution around problems it
can already solve. We investigate this question in the context of formal
theorem proving, which has access to a perfect verifier. We identify a
degenerate rank bias in GRPO in which highly probable trajectories are
reinforced and rare ones are neglected. This results in distribution
sharpening: the model can solve some problems with fewer samples, but
underperforms simply sampling more solutions from the original model. To
overcome GRPO's rank bias we introduce unlikeliness reward, a simple method for
explicitly up-weighting rare but correct solutions. We show that unlikeliness
reward mitigates rank bias and improves pass@$N$ across a large range of $N$ in
both synthetic and real theorem proving settings. We also uncover an unexpected
link between rank bias and a seemingly mundane hyperparameter -- the number of
updates per batch -- that leads to a second, complementary mitigation. We
combine our insights into a revised GRPO training recipe for formal theorem
proving, yielding an open pipeline that achieves competitive performance to
DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark. We release our
implementation at https://github.com/AndreHe02/rewarding-unlikely-release

*Pau Vilimelis Aceituno, Jack William Miller, Noah Marti, Youssef Farag, Victor Boussange*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the trade-off in training autoregressive models for dynamical systems, showing how the training horizon affects the loss landscape and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the choice of training horizon impacts the performance and convergence of autoregressive models in forecasting dynamical systems.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the loss landscape's geometry based on training horizon, validated through numerical experiments.

Result: For chaotic systems, loss roughness grows exponentially with horizon; for limit cycles, it grows linearly. Long-horizon training generalizes better to short-term forecasts.

Conclusion: The study provides a principled approach for selecting training horizons in autoregressive forecasting models.

Abstract: When training autoregressive models to forecast dynamical systems, a critical
question arises: how far into the future should the model be trained to
predict? Too short a horizon may miss long-term trends, while too long a
horizon can impede convergence due to accumulating prediction errors. In this
work, we formalize this trade-off by analyzing how the geometry of the loss
landscape depends on the training horizon. We prove that for chaotic systems,
the loss landscape's roughness grows exponentially with the training horizon,
while for limit cycles, it grows linearly, making long-horizon training
inherently challenging. However, we also show that models trained on long
horizons generalize well to short-term forecasts, whereas those trained on
short horizons suffer exponentially (resp. linearly) worse long-term
predictions in chaotic (resp. periodic) systems. We validate our theory through
numerical experiments and discuss practical implications for selecting training
horizons. Our results provide a principled foundation for hyperparameter
optimization in autoregressive forecasting models.

*Sebastian Schmidt, Prasanga Dhungel, Christoffer L√∂ffler, Bj√∂rn Nieth, Stephan G√ºnnemann, Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework predicts sample importance using minimal training data, enabling efficient data pruning without full initial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large models is computationally expensive due to massive datasets. Existing pruning methods require full training, negating efficiency gains.

Method: Introduces importance score extrapolation using k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks, trained on a small data subset.

Result: Effective for 2 pruning methods, 4 datasets, and 3 training paradigms, showing promise for scaling expensive tasks like pruning.

Conclusion: Score extrapolation is a scalable solution for reducing computational costs in data pruning and related tasks.

Abstract: Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning
techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving
model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a
full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any
efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires
training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in
this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately
predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from
this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2
state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training
paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate
that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score
calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KCES is a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework for GNNs that uses Graph Kernel Complexity to identify and prune adversarial edges, improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses often rely on heuristics, overfit, or are computationally expensive.

Method: KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC) to score edges, pruning those with high scores (likely adversarial) to enhance robustness.

Result: KCES improves GNN robustness, outperforms baselines, and integrates well with other defenses.

Conclusion: KCES provides a principled, efficient solution for securing GNNs against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

### [678] [CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13064)
*Kai Tang, Ji Zhang, Hua Meng, Minbo Ma, Qi Xiong, Fengmao Lv, Jie Xu, Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoIFNet unifies imputation and forecasting for robust multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) with missing values, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing values in MTSF degrade accuracy; prior impute-then-forecast methods are suboptimal due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives.

Method: CoIFNet uses Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies robust to missing values.

Result: CoIFNet outperforms state-of-the-art by 24.40% (23.81%) at high missing rates and improves efficiency by 4.3√ó (memory) and 2.1√ó (time).

Conclusion: CoIFNet effectively addresses missing values in MTSF, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad
applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics.
Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human
errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ
an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to
error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address
this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network
(CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve
robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the
observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them
sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion
(CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing
values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning
objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through
extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across
diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art
method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a
point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency
by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and
$\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively. Our code is available at:

### [679] [Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13593)
*Hen Davidov, Gilad Freidkin, Shai Feldman, Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to estimate the time-to-unsafe-sampling in LLMs using survival analysis and conformal prediction, with an adaptive sampling strategy for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsafe responses in well-aligned LLMs are rare, making direct estimation impractical due to large data requirements.

Method: Frames the problem as survival analysis, uses conformal prediction for calibrated lower bounds, and optimizes sampling allocation via convex optimization.

Result: Improved statistical efficiency and practical utility for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

Conclusion: The method provides a reliable way to quantify safety risks in LLMs with limited sampling budgets.

Abstract: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number
of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g.,
toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe
responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only
once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating
time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a
prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic
sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an
unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved
in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly
challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of
survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound
(LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent
advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive,
per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The
objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to
reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to
improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling
budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our
theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for
safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

*Md Abrar Jahin, Adiba Abid, M. F. Mridha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QCL-MixNet is a quantum-informed contrastive learning framework with dynamic mixup for robust classification in imbalanced tabular data, outperforming 20 state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing drawbacks of conventional methods (overfitting, label noise, poor generalization) in handling class-imbalanced tabular data for expert systems.

Method: Integrates quantum entanglement-inspired layers, kNN-guided dynamic mixup, and a hybrid loss function for improved feature interaction and minority class representation.

Result: Outperforms 20 baselines in macro-F1 and recall on 18 real-world datasets, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: QCL-MixNet sets a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling, supported by theoretical robustness and expressiveness.

Abstract: Expert systems often operate in domains characterized by class-imbalanced
tabular data, where detecting rare but critical instances is essential for
safety and reliability. While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive
learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions,
they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor
generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose
QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented
with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification
under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum
Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through
sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup
strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically
similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid
loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning,
triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class
compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18
real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that
QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep
learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial
margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each
architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark
for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems. Theoretical analyses
reinforce its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares two AI approaches: DeepSeek-V3, a large-scale LLM, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework for clinical data. NetraAI combines contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient subgroups, achieving high accuracy with few features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for stable, interpretable AI in clinical settings, especially for small datasets, by combining dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning.

Method: NetraAI uses contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to embed features in a metric space and identify stable subgroups. An LLM Strategist acts as a meta-evolutionary layer to guide discovery.

Result: NetraAI transformed weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers for schizophrenia, depression, and pancreatic cancer, using only a few features.

Conclusion: NetraAI offers a reliable, explainable AI framework for clinical discovery, aligning with emerging paradigms like JEPA and advancing adaptive, self-reflective AI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel knowledge distillation framework uses a non-fine-tuned pre-trained NNP as a teacher to generate training data, reducing DFT calculations by 10x and achieving faster MD simulations without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods fine-tune NNPs, increasing energy barriers and limiting high-energy structure data. A gentler approach is needed for stable MD simulations.

Method: Two-stage training: student NNP trained with off-the-shelf teacher data, then fine-tuned with a smaller DFT dataset.

Result: Achieves comparable/superior accuracy, reduces DFT calculations by 10x, and speeds up inference by 106x.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, accurate MD simulations with fewer resources.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, the resulting student NNP achieves up to
106x speedup in inference compared to the teacher NNP, enabling significantly
faster and more efficient MD simulations.

*Jo√£o G. Ribeiro, Yaniv Oren, Alberto Sardinha, Matthijs Spaan, Francisco S. Melo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RecBayes is a novel method for ad hoc teamwork under partial observability, identifying tasks and teams from observations alone without needing environment states or teammate actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ad hoc teamwork in partially observable environments without relying on full observability or teammate actions.

Method: Uses a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained on past experiences to identify known teams and tasks from partial observations.

Result: Effective in large-scale environments (up to 1M states and 2^125 observations) and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: RecBayes is a scalable and effective solution for ad hoc teamwork under partial observability.

Abstract: This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under
partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to
environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any
stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates.
We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past
experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and
tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as
PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some
stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or
both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the
environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al.,
2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes
is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either
states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the
multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up
to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at
identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations
alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks
effectively.

TL;DR: T-Coop-UCB is a decentralized algorithm for multi-agent systems to learn threshold-activated rewards and avoid decoys, outperforming baselines in reward and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of threshold-activated rewards and decoys in cooperative multi-agent systems, where prior work assumes individually attainable rewards.

Method: Introduces T-Coop-UCB, enabling agents to jointly learn activation thresholds and reward distributions without centralized control.

Result: Empirical results show T-Coop-UCB outperforms baselines in cumulative reward, regret, and coordination, achieving near-Oracle performance.

Conclusion: Joint threshold learning and decoy avoidance are crucial for scalable, decentralized cooperation in complex multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent systems often face tasks that require coordinated
actions under uncertainty. While multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems provide a
powerful framework for decentralized learning, most prior work assumes
individually attainable rewards. We address the challenging setting where
rewards are threshold-activated: an arm yields a payoff only when a minimum
number of agents pull it simultaneously, with this threshold unknown in
advance. Complicating matters further, some arms are decoys - requiring
coordination to activate but yielding no reward - introducing a new challenge
of wasted joint exploration. We introduce Threshold-Coop-UCB (T-Coop-UCB), a
decentralized algorithm that enables agents to jointly learn activation
thresholds and reward distributions, forming effective coalitions without
centralized control. Empirical results show that T-Coop-UCB consistently
outperforms baseline methods in cumulative reward, regret, and coordination
metrics, achieving near-Oracle performance. Our findings underscore the
importance of joint threshold learning and decoy avoidance for scalable,
decentralized cooperation in complex multi-agent

TL;DR: A novel distributed hybrid algorithm optimizes multi-energy scheduling for decentralized resources, balancing private and collective objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of distributed energy resources and sector coupling necessitates efficient coordination methods for decentralized energy optimization.

Method: A distributed hybrid algorithm combining gossiping heuristics and local search to optimize energy scheduling across multiple sectors.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-optimal global solutions while respecting economic and technical constraints, validated in electrical and gas-based test cases.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses multi-energy scheduling, ensuring stakeholder goals and technical feasibility.

Abstract: With the rise of distributed energy resources and sector coupling,
distributed optimization can be a sensible approach to coordinate decentralized
energy resources. Further, district heating, heat pumps, cogeneration, and
sharing concepts like local energy communities introduce the potential to
optimize heating and electricity output simultaneously. To solve this issue, we
tackle the distributed multi-energy scheduling optimization problem, which
describes the optimization of distributed energy generators over multiple time
steps to reach a specific target schedule. This work describes a novel
distributed hybrid algorithm as a solution approach. This approach is based on
the heuristics of gossiping and local search and can simultaneously optimize
the private objective of the participants and the collective objective,
considering multiple energy sectors. We show that the algorithm finds globally
near-optimal solutions while protecting the stakeholders' economic goals and
the plants' technical properties. Two test cases representing pure electrical
and gas-based technologies are evaluated.

*Aijing Kong, Chengkai Xu, Xian Wu, Xinbo Chen, Peng Hang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A framework for vehicle platoon reorganization in emergencies uses reinforcement learning and coalition games, reducing collision rates and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing vehicle platoon response to emergencies by optimizing reorganization processes.

Method: Uses a reinforcement-learning-based platoon distribution model with risk potential fields, coalition-game-based decision-making, and a graph-theory-based Platoon Disposition Index (PDI).

Result: Reduces collision rates, improves driving efficiency, and decreases reorganization time with PDI.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances platoon reorganization in emergencies, outperforming baseline models.

Abstract: To enhance the ability for vehicle platoons to respond to emergency
scenarios, a platoon distribution reorganization decision-making framework is
proposed. This framework contains platoon distribution layer, vehicle
cooperative decision-making layer and vehicle planning and control layer.
Firstly, a reinforcement-learning-based platoon distribution model is
presented, where a risk potential field is established to quantitatively assess
driving risks, and a reward function tailored to the platoon reorganization
process is constructed. Then, a coalition-game-based vehicle cooperative
decision-making model is put forward, modeling the cooperative relationships
among vehicles through dividing coalitions and generating the optimal decision
results for each vehicle. Additionally, a novel graph-theory-based Platoon
Disposition Index (PDI) is incorporated into the game reward function to
measure the platoon's distribution state during the reorganization process, in
order to accelerating the reorganization process. Finally, the validation of
the proposed framework is conducted in two high-risk scenarios under random
traffic flows. The results show that, compared to the baseline models, the
proposed method can significantly reduce the collision rate and improve driving
efficiency. Moreover, the model with PDI can significantly decrease the platoon
formation reorganization time and improve the reorganization efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACCA, a comprehensive setting for evaluating agent adaptation in multi-agent systems, and proposes MRDG, a method to model teammates and opponents effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the complexity of adapting agents to new multi-agent systems with diverse tasks, environments, and unknown teammates/opponents.

Method: Proposes Multi-Retrieval and Dynamic Generation (MRDG) with positional encoders, hypernetwork modules, and viewpoint alignment.

Result: MRDG outperforms baselines in benchmark scenarios (SMAC, Overcooked-AI, Melting Pot) for robust collaboration and competition.

Conclusion: MRDG enhances agent adaptability in diverse multi-agent settings, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges,
necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions
with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly
complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent
reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on
these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent
Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to
generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both
unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and
environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against
unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and
Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents
using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional
encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents'
learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module
harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents
with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC,
Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust
collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing
established baselines. Our code is available at:

*Arpitha Srivathsa Malavalli, Karthik Sama, Janvi Chhabra, Pooja Bassin, Srinath Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a nature-inspired approach to design sustainable behavioral interventions by incorporating resilience, ensuring long-term effectiveness in societal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on sustainability in behavioral interventions, aiming for resilient outcomes in complex societal challenges like public health and eco-friendly behavior.

Method: Uses a nature-inspired postulate (lower energy states = greater resilience) as a regularization mechanism in intervention optimization, tested via an agent-based simulation of commuter choices.

Result: The energy-based approach ensures interventions align with agents' motivators, leading to resilient behavioral states, demonstrated in the simulation.

Conclusion: Incorporating resilience into intervention design through energy-based principles enhances sustainability and long-term effectiveness of behavioral nudges.

Abstract: Addressing complex societal challenges, such as improving public health,
fostering honesty in workplaces, or encouraging eco-friendly behaviour requires
effective nudges to influence human behaviour at scale. Intervention science
seeks to design such nudges within complex societal systems. While
interventions primarily aim to shift the system toward a desired state, less
attention is given to the sustainability of that state, which we define in
terms of resilience: the system's ability to retain the desired state even
under perturbations. In this work, we offer a more holistic perspective to
intervention design by incorporating a nature-inspired postulate i.e., lower
energy states tend to exhibit greater resilience, as a regularization mechanism
within intervention optimization to ensure that the resulting state is also
sustainable. Using a simple agent-based simulation where commuters are nudged
to choose eco-friendly options (e.g., cycles) over individually attractive but
less eco-friendly ones (e.g., cars), we demonstrate how embedding lower energy
postulate into intervention design induces resilience. The system energy is
defined in terms of motivators that drive its agent's behaviour. By inherently
ensuring that agents are not pushed into actions that contradict their
motivators, the energy-based approach helps design effective interventions that
contribute to resilient behavioural states.

*Kangwei Qi, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Qiang Fan, Jiangzhou Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DRL framework for RIS-assisted VEC systems to optimize power allocation and phase-shift, outperforming existing schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obstacles degrade VEC communication; RIS provides an alternative path, but optimizing system performance is challenging due to random task arrivals.

Method: A DRL framework combines MADDPG for power allocation and BCD for RIS phase-shift optimization.

Result: Simulations show the proposed scheme outperforms DDPG and random schemes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves RIS-assisted VEC system performance.

Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology that enables
vehicles to perform high-intensity tasks by executing tasks locally or
offloading them to nearby edge devices. However, obstacles such as buildings
may degrade the communications and incur communication interruptions, and thus
the vehicle may not meet the requirement for task offloading. Reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS) is introduced to support vehicle communication and
provide an alternative communication path. The system performance can be
improved by flexibly adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS. For RIS-assisted VEC
system where tasks arrive randomly, we design a control scheme that considers
offloading power, local power allocation and phase-shift optimization. To solve
this non-convex problem, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
framework that employs modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient
(MADDPG) approach to optimize the power allocation for vehicle users (VUs) and
block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to optimize the phase-shift of the
RIS. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the
centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme and random scheme.

Motivation: Existing surveys overlook communication's role in LLM-MAS coordination, prompting this comprehensive review to bridge the gap.

Method: Proposes a structured framework integrating system-level and internal communication, analyzing literature to identify key components and challenges.

Result: Identifies strengths, limitations, and challenges (e.g., efficiency, security) in LLM-MAS communication, offering future research directions.

Conclusion: Aims to clarify communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS to improve system design, scalability, and security.

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems have recently gained
significant attention due to their potential for complex, collaborative, and
intelligent problem-solving capabilities. Existing surveys typically categorize
LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) according to their application domains
or architectures, overlooking the central role of communication in coordinating
agent behaviors and interactions. To address this gap, this paper presents a
comprehensive survey of LLM-MAS from a communication-centric perspective.
Specifically, we propose a structured framework that integrates system-level
communication (architecture, goals, and protocols) with system internal
communication (strategies, paradigms, objects, and content), enabling a
detailed exploration of how agents interact, negotiate, and achieve collective
intelligence. Through an extensive analysis of recent literature, we identify
key components in multiple dimensions and summarize their strengths and
limitations. In addition, we highlight current challenges, including
communication efficiency, security vulnerabilities, inadequate benchmarking,
and scalability issues, and outline promising future research directions. This
review aims to help researchers and practitioners gain a clear understanding of
the communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS, thereby facilitating the design and
deployment of robust, scalable, and secure multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: A decentralized multi-agent model integrates communication and coordination via predictive coding, outperforming non-communicative models in tasks with divergent perceptual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simultaneously achieve symbol emergence for communication and coordinated behavior, addressing the gap in prior research that treated these separately.

Method: Integrates world models with communication channels, using bidirectional message exchange and contrastive learning for alignment. Tested on a two-agent trajectory drawing task.

Result: Outperforms non-communicative models, achieving near-centralized coordination levels and facilitating meaningful symbol systems.

Conclusion: Decentralized communication effectively supports coordination and shared environmental representations.

Abstract: We propose a fully decentralized multi-agent world model that enables both
symbol emergence for communication and coordinated behavior through temporal
extension of collective predictive coding. Unlike previous research that
focuses on either communication or coordination separately, our approach
achieves both simultaneously. Our method integrates world models with
communication channels, enabling agents to predict environmental dynamics,
estimate states from partial observations, and share critical information
through bidirectional message exchange with contrastive learning for message
alignment. Using a two-agent trajectory drawing task, we demonstrate that our
communication-based approach outperforms non-communicative models when agents
have divergent perceptual capabilities, achieving the second-best coordination
after centralized models. Importantly, our decentralized approach with
constraints preventing direct access to other agents' internal states
facilitates the emergence of more meaningful symbol systems that accurately
reflect environmental states. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of
decentralized communication for supporting coordination while developing shared
representations of the environment.

### [692] [ViFusion: In-Network Tensor Fusion for Scalable Video Feature Indexing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16258)
*Yisu Wang, Yixiang Zhu, Xinjiao Li, Yulong Zhang, Ruilong Wu, Dirk Kutscher*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: ViFusion is a communication-aware tensor fusion framework that enhances distributed video indexing by merging small feature tensors, improving throughput by 8-22x with comparable latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient data transfer in large-scale video feature indexing is hindered by heterogeneous hardware, diverse requirements, and network congestion, which existing methods fail to address adequately.

Method: ViFusion integrates in-network computation and a tensor fusion mechanism to consolidate small feature tensors into manageable units, optimizing distributed workflows.

Result: Deployment shows ViFusion boosts video retrieval system throughput by 8-22x while maintaining latency levels of state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: ViFusion effectively addresses inefficiencies in distributed video indexing, offering significant performance improvements without compromising latency.

Abstract: Large-scale video feature indexing in datacenters is critically dependent on
efficient data transfer. Although in-network computation has emerged as a
compelling strategy for accelerating feature extraction and reducing overhead
in distributed multimedia systems, harnessing advanced networking resources at
both the switch and host levels remains a formidable challenge. These
difficulties are compounded by heterogeneous hardware, diverse application
requirements, and complex multipath topologies. Existing methods focus
primarily on optimizing inference for large neural network models using
specialized collective communication libraries, which often face performance
degradation in network congestion scenarios.
  To overcome these limitations, we present ViFusion, a communication aware
tensor fusion framework that streamlines distributed video indexing by merging
numerous small feature tensors into consolidated and more manageable units. By
integrating an in-network computation module and a dedicated tensor fusion
mechanism within datacenter environments, ViFusion substantially improves the
efficiency of video feature indexing workflows. The deployment results show
that ViFusion improves the throughput of the video retrieval system by 8--22
times with the same level of latency as state-of-the-art systems.

### [693] [DT-UFC: Universal Large Model Feature Coding via Peaky-to-Balanced Distribution Transformation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16495)
*Changsheng Gao, Zijie Liu, Li Li, Dong Liu, Xiaoyan Sun, Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal feature coding method for large models, addressing distributional heterogeneity in features by transforming skewed distributions into a balanced target space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies focused on task- or model-specific feature coding, leaving universal feature coding for diverse large models unaddressed.

Method: Proposes a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation to align heterogeneous feature distributions without modifying downstream codecs.

Result: Validated on LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3, the method improves compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective universal feature coding, with source code released for future research.

Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential
for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing
transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted
task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature
coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we
present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large
models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally
incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,
features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while
those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This
distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned
peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed
feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation
is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of
heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this
alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can
effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate
our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and
SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will
be released for future research.

*Tobias Cord-Landwehr, Tobias Gburrek, Marc Deegen, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A spatio-spectral diarization pipeline combining TDOA-based segmentation and embedding-based clustering outperforms single-channel methods, handling overlapping speech and speaker movements effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of single-channel diarization and fully spatial pipelines, especially in handling overlapping speech and dynamic speaker positions.

Method: Combines TDOA-based segmentation (time-difference of arrival) with embedding-based clustering, requiring no multi-channel training data or microphone setup knowledge.

Result: Outperforms single-channel pyannote in overlapping speech scenarios and tracks speakers during position changes, adaptable to compact or distributed microphones.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is versatile, effective for overlapping speech and dynamic speaker tracking, and adaptable to various microphone setups.

Abstract: We propose a spatio-spectral, combined model-based and data-driven
diarization pipeline consisting of TDOA-based segmentation followed by
embedding-based clustering. The proposed system requires neither access to
multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement
of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed
microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of
overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly
outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a
compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones.
Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the
proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.

### [695] [EDNet: A Distortion-Agnostic Speech Enhancement Framework with Gating Mamba Mechanism and Phase Shift-Invariant Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16231)
*Doyeop Kwak, Youngjoon Jang, Seongyu Kim, Joon Son Chung*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EDNet is a distortion-agnostic speech enhancement framework combining masking and mapping via a gating mechanism, achieving strong performance across diverse distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world speech signals suffer from multiple distortions, but traditional methods (masking or mapping) are limited to specific scenarios.

Method: EDNet uses a Gating Mamba module (adaptive masking/mapping) and Phase Shift-Invariant Training for robust phase estimation.

Result: EDNet excels in denoising, dereverberation, bandwidth extension, and multi-distortion tasks.

Conclusion: EDNet is flexible and adaptable, outperforming traditional methods across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Speech signals in real-world environments are frequently affected by various
distortions such as additive noise, reverberation, and bandwidth limitation,
which may appear individually or in combination. Traditional speech enhancement
methods typically rely on either masking, which focuses on suppressing
non-speech components while preserving observable structure, or mapping, which
seeks to recover clean speech through direct transformation of the input. Each
approach offers strengths in specific scenarios but may be less effective
outside its target conditions. We propose the Erase and Draw Network (EDNet), a
distortion-agnostic speech enhancement framework designed to handle a broad
range of distortion types without prior assumptions about task or input
characteristics. EDNet consists of two main components: (1) the Gating Mamba
(GM) module, which adaptively combines masking and mapping through a learnable
gating mechanism that selects between suppression (Erase) and reconstruction
(Draw) based on local signal features, and (2) Phase Shift-Invariant Training
(PSIT), a shift tolerant supervision strategy that improves phase estimation by
enabling dynamic alignment during training while remaining compatible with
standard loss functions. Experimental results on denoising, dereverberation,
bandwidth extension, and multi distortion enhancement tasks show that EDNet
consistently achieves strong performance across conditions, demonstrating its
architectural flexibility and adaptability to diverse task settings.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: RapFlow-TTS is a fast, high-quality TTS model using velocity consistency in flow matching to reduce synthesis steps without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between speech quality and inference speed in ODE-based TTS models.

Method: Leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching, time interval scheduling, and adversarial learning.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity speech with 5-10x fewer synthesis steps than conventional methods.

Conclusion: RapFlow-TTS offers rapid, high-quality TTS synthesis by optimizing flow matching and reducing steps.

Abstract: We introduce RapFlow-TTS, a rapid and high-fidelity TTS acoustic model that
leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching (FM) training.
Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves
natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation
steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed. To address
this challenge, RapFlow-TTS enforces consistency in the velocity field along
the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with
fewer generation steps. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time
interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of
the few-step synthesis. Experimental results show that RapFlow-TTS achieves
high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis
steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: H-QuEST accelerates spoken term retrieval using TF-IDF and HNSW, improving speed without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated data and inefficiency of traditional methods like DTW in QbE-STD.

Method: Uses TF-IDF-based sparse representations and HNSW indexing with refinement.

Result: Significant speed improvements without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: H-QuEST is an efficient alternative to traditional QbE-STD methods.

Abstract: Query-by-example spoken term detection (QbE-STD) searches for matching words
or phrases in an audio dataset using a sample spoken query. When annotated data
is limited or unavailable, QbE-STD is often done using template matching
methods like dynamic time warping (DTW), which are computationally expensive
and do not scale well. To address this, we propose H-QuEST (Hierarchical
Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection), a novel framework that accelerates
spoken term retrieval by utilizing Term Frequency and Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF)-based sparse representations obtained through advanced audio
representation learning techniques and Hierarchical Navigable Small World
(HNSW) indexing with further refinement. Experimental results show that H-QuEST
delivers substantial improvements in retrieval speed without sacrificing
accuracy compared to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of whispered speech recognition combined with dialect variation using a low-range dataset and processing load.

Method: Uses a Mamba-based state-space model and four fine-tuned self-supervised models (Wav2Vec2, WavLM, HuBERT, Whisper) trained on whispered and normal speech data across Singaporean, US, and Irish dialects.

Result: Achieves best performance on wTIMIT and CHAINS datasets, demonstrating efficiency with low whispered data.

Conclusion: The Mamba-based model is highly efficient for simultaneous whispered and normal speech recognition, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Whispered speech recognition presents significant challenges for conventional
automatic speech recognition systems, particularly when combined with dialect
variation. However, utilizing an efficient method to solve this problem using a
low-range dataset and processing load is beneficial. This paper proposes a
solution using a Mamba-based state-space model and four fine-tuned
self-supervised models consisting of Wav2Vec2, WavLM, HuBERT, and Whisper to
address the dual challenges of whispered speech and dialect diversity. Based on
our knowledge, this represents the best performance reported on the wTIMIT and
CHAINS datasets for whispered speech recognition. We trained the models using
whispered and normal speech data across Singaporean, US, and Irish dialects.
The findings demonstrated that utilizing the proposed Mamba-based model could
work as a highly efficient model trained with low amounts of whispered data to
simultaneously work on whispered and normal speech recognition. The code for
this work is freely available.

Result: Achieves a 63% relative macro tcpWER improvement over the baseline and outperforms best results on NOTSOFAR-1 meeting data for geometry-independent systems.

Conclusion: The refinements in diarization, speech enhancement, and ASR significantly improve performance, demonstrating the system's effectiveness for multi-talker DASR.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-talker distant automatic speech
recognition (DASR) system we designed for the DASR task 1 of the CHiME-8
challenge. Our system performs speaker counting, diarization, and ASR. It
handles various recording conditions, from diner parties to professional
meetings and from two to eight speakers. We perform diarization first, followed
by speech enhancement, and then ASR as the challenge baseline. However, we
introduced several key refinements. First, we derived a powerful speaker
diarization relying on end-to-end speaker diarization with vector clustering
(EEND-VC), multi-channel speaker counting using enhanced embeddings from
EEND-VC, and target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD). For speech
enhancement, we introduced a novel microphone selection rule to better select
the most relevant microphones among the distributed microphones and
investigated improvements to beamforming. Finally, for ASR, we developed
several models exploiting Whisper and WavLM speech foundation models. We
present the results we submitted to the challenge and updated results we
obtained afterward. Our strongest system achieves a 63% relative macro tcpWER
improvement over the baseline and outperforms the challenge best results on the
NOTSOFAR-1 meeting evaluation data among geometry-independent systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A method for automatically localizing key PE therapy fidelity elements from session audio/transcripts using a fine-tuned audio-language model (Qwen2-Audio) with LoRA, achieving 5.3s MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual review of PE therapy sessions for fidelity is labor-intensive; automation can improve scalability for clinician training and quality assurance.

Method: Fine-tunes Qwen2-Audio with LoRA on 30s audio-transcript windows, using LLM-based prompting for fidelity labels (P1, P2, P3) and soft supervision for boundary prediction.

Result: Best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves 5.3s MAE on 313 PE sessions. Analyzes window size and LoRA rank effects.

Conclusion: Introduces a scalable framework for PE fidelity tracking, aiding clinician training and supervision.

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: S2ST-Omni is a novel framework for multilingual speech-to-speech translation, decomposing the task into speech-to-text translation and text-to-speech synthesis, leveraging pretrained models to reduce reliance on large parallel corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in high-quality multilingual speech-to-speech translation and reducing dependency on large-scale parallel speech corpora.

Method: Decomposes S2ST into S2TT and TTS, uses pretrained models (Whisper, Qwen 3.0), and introduces a speech adapter to bridge speech-text gaps. Streaming TTS ensures real-time responsiveness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the CVSS benchmark in translation quality.

Conclusion: S2ST-Omni is effective and superior for multilingual S2ST, offering scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multilingual speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to directly convert
spoken utterances from multiple source languages into fluent and intelligible
speech in a target language. Despite recent progress, several critical
challenges persist: 1) achieving high-quality S2ST remains a significant
obstacle; 2) most existing S2ST methods rely heavily on large-scale parallel
speech corpora, which are difficult and resource-intensive to obtain. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce S2ST-Omni, a novel, efficient, and scalable
framework tailored for multilingual speech-to-speech translation. Specifically,
we decompose S2ST into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech
synthesis (TTS). To enable high-quality S2TT while mitigating reliance on
large-scale parallel speech corpora, we leverage powerful pretrained models:
Whisper for robust audio understanding and Qwen 3.0 for advanced text
comprehension. A lightweight speech adapter is introduced to bridge the
modality gap between speech and text representations, facilitating effective
utilization of pretrained multimodal knowledge. To ensure both translation
accuracy and real-time responsiveness, we adopt a streaming speech generation
model in the TTS stage, which generates the target speech in an autoregressive
manner. Extensive experiments conducted on the CVSS benchmark demonstrate that
S2ST-Omni consistently surpasses several state-of-the-art S2ST baselines in
translation quality, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: ZipVoice offers a high-quality, efficient alternative to large-scale zero-shot TTS models.

Abstract: Existing large-scale zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models deliver high
speech quality but suffer from slow inference speeds due to massive parameters.
To address this issue, this paper introduces ZipVoice, a high-quality
flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS model with a compact model size and fast
inference speed. Key designs include: 1) a Zipformer-based flow-matching
decoder to maintain adequate modeling capabilities under constrained size; 2)
Average upsampling-based initial speech-text alignment and Zipformer-based text
encoder to improve speech intelligibility; 3) A flow distillation method to
reduce sampling steps and eliminate the inference overhead associated with
classifier-free guidance. Experiments on 100k hours multilingual datasets show
that ZipVoice matches state-of-the-art models in speech quality, while being 3
times smaller and up to 30 times faster than a DiT-based flow-matching
baseline. Codes, model checkpoints and demo samples are publicly available.

### [706] [Pixel-wise Modulated Dice Loss for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15744)
*Seyed Mohsen Hosseini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modified Dice loss (PM Dice loss) to address both class and difficulty imbalances in medical segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class and difficulty imbalances in medical segmentation tasks hinder neural network performance, with existing solutions being costly or ineffective.

Method: Introduces a pixel-level modulating term to the Dice loss, leveraging its class imbalance handling to also address difficulty imbalance with minimal computational cost.

Result: PM Dice loss outperforms other methods on three medical segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed PM Dice loss effectively tackles both class and difficulty imbalances, offering a simple yet superior solution.

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data
imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical
segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority
classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify
pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a
geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance
compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from
classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach
is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the
training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are
computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a
simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a
pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice
loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance.
Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the
proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other
methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

Result: It reduces peak GPU memory by up to 94%, maintains real-time generation, and matches full-cache accuracy.

Conclusion: InfiniPot-V enables efficient on-device streaming video assistants by eliminating the KV cache bottleneck.

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long
video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly
exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior
compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available
offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream
length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that
enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video
understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set
threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes
temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii)
keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four
open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks,
InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation,
and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By
dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge,
InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

*Zhe Wang, Yuhua Ru, Aladine Chetouani, Tina Shiang, Fang Chen, Fabian Bauer, Liping Zhang, Didier Hans, Rachid Jennane, William Ewing Palmer, Mohamed Jarraya, Yung Hsin Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Diffusion-based Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA) to improve robustness and interpretability in automated Knee Osteoarthritis grading by generating targeted counterfactuals using a diffusion model and SDE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inter-observer variability and deep learning model limitations near critical decision boundaries in KOA grading.

Method: Uses a diffusion model with SDE to generate counterfactuals, balancing classifier-informed boundary drive and manifold constraint, and employs self-corrective learning.

Result: Significantly improves classification accuracy on OAI and MOST datasets, aligns latent space with clinical KOA progression, and enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: DCA converts model uncertainty into a robust training signal, advancing accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostics.

Abstract: Automated grading of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) from radiographs is challenged
by significant inter-observer variability and the limited robustness of deep
learning models, particularly near critical decision boundaries. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based
Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA), which enhances model robustness and
interpretability by generating targeted counterfactual examples. The method
navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential
Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with
a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a
self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its
specific areas of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on the public
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)
datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves classification
accuracy across multiple model architectures. Furthermore, the method provides
interpretability by visualizing minimal pathological changes and revealing that
the learned latent space topology aligns with clinical knowledge of KOA
progression. The DCA framework effectively converts model uncertainty into a
robust training signal, offering a promising pathway to developing more
accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostic systems. Our code is available at

*Sanuwani Dayarathna, Himashi Peiris, Kh Tohidul Islam, Tien-Tsin Wong, Zhaolin Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A dual-domain learning framework integrates spatial and frequency domain features for improved multi-contrast MRI synthesis, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to model global intensity variations and retain finer details due to limitations in spatial or frequency domain features alone.

Method: Proposes a dual-domain framework with two denoising networks (spatial and frequency domains) trained mutually via a shared critic network, using an uncertainty-driven mask loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and improves downstream segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The dual-domain approach enhances MRI synthesis accuracy, demonstrating diagnostic value.

Abstract: Multi contrast MRI synthesis is inherently challenging due to the complex and
nonlinear relationships among different contrasts. Each MRI contrast highlights
unique tissue properties, but their complementary information is difficult to
exploit due to variations in intensity distributions and contrast specific
textures. Existing methods for multi contrast MRI synthesis primarily utilize
spatial domain features, which capture localized anatomical structures but
struggle to model global intensity variations and distributed patterns.
Conversely, frequency domain features provide structured inter contrast
correlations but lack spatial precision, limiting their ability to retain finer
details. To address this, we propose a dual domain learning framework that
integrates spatial and frequency domain information across multiple MRI
contrasts for enhanced synthesis. Our method employs two mutually trained
denoising networks, one conditioned on spatial domain and the other on
frequency domain contrast features through a shared critic network.
Additionally, an uncertainty driven mask loss directs the models focus toward
more critical regions, further improving synthesis accuracy. Extensive
experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA baselines, and the downstream
segmentation performance highlights the diagnostic value of the synthetic
results.

*Tom Hendriks, Gerrit Arends, Edwin Versteeg, Anna Vilanova, Maxime Chamberland, Chantal M. W. Tax*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an implicit neural representation (INR) framework for estimating Standard Model (SM) parameters in dMRI, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, noise robustness, and spatial upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Standard Model (SM) for dMRI faces challenges like parameter degeneracies and noise sensitivity, requiring extensive protocols. This work aims to improve estimation accuracy and robustness.

Method: The proposed method uses implicit neural representations (INRs) with spatial regularization via sinusoidal encoding of coordinates, evaluated on synthetic and in vivo data against cubic polynomials, neural networks, and nonlinear least squares.

Result: INRs show superior accuracy in SM parameter estimation, especially in low signal-to-noise conditions, and enable continuous spatial upsampling. The method is unsupervised, fast, and adaptable to varying protocols.

Conclusion: INRs are a promising tool for dMRI analysis, offering accuracy, robustness, and flexibility for interpreting diffusion MRI data.

Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive
investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter
aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal
water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature,
extensive acquisition protocols with multiple b-values and diffusion tensor
shapes are typically required to mitigate parameter degeneracies. Even then,
accurate estimation remains challenging due to noise. This work introduces a
novel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs),
which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the
input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo
datasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials,
supervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares. Results demonstrate
superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly
in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR
can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous
way, which is unattainable with linear or cubic interpolation. The INR is fully
unsupervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast
inference ($\sim$6 minutes), is robust to both Gaussian and Rician noise,
supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation
distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8 and
non-negativity constraints, and accommodates spatially varying acquisition
protocols caused by magnetic gradient non-uniformities. The combination of
these properties along with the possibility to easily adapt the framework to
other dMRI models, positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing
and interpreting diffusion MRI data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MoNetV2 improves 3D ultrasound reconstruction by fusing image and motion data, using multi-level consistency constraints and self-supervised strategies to reduce errors and enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning-based freehand 3D ultrasound methods struggle with cumulative drift and accuracy, especially in complex motion scenarios.

Method: Proposes MoNetV2 with a sensor-based temporal and multi-branch structure, online multi-level consistency constraints, and a self-supervised strategy to fuse image and motion data.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in reconstruction quality and generalizability across three large datasets.

Conclusion: MoNetV2 effectively addresses challenges in 3D ultrasound reconstruction, improving accuracy and adaptability to diverse scanning conditions.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) aims to provide sonographers with the
spatial relationships of anatomical structures, playing a crucial role in
clinical diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning-based freehand 3D US has made
significant advancements. It reconstructs volumes by estimating transformations
between images without external tracking. However, image-only reconstruction
poses difficulties in reducing cumulative drift and further improving
reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving complex motion
trajectories. In this context, we propose an enhanced motion network (MoNetV2)
to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of reconstruction under diverse
scanning velocities and tactics. First, we propose a sensor-based temporal and
multi-branch structure that fuses image and motion information from a velocity
perspective to improve image-only reconstruction accuracy. Second, we devise an
online multi-level consistency constraint that exploits the inherent
consistency of scans to handle various scanning velocities and tactics. This
constraint exploits both scan-level velocity consistency, path-level appearance
consistency, and patch-level motion consistency to supervise inter-frame
transformation estimation. Third, we distill an online multi-modal
self-supervised strategy that leverages the correlation between network
estimation and motion information to further reduce cumulative errors.
Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that MoNetV2 surpasses existing
methods in both reconstruction quality and generalizability performance across
three large datasets.

TL;DR: HistoStainAlign predicts IHC staining patterns from H&E images using deep learning, improving efficiency and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC staining is expensive and time-consuming; this study aims to provide a computational alternative using H&E images.

Method: A deep learning framework (HistoStainAlign) learns joint representations of H&E and IHC features via contrastive training, without patch-level annotations.

Result: Achieved weighted F1 scores of 0.735 (P53), 0.830 (PD-L1), and 0.723 (Ki-67) on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs.

Conclusion: HistoStainAlign shows promise as a pre-screening tool to prioritize cases for IHC staining, enhancing workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological
analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue
architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins
within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment
planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and
resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these
limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning
framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide
images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular
features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a
contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining
modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model
was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used
IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores
of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI:
0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC
stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive
alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a
baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive
learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the
potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping
prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.

*Ziran Zhu, Tongda Xu, Minye Huang, Dailan He, Xingtong Ge, Xinjie Zhang, Ling Li, Yan Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free algorithm to improve perceptual quality of image codecs with fast decoding, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free perceptual image codecs are slow, relying on time-consuming methods like diffusion inversion. This work aims to enhance decoding speed and quality without additional training.

Method: Introduces a training-free algorithm with implementations optimized for different decoding time budgets (‚âà0.1s, 0.1-10s, ‚â•10s). It improves speed and quality, works with non-differentiable codecs, and enables perception-distortion trade-offs.

Result: Reduces decoding time from 1 min to 0.1-10s with comparable perceptual quality. Outperforms HiFiC and MS-ILLM in FID and works with VTM, ELIC, and MS-ILLM.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves decoding speed and perceptual quality, offering a practical solution for existing codecs with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Training-free perceptual image codec adopt pre-trained unconditional
generative model during decoding to avoid training new conditional generative
model. However, they heavily rely on diffusion inversion or sample
communication, which take 1 min to intractable amount of time to decode a
single image. In this paper, we propose a training-free algorithm that improves
the perceptual quality of any existing codec with theoretical guarantee. We
further propose different implementations for optimal perceptual quality when
decoding time budget is $\approx 0.1$s, $0.1-10$s and $\ge 10$s. Our approach:
1). improves the decoding time of training-free codec from 1 min to $0.1-10$s
with comparable perceptual quality. 2). can be applied to non-differentiable
codec such as VTM. 3). can be used to improve previous perceptual codecs, such
as MS-ILLM. 4). can easily achieve perception-distortion trade-off.
Empirically, we show that our approach successfully improves the perceptual
quality of ELIC, VTM and MS-ILLM with fast decoding. Our approach achieves
comparable FID to previous training-free codec with significantly less decoding
time. And our approach still outperforms previous conditional generative model
based codecs such as HiFiC and MS-ILLM in terms of FID. The source code is
provided in the supplementary material.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes cross-domain training for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in teledermatology, combining dermatology and non-dermatology datasets to improve image quality management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor image quality in teledermatology reduces consultation effectiveness, but existing dermatology IQA research lacks large datasets and advanced methods.

Method: Created a new dermatology IQA database (Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial) and used cross-domain training with non-dermatology IQA datasets.

Result: Cross-domain training improves performance by leveraging larger datasets and diverse image distortions, enhancing teledermatology image quality.

Conclusion: Cross-domain IQA training addresses data limitations in dermatology, improving image quality management for remote consultations.

Abstract: Teledermatology has become a widely accepted communication method in daily
clinical practice, enabling remote care while showing strong agreement with
in-person visits. Poor image quality remains an unsolved problem in
teledermatology and is a major concern to practitioners, as bad-quality images
reduce the usefulness of the remote consultation process. However, research on
Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in dermatology is sparse, and does not leverage
the latest advances in non-dermatology IQA, such as using larger image
databases with ratings from large groups of human observers. In this work, we
propose cross-domain training of IQA models, combining dermatology and
non-dermatology IQA datasets. For this purpose, we created a novel dermatology
IQA database, Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial, using dermatology images from
several sources and having them annotated by a group of human observers. We
demonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across
domains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which
is the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of
image distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the
teledermatology process.

### [715] [From Coarse to Continuous: Progressive Refinement Implicit Neural Representation for Motion-Robust Anisotropic MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16210)
*Zhenxuan Zhang, Lipei Zhang, Yanqi Cheng, Zi Wang, Fanwen Wang, Haosen Zhang, Yue Yang, Yinzhe Wu, Jiahao Huang, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero, Zhifan Gao, Guang Yang, Peter J. Lally*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR) framework is proposed for motion-robust MRI, unifying motion correction, structural refinement, and volumetric synthesis to address hierarchical disruptions in slice-to-volume reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slice-to-volume reconstruction in MRI is challenging due to local detail loss, global structural aliasing, and volumetric anisotropy caused by motion and undersampling.

Method: PR-INR integrates a motion-aware diffusion module for coarse reconstruction, an implicit detail restoration module for local refinement, and a voxel continuous-aware representation module for inter-slice completion.

Result: PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction metrics and visual quality, demonstrating robustness across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The PR-INR framework effectively addresses motion and undersampling challenges in MRI, offering superior reconstruction and generalization.

Abstract: In motion-robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume
reconstruction is critical for recovering anatomically consistent 3D brain
volumes from 2D slices, especially under accelerated acquisitions or patient
motion. However, this task remains challenging due to hierarchical structural
disruptions. It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global
structural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we
propose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR)
framework. Our PR-INR unifies motion correction, structural refinement, and
volumetric synthesis within a geometry-aware coordinate space. Specifically, a
motion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric
reconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical
structures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that
performs residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual
features. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision.
Further, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as
a continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice
completion and high-frequency detail recovery. We evaluate PR-INR on five
public MRI datasets under various motion conditions (3% and 5% displacement),
undersampling rates (4x and 8x) and slice resolutions (scale = 5). Experimental
results demonstrate that PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative reconstruction metrics and visual quality. It further shows
generalization and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Using counterfactual images to improve anatomical segmentation in medical images by simulating disease-free appearances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation is challenging due to disease-altered appearances and ambiguous boundaries, risking misdiagnosis.

Method: Generate counterfactual images to simulate disease-free anatomy and use them for segmentation without modifying the model.

Result: Experiments on chest X-ray datasets show improved anatomical segmentation.

Conclusion: Counterfactual images enhance segmentation accuracy, supporting better clinical decisions.

Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images plays an important role in
the quantitative assessment of various diseases. However, accurate segmentation
becomes significantly more challenging in the presence of disease. Disease
patterns can alter the appearance of surrounding healthy tissues, introduce
ambiguous boundaries, or even obscure critical anatomical structures. As such,
segmentation models trained on real-world datasets may struggle to provide good
anatomical segmentation, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, we
generate counterfactual (CF) images to simulate how the same anatomy would
appear in the absence of disease without altering the underlying structure. We
then use these CF images to segment structures of interest, without requiring
any changes to the underlying segmentation model. Our experiments on two
real-world clinical chest X-ray datasets show that the use of counterfactual
images improves anatomical segmentation, thereby aiding downstream clinical
decision-making.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An interpretable deep learning method for automated gestational age calculation, using segmentation and distance maps, achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate gestational age estimation is crucial for fetal health, but traditional methods are unreliable or hard to obtain, and ultrasound-based approaches suffer from manual variability.

Method: The study introduces a deep learning-based approach with a novel segmentation architecture and distance maps to address dataset limitations and lack of segmentation masks.

Result: The method matches state-of-the-art performance while being simpler, suitable for resource-limited settings, and excels in femur endpoint estimation using distance maps.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable, automated solution for gestational age estimation, especially in settings with limited resources or annotated data.

Abstract: Being born small carries significant health risks, including increased
neonatal mortality and a higher likelihood of future cardiac diseases. Accurate
estimation of gestational age is critical for monitoring fetal growth, but
traditional methods, such as estimation based on the last menstrual period, are
in some situations difficult to obtain. While ultrasound-based approaches offer
greater reliability, they rely on manual measurements that introduce
variability. This study presents an interpretable deep learning-based method
for automated gestational age calculation, leveraging a novel segmentation
architecture and distance maps to overcome dataset limitations and the scarcity
of segmentation masks. Our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity, making it particularly
suitable for resource-constrained settings and with limited annotated data.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of distance maps is
particularly suitable for estimating femur endpoints.

TL;DR: VesselSDF introduces a novel framework using signed distance fields (SDFs) for robust vessel segmentation from sparse CT scans, outperforming existing methods by preserving geometric fidelity and connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scans is challenging due to thin, branching vessels and sparsity between imaging planes. Existing deep learning methods struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity.

Method: VesselSDF reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, representing each point by its signed distance to the nearest vessel surface. An adaptive Gaussian regularizer ensures smoothness and precise geometry.

Result: VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods, preserving vessel geometry and connectivity, and eliminating common SDF artifacts like floating segments.

Conclusion: VesselSDF enables more reliable vascular analysis in clinical settings by providing accurate vessel reconstructions with improved geometric fidelity.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scan slices remains
a significant challenge in medical imaging, particularly due to the thin,
branching nature of vessels and the inherent sparsity between imaging planes.
Existing deep learning approaches, based on binary voxel classification, often
struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity. To address this
challenge, we present VesselSDF, a novel framework that leverages signed
distance fields (SDFs) for robust vessel reconstruction. Our method
reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, where
each point in the volume is represented by its signed distance to the nearest
vessel surface. This continuous representation inherently captures the smooth,
tubular geometry of blood vessels and their branching patterns. We obtain
accurate vessel reconstructions while eliminating common SDF artifacts such as
floating segments, thanks to our adaptive Gaussian regularizer which ensures
smoothness in regions far from vessel surfaces while producing precise geometry
near the surface boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that
VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods and preserves vessel
geometry and connectivity, enabling more reliable vascular analysis in clinical
settings.

*Chanung Park, Joo Chan Lee, Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffO is a single-step diffusion model for image compression, offering high perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra-low bitrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from quality degradation at low bitrates and high latency due to multiple denoising steps.

Method: DiffO uses VQ Residual training for global and detailed latent space factorization and rate-adaptive noise modulation for bitrate matching.

Result: DiffO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving decoding speed by 50x.

Conclusion: DiffO enhances the practicality of generative codecs for ultra-low bitrate image compression.

Abstract: Although image compression is fundamental to visual data processing and has
inspired numerous standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer
severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent
diffusion based models provided enhanced generative performance at low
bitrates, they still yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding
latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the first
single step diffusion model for image compression (DiffO) that delivers high
perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra low bitrates. DiffO achieves
these goals by coupling two key innovations: (i) VQ Residual training, which
factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space,
capturing both global geometry and high frequency details; and (ii) rate
adaptive noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength on the fly to match
the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that DiffO surpasses state of
the art compression performance while improving decoding speed by about 50x
compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly improving the practicality
of generative codecs. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tumor segmentation in breast ultrasound is challenging due to noise, scale variations, and fuzzy boundaries, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The network combines DenseNet121 for feature extraction with an attention-enhanced decoder, using GSA, PE, SDPA, and SFEB for spatial and positional feature refinement. A hybrid loss function (BCE + Jaccard) optimizes accuracy.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on public datasets, showing promise for early breast cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: The proposed network effectively addresses segmentation challenges, offering potential to aid radiologists in accurate diagnosis.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for early breast cancer
detection, but automated tumor segmentation is challenging due to inherent
noise, variations in scale of lesions, and fuzzy boundaries. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel hybrid attention-based network for lesion
segmentation. Our proposed architecture integrates a pre-trained DenseNet121 in
the encoder part for robust feature extraction with a multi-branch
attention-enhanced decoder tailored for breast ultrasound images. The
bottleneck incorporates Global Spatial Attention (GSA), Position Encoding (PE),
and Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) to learn global context, spatial
relationships, and relative positional features. The Spatial Feature
Enhancement Block (SFEB) is embedded at skip connections to refine and enhance
spatial features, enabling the network to focus more effectively on tumor
regions. A hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and
Jaccard Index loss optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and region-level overlap
metrics, enhancing robustness to class imbalance and irregular tumor shapes.
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting its potential to assist radiologists in early and
accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Overfitting in deep learning for histopathology image analysis is addressed by showing that large-scale natural image models underperform and overfit. Domain-specific architectures outperform them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the limitations of using natural image models for histopathology tasks and the need for specialized solutions.

Method: Experiments with ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT) on histopathology datasets, comparing performance and overfitting.

Result: Increasing model capacity doesn't improve performance; simpler, domain-specific architectures perform better and reduce overfitting.

Conclusion: Customized architectures for histopathology are essential, especially with limited datasets, to avoid overfitting and improve results.

Abstract: This study investigates the critical problem of overfitting in deep learning
models applied to histopathology image analysis. We show that simply adopting
and fine-tuning large-scale models designed for natural image analysis often
leads to suboptimal performance and significant overfitting when applied to
histopathology tasks. Through extensive experiments with various model
architectures, including ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT), we show
that increasing model capacity does not necessarily improve performance on
histopathology datasets. Our findings emphasize the need for customized
architectures specifically designed for histopathology image analysis,
particularly when working with limited datasets. Using Oesophageal
Adenocarcinomas public dataset, we demonstrate that simpler, domain-specific
architectures can achieve comparable or better performance while minimizing
overfitting.

Motivation: The limitations of 18F-FDG for certain tumors and the challenges in synthesizing and using 18F-DOPA motivate the need for an alternative method to generate 18F-DOPA PET images.

Method: The study introduces PJDM, combining a coarse estimation model and a prior refinement model, using a higher-order hybrid sampler and learned prior for iterative refinement.

Result: PJDM effectively enhances sinogram quality and synthetic 18F-DOPA PET images.

Conclusion: The proposed PJDM offers a promising solution for generating 18F-DOPA PET images, addressing limitations of current tracers and methods.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic
activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers.
18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but
shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast,
6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity
for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, its complex
synthesis and limitations in transportation and clinical use hinder widespread
adoption. During PET imaging, the sinogram represents a form of raw data
acquired by the scanner. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more
direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the
accumulation of errors introduced during the image reconstruction process.
Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion
model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET images into 18F-DOPA PET images in
projection domain. Specifically, a coarse estimation model and a prior
refinement model are trained independently. During inference, an initial
synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is generated using a higher-order hybrid
sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition
to guide the iterative refinement process using learned prior. Experimental
results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and
synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.

*Ning Chu, Siya Zheng, Shanqing Zhang, Li Li, Caifang Cai, Ali Mohammad-Djafari, Feng Zhao, Yuanbo Song*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A neural framework combines temperature correction and image enhancement for infrared thermography, addressing emissivity variations and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation, leading to temperature inaccuracies.

Method: Uses a symmetric skip-CNN and emissivity-aware attention module, with ROI segmentation, dual-constrained loss, and dynamic feature fusion.

Result: Achieves accurate calibration and detail recovery in industrial conditions, validated on a blower system.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unifies temperature correction and image enhancement, improving infrared thermography accuracy.

Abstract: Infrared thermography faces persistent challenges in temperature accuracy due
to material emissivity variations, where existing methods often neglect the
joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation. This study
introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature
correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and
an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the
ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel
dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between
the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram
matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically
fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses
emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the
industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network
realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial
background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

### [724] [PET Tracer Separation Using Conditional Diffusion Transformer with Multi-latent Space Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16934)
*Bin Huang, Feihong Xu, Xinchong Shi, Shan Huang, Binxuan Li, Fei Li, Qiegen Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel model (MS-CDT) for PET tracer separation using texture conditions and multi-latent space, outperforming existing methods in image quality and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-tracer PET imaging provides comprehensive physiological insights but faces challenges in distinguishing tracer signals due to identical gamma-photon energies.

Method: Proposes MS-CDT, integrating diffusion and transformer architectures with texture masks and multi-latent space for enhanced tracer separation.

Result: MS-CDT achieves competitive performance in image quality and clinical relevance on brain and chest PET datasets.

Conclusion: MS-CDT is effective for PET tracer separation, balancing computational efficiency and detail preservation.

Abstract: In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET)
is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide
supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological
function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of
physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by
positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the
same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this
study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer
model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent
space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates
diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework,
with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image
details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers,
the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance
computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as
conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns,
thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image
textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this
conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer
separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with
several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest
scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive
performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant
information. Code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/MS-CDT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks in medical imaging are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, undermining diagnostic reliability and trust.

Method: Introduces RTDA, benchmarking it against six baseline techniques (including adversarial training and data augmentation) across three imaging technologies.

Result: RTDA shows superior robustness against adversarial attacks and better generalization with distribution shifts while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Conclusion: RTDA effectively enhances the reliability of medical image classifiers by addressing adversarial and distribution shift vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose
medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can
affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare
professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data
augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image
classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial
perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline
techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in
isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different
imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that
RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved
generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image
classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MeDi, a Metadata-guided generative Diffusion model, addresses biases in deep learning for histopathology by augmenting underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, improving downstream model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in histopathology lack robustness to varying conditions (e.g., staining, demographics), leading to biased predictions due to shortcut learning. Foundation models haven't fully resolved this.

Method: Proposes MeDi, a framework that models metadata to generate synthetic data for underrepresented subpopulations, balancing training data and mitigating biases.

Result: MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for unseen subpopulations, improves image fidelity, and enhances downstream classifier performance on datasets with subpopulation shifts.

Conclusion: MeDi demonstrates potential for mitigating data biases in histopathology using generative models, serving as a proof-of-concept.

Abstract: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological
prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice,
their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner,
hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on
overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent
patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale
foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided
generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted
augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which
balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We
experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for
unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated
images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on
datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards
better mitigating data biases with generative models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GAN-generated MRI images can augment limited medical datasets, but excessive synthetic data may reduce CNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of varying ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images on CNN classification performance.

Method: Used DCGAN to create synthetic images, mixed them with real images at different ratios, and trained a custom CNN for classification.

Result: High performance (95.2% accuracy) with small GAN additions, but performance declined as synthetic data proportion increased.

Conclusion: GANs are useful for data augmentation, but excessive synthetic data can harm model generalization.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding
limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of
GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN
in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic
images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.
The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results
indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor
classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a
small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN
images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching
95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the
proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.
This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets
especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce
artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

*Runmin Jiang, Zhaoxin Fan, Junhao Wu, Lenghan Zhu, Xin Huang, Tianyang Wang, Heng Huang, Min Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel weakly supervised learning pipeline for 3D medical image segmentation reduces reliance on fully annotated data, achieving competitive performance with fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised 3D medical image segmentation requires labor-intensive annotations. The paper aims to address this by proposing a weakly supervised approach.

Method: The pipeline includes Probability-based Pseudo Label Generation, a Probabilistic Multi-head Self-Attention network, and a Probability-informed Segmentation Loss Function.

Result: The method outperforms existing weakly supervised methods, achieving up to 18.1% improvement in Dice scores for certain organs.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is effective for 3D medical image segmentation, reducing annotation burden while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation is a challenging task with crucial implications
for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent advances in deep learning
have significantly enhanced fully supervised medical image segmentation.
However, this approach heavily relies on labor-intensive and time-consuming
fully annotated ground-truth labels, particularly for 3D volumes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a novel probabilistic-aware weakly supervised
learning pipeline, specifically designed for 3D medical imaging. Our pipeline
integrates three innovative components: a Probability-based Pseudo Label
Generation technique for synthesizing dense segmentation masks from sparse
annotations, a Probabilistic Multi-head Self-Attention network for robust
feature extraction within our Probabilistic Transformer Network, and a
Probability-informed Segmentation Loss Function to enhance training with
annotation confidence. Demonstrating significant advances, our approach not
only rivals the performance of fully supervised methods but also surpasses
existing weakly supervised methods in CT and MRI datasets, achieving up to
18.1% improvement in Dice scores for certain organs. The code is available at

*Manasi Muglikar, Siddharth Somasundaram, Akshat Dave, Edoardo Charbon, Ramesh Raskar, Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sensor fusion framework combining SPADs and event cameras to achieve high-speed, low-light imaging with reduced bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the trade-off in traditional cameras between low-light performance and high-speed imaging, which leads to motion blur or noisy images.

Method: Proposes a fusion framework integrating SPADs (for single-photon sensitivity and microsecond resolution) and event cameras (for high-speed brightness changes with low bandwidth).

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements (>5 dB PSNR) in reconstructing low-light scenes at high temporal resolution (100 kHz) compared to conventional cameras.

Conclusion: Event-SPAD fusion shows promise for applications like robotics and medical imaging, offering better performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Traditional cameras face a trade-off between low-light performance and
high-speed imaging: longer exposure times to capture sufficient light results
in motion blur, whereas shorter exposures result in Poisson-corrupted noisy
images. While burst photography techniques help mitigate this tradeoff,
conventional cameras are fundamentally limited in their sensor noise
characteristics. Event cameras and single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors
have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional cameras due to their
desirable properties. SPADs are capable of single-photon sensitivity with
microsecond temporal resolution, and event cameras can measure brightness
changes up to 1 MHz with low bandwidth requirements. We show that these
properties are complementary, and can help achieve low-light, high-speed image
reconstruction with low bandwidth requirements. We introduce a sensor fusion
framework to combine SPADs with event cameras to improves the reconstruction of
high-speed, low-light scenes while reducing the high bandwidth cost associated
with using every SPAD frame. Our evaluation, on both synthetic and real sensor
data, demonstrates significant enhancements ( > 5 dB PSNR) in reconstructing
low-light scenes at high temporal resolution (100 kHz) compared to conventional
cameras. Event-SPAD fusion shows great promise for real-world applications,
such as robotics or medical imaging.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on CXR-LT 24 dataset, excels in label efficiency, and generalizes well to out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: CheXFound demonstrates strong generalization and efficiency, enabling diverse clinical applications with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most frequently ordered imaging test, supporting
diverse clinical tasks from thoracic disease detection to postoperative

require costly labeled data, and lack generalizability to out-of-distribution
datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXFound, a

pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million
unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local
Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by
incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for
enhanced performance in multilabel classification. Our experimental results
show that CheXFound outperforms state-of-the-art models in classifying 40

and exhibits superior label efficiency on downstream tasks with limited
training data. Additionally, CheXFound achieved significant improvements on new
tasks with out-of-distribution datasets, including opportunistic cardiovascular

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A patch-based neural network approach learns adaptive regularization for image denoising with weighted TV, outperforming scalar regularization for unknown noise distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address image denoising when noise distribution (Gaussian or Poisson) is unknown, requiring adaptive regularization.

Method: Uses a binary classification network for noise model selection, then learns patch-based optimal TV weights supervisedly via SSIM optimization.

Result: Significant improvement over scalar regularization for both Gaussian and Poisson noise models.

Conclusion: The adaptive patch-based approach effectively handles unknown noise distributions, enhancing denoising performance.

Abstract: We consider a patch-based learning approach defined in terms of neural
networks to estimate spatially adaptive regularisation parameter maps for image
denoising with weighted Total Variation (TV) and test it to situations when the
noise distribution is unknown. As an example, we consider situations where
noise could be either Gaussian or Poisson and perform preliminary model
selection by a standard binary classification network. Then, we define a
patch-based approach where at each image pixel an optimal weighting between TV
regularisation and the corresponding data fidelity is learned in a supervised
way using reference natural image patches upon optimisation of SSIM and in a
sliding window fashion. Extensive numerical results are reported for both noise
models, showing significant improvement w.r.t. results obtained by means of
optimal scalar regularisation.

*Jonghun Kim, Gyeongdeok Jo, Sinyoung Ra, Hyunjin Park*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed an HE inference framework for medical images using VQGAN for compression and polynomial approximations for activation functions, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data require privacy protection, but HE inference is computationally expensive for large images.

Method: Uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, approximates activation functions with low-degree polynomials, and adapts squeeze and excitation modules.

Result: Achieved optimal balance with an 8x downsampling factor; minor performance differences compared to unencrypted inference.

Conclusion: The framework shows strong potential for practical use in medical imaging despite slower HE inference.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images
