### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan, Xiangdong Su, Xu Liu, Ruirui Wang, Ke Chang, Jiang Li, Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces McBE, a multi-task Chinese bias evaluation benchmark, addressing the lack of culturally relevant bias datasets for LLMs. It evaluates biases in popular LLMs, revealing varying degrees of bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluation datasets are limited to English and North American culture, lacking relevance for Chinese language and culture. They also lack multi-task evaluation capabilities.

Method: Developed McBE, a benchmark with 4,077 instances, 12 bias categories, 82 subcategories, and 5 evaluation tasks, to comprehensively assess LLM biases.

Result: Popular LLMs exhibited varying degrees of bias, analyzed in-depth to provide new insights.

Conclusion: McBE fills a gap in bias evaluation for Chinese language and culture, offering a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM biases.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin, Yapeng Wang, Leonel Santos, Tao Fang, Xu Yang, Sio Kei Im, Hugo Gon√ßalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs for dialogue summarization, finding stepwise reasoning often harms performance by causing verbosity and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of reasoning LLMs (like Long Chain-of-Thought) in dialogue summarization, a task with practical applications in customer service and conversational AI.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation across three paradigms (generic, role-oriented, query-oriented) using benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, QMSum) and advanced metrics (LLM-based and human-inspired).

Result: Reasoning LLMs underperform, producing verbose, inconsistent, and less concise summaries compared to non-reasoning LLMs.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have limitations for dialogue summarization, requiring targeted improvements in modeling and evaluation.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu, Yuechuan Yang, Kyle Lee, Yanshu Li, Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether latent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning emerges in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, finding limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT and noting inconsistencies in probing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if recurrent architectures like Huginn-3.5B can internalize reasoning (latent CoT) without externalizing steps, improving efficiency over standard CoT methods.

Method: Probing techniques (Logit Lens, Coda Lens) are used to analyze Huginn-3.5B's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks, tracking rank trajectories of tokens.

Result: Limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT; probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks; marginal gains from increased recurrence depth.

Conclusion: Latent CoT in Huginn-3.5B is less effective than explicit CoT, with interpretability and performance limitations.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02221)
*Steven Song, Anirudh Subramanyam, Zhenyu Zhang, Aarti Venkat, Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot is an open-source tool that uses LLMs to generate GDC cohort filters from natural language descriptions, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to navigate the GDC's complex cohort creation interface, and natural language descriptions could simplify the process.

Method: Developed and evaluated multiple LLMs, including a locally-served open-source model, to generate cohort filters from natural language.

Result: The locally-served GDC Cohort LLM outperformed GPT-4o in generating accurate cohort filters.

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot effectively bridges the gap between natural language descriptions and complex cohort creation in the GDC.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

### [5] [MemAgent: Reshaping Long-Context LLM with Multi-Conv RL-based Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02259)
*Hongli Yu, Tinghong Chen, Jiangtao Feng, Jiangjie Chen, Weinan Dai, Qiying Yu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Wei-Ying Ma, Jingjing Liu, Mingxuan Wang, Hao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemAgent optimizes long-text tasks with a segment-based memory update strategy, achieving strong performance on large-scale tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling infinitely long documents efficiently without performance degradation is a key challenge in long-text processing.

Method: Introduces MemAgent, which reads text in segments and updates memory with an overwrite strategy, extending the DAPO algorithm for training.

Result: Achieves <5% performance loss on a 3.5M QA task and 95%+ on a 512K RULER test, extrapolating from 8K to 32K context.

Conclusion: MemAgent demonstrates robust long-context capabilities, addressing the challenge of long-text processing effectively.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

### [6] [DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02302)
*Dohoon Kim, Donghun Kang, Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DoMIX introduces a novel approach for continual Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) using LoRA modules, addressing computational costs, domain order sensitivity, and task-specific model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual DAP methods are computationally expensive, sensitive to data order, and lack task-specific adaptability.

Method: Leverages LoRA modules for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling efficient, parallel, and order-robust domain-adaptive pre-training.

Result: DoMIX provides tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks and extends to standard LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DoMIX effectively addresses key challenges in continual DAP, offering a scalable and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT replaces classical FFN modules in BERT with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), achieving higher accuracy and parameter efficiency while excelling in few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominant parameter contribution of FFNs in Transformers and the potential of PQCs to enhance expressibility and efficiency.

Method: Hybrid quantum-classical transformer with PQC-based FFN layers, featuring residual connections, RY/RZ rotations, and alternating entanglement for stable training.

Result: QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102% baseline accuracy, reduces FFN parameters by 99%, and shows superior data efficiency in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: PQCs, when co-designed with deep learning principles, are powerful and parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

*Weijie Lyu, Sheng-Jun Huang, Xuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using a parametric model for code data selection improves training efficiency and model performance, achieving gains with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on data quantity over quality, reducing training efficiency.

Method: Utilizes a parametric model for code data selection to ensure distribution consistency and diversity.

Result: Achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) with only 10K samples, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively boosts performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

### [10] [Benchmarking Akan ASR Models Across Domain-Specific Datasets: A Comparative Evaluation of Performance, Scalability, and Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02407)
*Mark Atta Mensah, Isaac Wiafe, Akon Ekpezu, Justice Kwame Appati, Jamal-Deen Abdulai, Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten, Frank Ernest Yeboah, Gifty Odame*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks seven Akan ASR models (Whisper and Wav2Vec2) across diverse speech domains, revealing domain dependency and distinct error behaviors between architectures, emphasizing the need for domain adaptation in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating ASR model generalization across diverse speech contexts, particularly for low-resource languages like Akan.

Method: Benchmarked seven transformer-based Akan ASR models using four diverse speech corpora, analyzing word and character error rates.

Result: Models showed domain dependency, with performance drops in mismatched scenarios. Whisper produced fluent but misleading errors, while Wav2Vec2 yielded obvious but less interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: Targeted domain adaptation, adaptive routing, and multilingual training are crucial for improving ASR in low-resource languages like Akan.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Method: Developed a cookbook of best practices, curated an open-source dataset of impaired speech in Akan, and fine-tuned open-source ASR models.

Result: Created the first open-source impaired speech dataset in Akan, along with tools and a cookbook for broader application.

Conclusion: The approach successfully supports inclusive ASR technology development for speech-impaired individuals in low-resource languages.

Abstract: This study presents an approach for collecting speech samples to build
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for impaired speech, particularly,
low-resource languages. It aims to democratize ASR technology and data
collection by developing a "cookbook" of best practices and training for
community-driven data collection and ASR model building. As a proof-of-concept,
this study curated the first open-source dataset of impaired speech in Akan: a
widely spoken indigenous language in Ghana. The study involved participants
from diverse backgrounds with speech impairments. The resulting dataset, along
with the cookbook and open-source tools, are publicly available to enable
researchers and practitioners to create inclusive ASR technologies tailored to
the unique needs of speech impaired individuals. In addition, this study
presents the initial results of fine-tuning open-source ASR models to better
recognize impaired speech in Akan.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebSailor, a post-training method, enhances LLMs' ability to handle high-uncertainty tasks, matching proprietary models like DeepResearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in open-source LLMs' ability to systematically reduce uncertainty in complex information-seeking tasks.

Method: Uses structured sampling, information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and DUPO (agentic RL training).

Result: WebSailor outperforms open-source agents and matches proprietary models in performance.

Conclusion: WebSailor bridges the capability gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs in complex tasks.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### [14] [Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02593)
*Cornelia Gruber, Helen Alber, Bernd Bischl, G√∂ran Kauermann, Barbara Plank, Matthias A√üenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of label variation (LV) in supervised learning, emphasizing human label variation (HLV) as an informative signal. It critiques assumptions in active learning (AL) and proposes a framework to integrate HLV into AL, including LLMs as annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve supervised learning by acknowledging and utilizing HLV, which is often overlooked in favor of a single ground truth assumption.

Method: The paper surveys existing approaches to LV and AL, critiques their assumptions, and proposes a conceptual framework for HLV-aware AL, including instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation.

Result: The result is a conceptual foundation for incorporating HLV into AL, addressing real-world annotation complexities.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the need to decompose LV into signal (HLV) and noise, and the potential of integrating LLMs to enhance annotation processes.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Koji Inoue, Mikey Elmers, Yahui Fu, Zi Haur Pang, Divesh Lala, Keiko Ochi, Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel transformer-based model for turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems, dynamically controlled via textual prompts like 'faster' or 'calmer,' improves accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems by enabling dynamic, intuitive control through textual prompts.

Method: Extends a transformer-based VAP model by integrating textual prompt embeddings into channel-wise and cross-channel transformers, using synthetic prompts generated by an LLM.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy and adaptable turn-taking timing behaviors based on textual prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively combines textual prompts with transformer architectures for dynamic turn-taking control.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

TL;DR: MPF is a posttraining alignment framework for LLMs that mitigates bias by leveraging multiperspective generations and interpretable baselines, achieving small KL divergence and reduced calibration error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for easy bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) without extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Method: Uses the SAGED pipeline to construct bias benchmarks and extract interpretable baselines. Decomposes baselines into perspective components, guiding generation through weighted sampling and balancing.

Result: Aligns LLM sentiment distributions with counterfactual and HR baselines, showing small KL divergence, reduced calibration error, and generalization to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF provides a scalable, interpretable, and compatible method for bias mitigation in deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenderLexicon, a dataset and framework to measure contextual and gender biases, confirming biases beyond occupational stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the correlation between gender and contextual biases, particularly in action verbs, object nouns, and occupations.

Method: Introduces GenderLexicon dataset and a framework to estimate and score contextual and gender biases, evaluated on five diverse datasets.

Result: Confirms existence of gender biases beyond occupational stereotypes and improves bias explainability.

Conclusion: The approach is validated and effective, demonstrating broader gender biases in language.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

*Zhijian Xu, Yilun Zhao, Manasi Patwardhan, Lovekesh Vig, Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LimitGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to assist in peer review by identifying limitations in AI research, using synthetic and human-written datasets enhanced with literature retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of scientific publications makes peer review challenging, and LLMs' potential to assist in identifying paper limitations is understudied.

Method: Developed LimitGen, a benchmark with synthetic (LimitGen-Syn) and human-written (LimitGen-Human) datasets, augmented with literature retrieval to improve LLMs' limitation identification.

Result: Enhanced LLM systems can generate more concrete and constructive feedback on research paper limitations.

Conclusion: LimitGen advances LLMs' role in peer review by improving their ability to identify and articulate research limitations.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

### [19] [Measurement of the Granularity of Vowel Production Space By Just Producible Different (JPD) Limens](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02744)
*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study measures the 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD) in vowel mimicry, finding it ranges between 14-51 mels in F1 X F2 space, impacting theories of speech production and vowel system structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the accuracy of sub-phonemic control in vowel production and its implications for speech theories and vowel system structures.

Method: Uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to measure JPD among English speakers during front vowel production.

Result: JPD is estimated between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space.

Conclusion: The findings influence episodic speech production theories and set a lower bound for vowel phoneme proximity in formant space.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [20] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit a 'Self-Correction Blind Spot,' failing to correct their own errors despite identifying them in user input. A new benchmark reveals a 64.5% blind spot rate, linked to training data composition. Adding 'Wait' reduces blind spots by 89.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study why LLMs fail to self-correct errors in their own outputs despite recognizing them in user input, and to improve their reliability.

Method: Introduces Self-Correction Bench, a framework with controlled error injection at three complexity levels, testing 14 models.

Result: Average 64.5% blind spot rate; training data composition (lack of error-correction examples) is a key factor. Adding 'Wait' reduces blind spots by 89.3%.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical LLM limitation and suggests training adjustments (e.g., including error-correction sequences) to enhance reliability.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

### [21] [Is Reasoning All You Need? Probing Bias in the Age of Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02799)
*Riccardo Cantini, Nicola Gabriele, Alessio Orsino, Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMs with reasoning capabilities (CoT or fine-tuned) are more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning capabilities in RLMs affect their robustness to social biases and whether reasoning mechanisms inadvertently reinforce stereotypes.

Method: Used the CLEAR-Bias benchmark to evaluate RLMs across sociocultural dimensions, employing LLM-as-a-judge for safety scoring and jailbreak techniques to test safety mechanisms.

Result: Reasoning-enabled models are more prone to bias elicitation, with CoT prompting being especially vulnerable to contextual reframing attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning does not inherently improve bias robustness; bias-aware reasoning design is needed.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

### [22] [Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with Diverse Solving Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02804)
*Wenhao Shi, Zhiqiang Hu, Yi Bin, Yang Yang, See-Kiong Ng, Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathV-DP dataset and Qwen-VL-DP model enhance multimodal math reasoning by capturing diverse solution trajectories and using RL for improved accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for math reasoning lack diversity in reasoning perspectives and internal reflections, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Introduce MathV-DP dataset with multiple solution trajectories. Develop Qwen-VL-DP model using supervised learning and GRPO, an RL approach with correctness and diversity rewards.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP outperforms prior MLLMs in accuracy and generative diversity on MathVista and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse reasoning perspectives and reflective reasoning improves multimodal mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

### [23] [SynapseRoute: An Auto-Route Switching Framework on Dual-State Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02822)
*Wencheng Zhang, Shiqin Qiao, Lingjie Luo, Yinfeng Li, Chuanyang Zheng, Qian Xu, Meng Li, Yong Gui, Yijun He, Jianing Qiu, Jindong Hong, Jiankai Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynapseRoute, a dynamic routing framework for LLMs, showing that 58% of medical queries don't need high-cost reasoning. It improves accuracy, reduces time and token usage, and avoids over-reasoning pitfalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance performance and cost in LLMs by leveraging the dichotomy between high-reasoning and low-cost modes for medical queries.

Method: Proposes SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based framework that dynamically routes queries to either thinking or non-thinking modes based on complexity.

Result: SynapseRoute improves accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduces inference time by 36.8%, and token consumption by 39.66%. Avoids over-reasoning pitfalls.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing optimizes accuracy, cost, and efficiency. The AIT index helps evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and token cost.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

### [24] [Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02833)
*Valentina Pyatkin, Saumya Malik, Victoria Graf, Hamish Ivison, Shengyi Huang, Pradeep Dasigi, Nathan Lambert, Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI models' ability to generalize precise instruction following, and proposes RLVR (reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with generalizing precise instruction following, especially for unseen constraints, despite overfitting on benchmark tasks.

Method: The authors design IFBench with 58 diverse constraints and use RLVR, incorporating constraint verification modules, to train models.

Result: RLVR significantly improves models' ability to follow precise instructions, as demonstrated on IFBench.

Conclusion: The work provides tools (IFBench, training constraints, RLVR prompts, and code) to advance research in precise instruction following.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

### [25] [LLM Hypnosis: Exploiting User Feedback for Unauthorized Knowledge Injection to All Users](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02850)
*Almog Hilel, Idan Shenfeld, Leshem Choshen, Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user feedback allows a single user to persistently alter LM behavior by manipulating prompts and feedback, leading to poisoned outputs even in benign contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how user feedback in preference tuning can be exploited to manipulate LM knowledge and behavior, revealing a new attack vector.

Method: Attackers prompt LMs to output poisoned or benign responses, then upvote poisoned or downvote benign ones. Feedback signals are later used in preference tuning, increasing poisoned outputs.

Result: The attack successfully inserts false facts, modifies code generation to introduce security flaws, and injects fake financial news.

Conclusion: This identifies a new feature of preference tuning and a novel attack mechanism for LMs, extending prior work on data poisoning and prompt injection.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

### [26] [MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02851)
*Purbesh Mitra, Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOTIF is a reinforcement learning method for LLMs to generate thinking tokens in multiple rounds, overcoming context size limits, improving reasoning accuracy with sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Context size limits in LLMs hinder reasoning with large token numbers; modular thinking strategies are needed to bypass this bottleneck.

Method: Proposes MOTIF, an RL training method for multi-round thinking token generation, tested on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct using GSM8K dataset.

Result: Achieved 3.8% and 3.3% accuracy improvements on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks, with 15% sample efficiency.

Conclusion: MOTIF effectively enhances LLM reasoning beyond context limits, demonstrating practical improvements and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

### [27] [Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02856)
*Nikhil Chandak, Shashwat Goel, Ameya Prabhu, Moritz Hardt, Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques multiple-choice benchmarks for language model evaluation, proposing generative evaluation via answer matching, which aligns better with human grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple-choice benchmarks are flawed as models can answer without understanding the question, highlighting the need for a more reliable evaluation method.

Method: Introduces answer matching: models generate free-form responses, which are compared to reference answers using modern language models. Human grading data from MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond is used to validate the approach.

Result: Answer matching achieves near-perfect agreement with human grading, outperforming multiple-choice and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Model rankings change significantly under this new evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper advocates shifting from multiple-choice to answer matching for more accurate and scalable language model evaluation.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

*Brando Miranda, Alycia Lee, Sudharsan Sundar, Allison Casasola, Rylan Schaeffer, Elyas Obbad, Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper formalizes data quality in LLMs by introducing a 'diversity coefficient' to measure variability in pre-training data, showing its impact on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously characterize the nebulous concept of data quality in LLM pre-training, focusing on variability.

Method: Proposes a diversity coefficient, analyzes its properties, measures it in public datasets, and tests its impact via controlled experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2.

Result: The diversity coefficient aligns with intuitive diversity properties and causally improves downstream model performance.

Conclusion: Formal diversity is a key aspect of data quality, capturing variability and enhancing evaluation performance.

Abstract: Current trends in pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus
on the scaling of model and dataset size. While the quality of pre-training
data is considered an important factor for training powerful LLMs, it remains a
nebulous concept that has not been rigorously characterized. To this end, we
propose a formalization of one key aspect of data quality -- measuring the
variability of natural language data -- specifically via a measure we call the
diversity coefficient. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed diversity
coefficient aligns with the intuitive properties of diversity and variability,
e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. Then, we measure
the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets and
demonstrate that their formal diversity is high compared to theoretical lower
and upper bounds. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive set of controlled
interventional experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2 that demonstrate the
diversity coefficient of pre-training data characterizes useful aspects of
downstream model evaluation performance -- totaling 44 models of various sizes
(51M to 7B parameters). We conclude that our formal notion of diversity is an
important aspect of data quality that captures variability and causally leads
to improved evaluation performance.

### [29] [Improving the Robustness of Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition via Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Learning and Student-Student Collaborative Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08010)
*Shuzheng Si, Helan Hu, Haozhe Zhao, Shuang Zeng, Kaikai An, Zefan Cai, Baobao Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods to improve Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER) by addressing label noise and error propagation in teacher-student frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DS-NER reduces annotation burden but suffers from label noise. Existing teacher-student methods perform poorly due to incorrect pseudo labels from the teacher network.

Method: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Learning to reduce incorrect pseudo labels using prediction uncertainty. (2) Student-Student Collaborative Learning to transfer reliable labels between students and explore mislabeled samples.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art DS-NER methods on five datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates label noise and improves robustness in DS-NER.

Abstract: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER) is widely used in
real-world scenarios. It can effectively alleviate the burden of annotation by
matching entities in existing knowledge bases with snippets in the text but
suffer from the label noise. Recent works attempt to adopt the teacher-student
framework to gradually refine the training labels and improve the overall
robustness. However, these teacher-student methods achieve limited performance
because the poor calibration of the teacher network produces incorrectly
pseudo-labeled samples, leading to error propagation. Therefore, we propose:
(1) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Learning that leverages the prediction
uncertainty to reduce the number of incorrect pseudo labels in the
self-training stage; (2) Student-Student Collaborative Learning that allows the
transfer of reliable labels between two student networks instead of
indiscriminately relying on all pseudo labels from its teacher, and further
enables a full exploration of mislabeled samples rather than simply filtering
unreliable pseudo-labeled samples. We evaluate our proposed method on five
DS-NER datasets, demonstrating that our method is superior to the
state-of-the-art DS-NER methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores NLP techniques for multilingual tourism-related tweets, introducing a novel dataset and demonstrating competitive results with minimal annotated data using few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient NLP strategies in tourism due to social media's influence, addressing challenges like multilingual, unstructured data and the demand for manual annotations.

Method: Built a multilingual dataset (French, English, Spanish) with annotations for NER, thematic concepts, and sentiment analysis. Compared few-shot and fine-tuning techniques with modern language models.

Result: Few-shot techniques achieved competitive results with minimal data: 5 tweets per label for sentiment analysis, 30 for NER, and 1K for thematic concepts (315 classes).

Conclusion: The study reduces reliance on manual annotations and rule-based solutions, enabling NLP applications in new domains with limited data.

Abstract: The rising influence of social media platforms in various domains, including
tourism, has highlighted the growing need for efficient and automated Natural
Language Processing (NLP) strategies to take advantage of this valuable
resource. However, the transformation of multilingual, unstructured, and
informal texts into structured knowledge still poses significant challenges,
most notably the never-ending requirement for manually annotated data to train
deep learning classifiers. In this work, we study different NLP techniques to
establish the best ones to obtain competitive performances while keeping the
need for training annotated data to a minimum. To do so, we built the first
publicly available multilingual dataset (French, English, and Spanish) for the
tourism domain, composed of tourism-related tweets. The dataset includes
multilayered, manually revised annotations for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
for Locations and Fine-grained Thematic Concepts Extraction mapped to the
Thesaurus of Tourism and Leisure Activities of the World Tourism Organization,
as well as for Sentiment Analysis at the tweet level. Extensive experimentation
comparing various few-shot and fine-tuning techniques with modern language
models demonstrate that modern few-shot techniques allow us to obtain
competitive results for all three tasks with very little annotation data: 5
tweets per label (15 in total) for Sentiment Analysis, 30 tweets for Named
Entity Recognition of Locations and 1K tweets annotated with fine-grained
thematic concepts, a highly fine-grained sequence labeling task based on an
inventory of 315 classes. We believe that our results, grounded in a novel
dataset, pave the way for applying NLP to new domain-specific applications,
reducing the need for manual annotations and circumventing the complexities of
rule-based, ad-hoc solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the extent of LLM usage in biomedical academic writing, given their potential for inaccuracies and biases, and to assess their impact compared to other major influences like the Covid pandemic.

Method: Analyzed vocabulary changes in over 15 million PubMed-indexed biomedical abstracts (2010-2024) to detect LLM influence through style word frequency shifts.

Result: At least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were likely processed by LLMs, varying by discipline, country, and journal (up to 40%). LLMs' impact surpassed even the Covid pandemic's effect on scientific writing.

Conclusion: LLMs have significantly influenced biomedical research writing, with widespread adoption and a measurable impact on abstract style, exceeding other major events.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with
human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can
produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily
misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how
wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this
question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased,
large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in over 15 million biomedical
abstracts from 2010--2024 indexed by PubMed, and show how the appearance of
LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This
excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were
processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries,
and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an
unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing
the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.

### [32] [Task Prompt Vectors: Effective Initialization through Multi-Task Soft-Prompt Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01119)
*Robert Belanec, Simon Ostermann, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task Prompt Vectors, a method for efficient multi-task prompt tuning in LLMs by using element-wise differences between tuned and random soft-prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soft-prompt methods lack modularity for multi-task learning, requiring repeated training for new tasks.

Method: Task Prompt Vectors are created by element-wise difference between tuned soft-prompts and their random initialization, enabling prompt arithmetic.

Result: Experiments on 12 NLU datasets show effectiveness in low-resource settings and independence from random initialization.

Conclusion: Task Prompt Vectors offer a competitive alternative to baselines through arithmetic operations, enhancing multi-task prompt tuning.

Abstract: Prompt tuning is an efficient solution for training large language models
(LLMs). However, current soft-prompt-based methods often sacrifice multi-task
modularity, requiring the training process to be fully or partially repeated
for each newly added task. While recent work on task vectors applied arithmetic
operations on full model weights to achieve the desired multi-task performance,
a similar approach for soft-prompts is still missing. To this end, we introduce
Task Prompt Vectors, created by element-wise difference between weights of
tuned soft-prompts and their random initialization. Experimental results on 12
NLU datasets show that task prompt vectors can be used in low-resource settings
to effectively initialize prompt tuning on similar tasks. In addition, we show
that task prompt vectors are independent of the random initialization of prompt
tuning on 2 different language model architectures. This allows prompt
arithmetics with the pre-trained vectors from different tasks. In this way, we
provide a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art baselines by arithmetic
addition of task prompt vectors from multiple tasks.

*Dingkang Yang, Jinjie Wei, Mingcheng Li, Jiyao Liu, Lihao Liu, Ming Hu, Junjun He, Yakun Ju, Wei Zhou, Yang Liu, Lihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedAide is an LLM-based medical multi-agent framework for intent-aware information fusion and coordinated reasoning, addressing redundancy and hallucinations in healthcare systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare systems struggle with information redundancy and coupling when handling complex medical intents, leading to unreliable decision-making.

Method: MedAide uses regularization-guided query decomposition, dynamic intent prototype matching, and rotation agent collaboration for adaptive intent recognition and fusion.

Result: MedAide outperforms current LLMs on medical benchmarks, improving proficiency and strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances medical decision-making by addressing LLM limitations in complex healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: In healthcare intelligence, the ability to fuse heterogeneous, multi-intent
information from diverse clinical sources is fundamental to building reliable
decision-making systems. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven information
interaction systems currently showing potential promise in the healthcare
domain. Nevertheless, they often suffer from information redundancy and
coupling when dealing with complex medical intents, leading to severe
hallucinations and performance bottlenecks. To this end, we propose MedAide, an
LLM-based medical multi-agent collaboration framework designed to enable
intent-aware information fusion and coordinated reasoning across specialized
healthcare domains. Specifically, we introduce a regularization-guided module
that combines syntactic constraints with retrieval augmented generation to
decompose complex queries into structured representations, facilitating
fine-grained clinical information fusion and intent resolution. Additionally, a
dynamic intent prototype matching module is proposed to utilize dynamic
prototype representation with a semantic similarity matching mechanism to
achieve adaptive recognition and updating of the agent's intent in multi-round
healthcare dialogues. Ultimately, we design a rotation agent collaboration
mechanism that introduces dynamic role rotation and decision-level information
fusion across specialized medical agents. Extensive experiments are conducted
on four medical benchmarks with composite intents. Experimental results from
automated metrics and expert doctor evaluations show that MedAide outperforms
current LLMs and improves their medical proficiency and strategic reasoning.

*Ruibo Chen, Yihan Wu, Junfeng Guo, Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: De-mark is a framework for removing n-gram-based watermarks from machine-generated content, using random selection probing to assess and exploit watermark strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of watermarking schemes in identifying machine-generated content and develop a method to remove such watermarks.

Method: Utilizes random selection probing to identify and exploit the red-green list in n-gram watermarks.

Result: Demonstrated efficiency in removing watermarks from models like Llama3 and ChatGPT.

Conclusion: De-mark effectively removes n-gram-based watermarks, highlighting vulnerabilities in current watermarking techniques.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques offer a promising way to identify machine-generated
content via embedding covert information into the contents generated from
language models (LMs). However, the robustness of the watermarking schemes has
not been well explored. In this paper, we present De-mark, an advanced
framework designed to remove n-gram-based watermarks effectively. Our method
utilizes a novel querying strategy, termed random selection probing, which aids
in assessing the strength of the watermark and identifying the red-green list
within the n-gram watermark. Experiments on popular LMs, such as Llama3 and
ChatGPT, demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of De-mark in watermark
removal and exploitation tasks.

*Chenyang An, Shima Imani, Feng Yao, Chengyu Dong, Ali Abbasi, Harsh Shrivastava, Samuel Buss, Jingbo Shang, Gayathri Mahalingam, Pramod Sharma, Maurice Diesendruck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs trained on logically ordered proofs underperform due to suboptimal data ordering. Intuitively sequential ordering improves proof generation, showing an 11% boost in success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform modestly on proof tasks due to suboptimal proof ordering in training data, which prioritizes verification over learning.

Method: Proposed intuitively sequential order for proofs, validated on intuitionistic propositional logic and digit multiplication tasks.

Result: Training on optimal order improves proof success rate by 11%. Found 17.3% of advanced math proofs have ordering issues.

Conclusion: Intuitively sequential ordering enhances LLM proof generation, highlighting the impact of data structure on model performance.

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM)-based proof generation, despite
extensive training on large datasets such as ArXiv, LLMs still exhibit only
modest performance on proving tasks of moderate difficulty. We believe that
this is partly due to the widespread presence of suboptimal ordering within the
data for each proof used in training. For example, published proofs often
follow a purely logical order, where each step logically proceeds from the
previous steps based on the deductive rules. This order is designed to
facilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help
people and models learn the discovery process of the proof. In proof
generation, we argue that the optimal order for one training data sample occurs
when the relevant intermediate supervision for a particular proof step in the
proof is always positioned to the left of that proof step. We call such order
the intuitively sequential order. We validate our claims using two tasks:
intuitionistic propositional logic theorem-proving and digit multiplication.
Our experiments verify the order effect and provide support for our
explanations. We demonstrate that training is most effective when the proof is
in the intuitively sequential order. Moreover, the order effect and the
performance gap between models trained on different data orders can be
substantial -- with an 11 percent improvement in proof success rate observed in
the propositional logic theorem-proving task, between models trained on the
optimal order compared to the worst order. Lastly, we define a common type of
order issue in advanced math proofs and find that 17.3 percent of theorems with
nontrivial proofs in the first two chapters of a widely used graduate-level
mathematics textbook suffer from this issue. A detailed list of those proofs is
provided in the appendix.

*Shester Gueuwou, Xiaodan Du, Greg Shakhnarovich, Karen Livescu, Alexander H. Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHuBERT is a self-supervised contextual representation model for sign language, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks by leveraging multi-stream visual input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sign language models are task-specific or ignore temporal relationships, limiting transfer learning and unlabeled data use.

Method: SHuBERT adapts masked token prediction to multi-stream visual input (hand, face, body pose) from 1,000 hours of ASL video.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in sign language translation, isolated recognition, and fingerspelling detection.

Conclusion: SHuBERT advances sign language processing by enabling contextual, self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Sign language processing has traditionally relied on task-specific models,
limiting the potential for transfer learning across tasks. Pre-training methods
for sign language have typically focused on either supervised pre-training,
which cannot take advantage of unlabeled data, or context-independent (frame or
video segment) representations, which ignore the effects of relationships
across time in sign language. We introduce SHuBERT (Sign Hidden-Unit BERT), a
self-supervised contextual representation model learned from approximately
1,000 hours of American Sign Language video. SHuBERT adapts masked token
prediction objectives to multi-stream visual sign language input, learning to
predict multiple targets corresponding to clustered hand, face, and body pose
streams. SHuBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks
including sign language translation, isolated sign language recognition, and
fingerspelling detection.

*Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compressing the KV cache during input processing allows larger batch sizes and higher throughput without losing model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in settings with limited GPU memory and long input contexts.

Method: Compress the KV cache during both input processing and token generation phases.

Result: Larger batch sizes and significantly higher throughput while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: KV cache compression during input processing enhances efficiency in memory-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs
from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on
compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster
token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input
context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing
the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used
resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the
original model's accuracy.

*Yuchen Fu, Zifeng Cheng, Zhiwei Jiang, Zhonghui Wang, Yafeng Yin, Zhengliang Li, Qing Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token Prepending (TP), a plug-and-play technique to improve sentence embeddings from LLMs by allowing earlier tokens to attend to complete sentence information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for extracting sentence embeddings from LLMs suffer from biased encoding due to causal attention mechanisms, limiting the quality of embeddings.

Method: Proposes Token Prepending (TP), which prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the next layer's input, enabling full sentence attention under causal constraints.

Result: TP significantly improves performance on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) and downstream tasks with minimal added inference cost.

Conclusion: TP is an effective, training-free solution for enhancing prompt-based sentence embeddings in autoregressive LLMs.

Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a
promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding
capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit
sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence
information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly
decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the
sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of
sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this
end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each
layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next
layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence
information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is
a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly
integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and
autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our
proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing
prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring
negligible additional inference cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
significantly improve the alignment of human-AI values and further raise the
upper bound of AI capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive,
long-context Chain-of-Thought (long-CoT) tasks. However, existing RLHF (or
RLVR) frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and
complexity barriers, restricting their accessibility for newcomers. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly, scalable, and
easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and
HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of data alignment over dataset size in training LLMs, using the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient to measure its impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional focus on dataset size and explore the overlooked aspect of data alignment in LLM training.

Method: Uses Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient to quantify alignment impact. Conducts interventional experiments in pre-training and fine-tuning settings, focusing on Autoformalization.

Result: Strong negative correlation between alignment coefficient and model loss/perplexity, indicating better performance with aligned data.

Conclusion: Data alignment is crucial for LLM performance, especially in specialized tasks like Autoformalization, suggesting a shift in training priorities.

Abstract: Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, we explore the role of
data alignment -- an often overlooked aspect of data quality -- in training
capable Large Language Models (LLMs). To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based
alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two
datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and
evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled
\textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of
increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against
evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients
between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation.
The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine
translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In
both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the
alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's
loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a
re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data
alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks
such as Autoformalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to authenticate AI-generated content due to AI surpassing human text generation capabilities.

Method: MCmark partitions the model's vocabulary into segments and adjusts token probabilities based on a watermark key.

Result: MCmark improves detectability by over 10% compared to existing unbiased watermarks without distorting text quality.

Conclusion: MCmark enhances the practicality of watermarking in AI-generated texts, offering better detectability and robustness.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence surpasses human capabilities in text generation,
the necessity to authenticate the origins of AI-generated content has become
paramount. Unbiased watermarks offer a powerful solution by embedding
statistical signals into language model-generated text without distorting the
quality. In this paper, we introduce MCmark, a family of unbiased,
Multi-Channel-based watermarks. MCmark works by partitioning the model's
vocabulary into segments and promoting token probabilities within a selected
segment based on a watermark key. We demonstrate that MCmark not only preserves
the original distribution of the language model but also offers significant
improvements in detectability and robustness over existing unbiased watermarks.
Our experiments with widely-used language models demonstrate an improvement in
detectability of over 10% using MCmark, compared to existing state-of-the-art
unbiased watermarks. This advancement underscores MCmark's potential in

Motivation: To enhance authorship attribution by leveraging diverse linguistic features from transformer layers, addressing robustness in out-of-domain data.

Method: Utilizes linguistic representations from various layers of pre-trained transformer models, evaluated on three datasets against a baseline.

Result: Improved robustness and state-of-the-art performance in out-of-domain scenarios, with insights into layer specialization for stylistic features.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages transformer layers for better authorship attribution, particularly in challenging out-of-domain cases.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for the authorship attribution task that leverages
the various linguistic representations learned at different layers of
pre-trained transformer-based models. We evaluate our approach on three
datasets, comparing it to a state-of-the-art baseline in in-domain and
out-of-domain scenarios. We found that utilizing various transformer layers
improves the robustness of authorship attribution models when tested on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-modal Commander-GPT framework for sarcasm detection, achieving a 19.3% F1 score improvement without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-modal sarcasm detection methods are inadequate due to sarcasm's implicit nature, prompting exploration of multi-modal approaches.

Method: Proposes a Commander-GPT framework, decomposing sarcasm detection into six sub-tasks, each handled by a specialized large language model, with results aggregated.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 19.3% F1 score improvement on MMSD and MMSD 2.0 datasets.

Conclusion: The Commander-GPT framework effectively leverages multi-modal information for sarcasm detection, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection, as a crucial research direction in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP), has attracted widespread attention. Traditional
sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches
(e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such
methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers
have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However,
effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic
content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the
powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative
multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first
decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central
commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to
address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each
model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on
MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six
prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without
necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

TL;DR: SMARTe is a slot-based method for relational triple extraction that emphasizes interpretability without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RTE research focused on performance, lacking insights into model mechanisms, leading to opaque systems. SMARTe addresses this by introducing interpretability.

Method: SMARTe uses slot attention to consolidate information into distinct slots, framing RTE as a set prediction problem for traceable predictions.

Result: SMARTe matches state-of-the-art performance on NYT and WebNLG datasets while providing interpretability via attention heatmaps.

Conclusion: SMARTe successfully balances interpretability and performance, with potential for future research in explainable NLP.

Abstract: Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing
model performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms
driving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to
induce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not
fully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations,
we propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple
extraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot
attention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot
attention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all
predictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the
tokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing
interpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
models. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding
interpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted
qualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using
attention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a
discussion of our findings and propose directions for future research. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Chen-XueWen/SMARTe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarce visual-language CoT data limits VLM reasoning; game code offers a scalable, cost-effective solution.

Method: Leverage LLMs to adapt game code for automatic reasoning data generation via code execution.

Result: GameQA dataset (30 games, 158 tasks) improves Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 2.33% across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Code2Logic provides a scalable, effective method for enhancing VLM reasoning with game-derived data.

Abstract: Visual-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data resources are relatively scarce
compared to text-only counterparts, limiting the improvement of reasoning
capabilities in Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, high-quality
vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To
address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which
naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes.
Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for
multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning
processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we
developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is
cost-effective and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is
diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on
game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically
Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language
benchmarks. Our code, dataset and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving consistent performance across languages and integrating cultural knowledge in MLLMs.

Method: Introducing two benchmarks: KnowRecall (for factual knowledge consistency) and VisRecall (for visual memory consistency), tested in multiple languages.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, fail to achieve cross-lingual consistency.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust approaches to develop truly multilingual and culturally aware MLLMs.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Conclusion: The innovations bridge the performance gap with autoregressive models, enabling practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities.
However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often
lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and
quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism
tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with
negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of
generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token
dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we
propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes
tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and
maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models
across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$
throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap
with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of
Diffusion LLMs.

### [48] [Enhancing Clinical Multiple-Choice Questions Benchmarks with Knowledge Graph Guided Distractor Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00612)
*Running Yang, Wenlong Deng, Minghui Chen, Yuyin Zhou, Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided data augmentation framework (KGGDG) is introduced to enhance clinical MCQ datasets by generating plausible but misleading distractors, reducing LLM accuracy for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the evaluation of LLMs in clinical decision-making by creating more challenging and realistic MCQ datasets.

Method: Multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph to generate clinically plausible yet incorrect distractors.

Result: Applied to six medical QA benchmarks, KGGDG consistently lowers the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: KGGDG is effective for robust and diagnostic evaluations of medical LLMs.

Abstract: Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making
abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to
assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we
introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the
difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating
distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and
may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices
are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach
involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph
to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but
factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive
distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation
(KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it
consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings
establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic
evaluations of medical LLMs.

*Fariz Ikhwantri, Dusica Marijan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EXCLAIM, an NLI-based method for explainable compliance detection in assurance cases, addressing challenges like complex texts and limited data by using LLMs for case generation and multi-hop inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in validating assurance cases include complex legal/technical texts, need for explanations, and limited data access.

Method: EXCLAIM uses NLI for multi-hop inference, generates assurance cases with LLMs, and introduces coverage/consistency metrics.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness with GDPR requirements, showing NLI's potential for automating compliance.

Conclusion: NLI-based approaches like EXCLAIM can automate and improve regulatory compliance processes.

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

*Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Bernd Wei√ü, Jessica Daikeler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using LLMs for coding open-ended German survey responses, comparing performance across models and prompting methods, with fine-tuning yielding the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can efficiently replace manual coding or supervised models for non-English, complex survey responses.

Method: Comparison of state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting approaches, evaluated against human expert codings.

Result: Performance varies by LLM; fine-tuned models achieve satisfactory accuracy. Prompting effectiveness depends on the LLM. Uneven performance across categories affects distributions.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential but require careful selection and fine-tuning for reliable use in survey research, with trade-offs in method choice.

Abstract: The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred
discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including
classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it
is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual
coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most
existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses
relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its
findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to
established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different
LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using
German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare
several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate
the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance
differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory
levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting
approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal
classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey
participation results in different categorical distributions when not using
fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for
methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their
substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively
analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need
to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response
classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the
growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be
efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

TL;DR: The paper explores optimization in LLMs using information geometry, highlighting natural gradient descent and its insights into training phenomena. It also speculates on quantum analogies for efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve optimization in high-dimensional, non-Euclidean parameter spaces of LLMs using geometric principles.

Method: Uses information geometry, particularly the Fisher information metric, to analyze and guide learning via natural gradient descent.

Result: Provides insights into sharp minima, generalization, and scaling laws in LLM training.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware methods enhance LLM training understanding, with potential quantum analogies offering future optimization efficiencies.

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient
optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate robustness of text classification systems by discovering minimal adversarial modifications.

Method: Extended BeamAttack with word deletions, skip substitutions, and LIME for word replacement prioritization, tested on BiLSTM, BERT, and RoBERTa.

Result: Over 99% attack success rate while maintaining semantic and lexical similarity.

Conclusion: BeamAttack is effective but has limitations; implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's
effectiveness and its limitations. Our implementation is available at

*Tao Xiong, Xavier Hu, Wenyan Fan, Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mixture of Reasoning (MoR) is a framework for embedding diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs, eliminating the need for task-specific prompts and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on manually crafted, task-specific prompts, limiting adaptability and efficiency. MoR aims to enable autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning.

Method: MoR involves two phases: Thought Generation (creating reasoning chain templates) and SFT Dataset Construction (pairing templates with datasets for supervised fine-tuning).

Result: MoR improves performance, e.g., MoR150 achieves 0.730 (2.2% improvement) with CoT and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) over baselines.

Conclusion: MoR provides a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across tasks without task-specific prompts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning. Our experiments show that MoR significantly
enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT
prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates
the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for
robust reasoning across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of physics reasoning for LLMs by leveraging advanced reasoning models and evaluating their performance on diverse physics problems.

Method: Application of instruction-tuned reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek-R1) to solve physics problems from SciBench, with few-shot prompting for enhancement.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy in physics problem-solving, with distinctive symbolic reasoning patterns and measurable improvements from few-shot prompting.

Conclusion: Advanced reasoning models show great potential in physics reasoning, with strategic prompting further enhancing their capabilities.

Abstract: Navigating the complexities of physics reasoning has long been a difficult
task for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring a synthesis of profound
conceptual understanding and adept problem-solving techniques. In this study,
we investigate the application of advanced instruction-tuned reasoning models,
such as Deepseek-R1, to address a diverse spectrum of physics problems curated
from the challenging SciBench benchmark. Our comprehensive experimental
evaluation reveals the remarkable capabilities of reasoning models. Not only do
they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics
questions, but they also generate distinctive reasoning patterns that emphasize
on symbolic derivation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that even for these
highly sophisticated reasoning models, the strategic incorporation of few-shot
prompting can still yield measurable improvements in overall accuracy,
highlighting the potential for continued performance gains.

*Chris Yuhao Liu, Liang Zeng, Yuzhen Xiao, Jujie He, Jiacai Liu, Chaojie Wang, Rui Yan, Wei Shen, Fuxiang Zhang, Jiacheng Xu, Yang Liu, Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynPref-40M, a large-scale preference dataset, and Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of reward models, to address limitations in current reward models by leveraging human-AI synergy for high-quality data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models perform poorly due to limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrow, synthetic, or lack quality control.

Method: A human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline is designed for data curation, combining human annotation quality with AI scalability. Skywork-Reward-V2 models are trained on a curated subset of SynPref-40M.

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks, demonstrating versatility in alignment, correctness, safety, and bias resistance.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the potential of human-AI synergy for high-quality data curation and advances open reward models.

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

### [56] [Decision-Oriented Text Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01923)
*Yu-Shiang Huang, Chuan-Ju Wang, Chung-Chi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision-oriented framework for evaluating NLG by measuring its impact on human and LLM decision outcomes, showing traditional metrics are inadequate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLG evaluation methods (e.g., n-gram overlap) poorly correlate with real-world decision-making efficacy, necessitating a more practical approach.

Method: The study uses market digest texts (morning summaries and closing-bell analyses) to evaluate decision quality based on financial performance of human investors and LLM agents.

Result: Neither humans nor LLMs outperformed random baselines with summaries alone, but human-LLM collaboration with richer analyses significantly improved performance.

Conclusion: Evaluating NLG by its ability to enhance human-LLM collaborative decision-making is crucial, exposing flaws in traditional intrinsic metrics.

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

*Zijie Cai, Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking and improving monocular metric depth estimation in underwater environments using domain adaptation and synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of monocular depth estimation underwater due to domain shifts and lack of high-quality ground-truth data.

Method: Evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned models on underwater datasets (FLSea, SQUID), fine-tuned Depth Anything V2 with synthetic underwater data.

Result: Fine-tuned model outperforms baselines, showing the importance of domain adaptation and synthetic data for robust underwater depth estimation.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision are crucial for accurate monocular metric depth estimation in underwater environments.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESTR-CoT, a novel chain-of-thought reasoning framework for event stream scene text recognition, addressing interpretability and contextual reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for event stream text recognition lack interpretability and contextual reasoning, limiting performance in challenging scenarios like low illumination and fast motion.

Method: The framework uses EVA-CLIP for vision encoding, Llama tokenizer for prompt encoding, and Vicuna-7B for reasoning, optimized via supervised fine-tuning. A large-scale CoT dataset is also introduced.

Result: Experiments on EventSTR, WordArt*, and IC15* datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and interpretability.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT improves event stream text recognition with enhanced reasoning and interpretability, supported by a new dataset and open-source release.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

TL;DR: A zero-shot multimodal approach for Compound Expression Recognition (CER) combines six modalities and achieves comparable results to supervised methods without domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic emotions without relying on task-specific training data.

Method: Uses zero-shot components like CLIP-based label matching and Qwen-VL, with a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF) module and Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 46.95% (AffWild2), 49.02% (AFEW), and 34.85% (C-EXPR-DB) in zero-shot testing.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures compound emotions without domain adaptation, demonstrating its potential for CER.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

*Feizhen Huang, Yu Wu, Yutian Lin, Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-distillation method improves Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation by incorporating cinematic language, enhancing performance in partial visibility scenarios and on the VGGSound dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods ignore cinematic language, limiting their effectiveness in artistic filmmaking, especially when Foley targets are partially visible.

Method: Proposes a self-distillation approach where a student model learns to align video features with audio-visual correspondences by simulating cinematic language variations.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in partial visibility scenarios and boosts performance on the VGGSound dataset.

Conclusion: The method successfully integrates cinematic language into V2A generation, improving robustness and performance.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

TL;DR: SciGA-145k is a dataset for Graphical Abstracts (GAs) research, introducing tasks for GA recommendation and a new metric (CAR) to improve scientific communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of GAs in scientific communication and the barrier of design skills, SciGA-145k aims to support GA selection and automated generation.

Method: The paper introduces SciGA-145k, a dataset with 145k papers and 1.14M figures, and defines two tasks: Intra-GA and Inter-GA recommendation. Baseline models and a new metric (CAR) are proposed.

Result: The dataset and tasks provide a foundation for GA research, with CAR offering a refined analysis of recommendation models.

Conclusion: SciGA-145k advances visual scientific communication and contributes to AI for Science by addressing GA challenges.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

Abstract: The compression of real-world scanned 3D human dynamic meshes is an emerging
research area, driven by applications such as telepresence, virtual reality,
and 3D digital streaming. Unlike synthesized dynamic meshes with fixed
topology, scanned dynamic meshes often not only have varying topology across
frames but also scan defects such as holes and outliers, increasing the
complexity of prediction and compression. Additionally, human meshes often
combine rigid and non-rigid motions, making accurate prediction and encoding
significantly more difficult compared to objects that exhibit purely rigid
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a compression method designed
for real-world scanned human dynamic meshes, leveraging embedded key nodes. The
temporal motion of each vertex is formulated as a distance-weighted combination
of transformations from neighboring key nodes, requiring the transmission of
solely the key nodes' transformations. To enhance the quality of the
KeyNode-driven prediction, we introduce an octree-based residual coding scheme
and a Dual-direction prediction mode, which uses I-frames from both directions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art, with an average bitrate savings of
58.43% across the evaluated sequences, particularly excelling at low bitrates.

*Brandon Trabucco, Qasim Wani, Benjamin Pikus, Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using diffusion models to generate synthetic data for training object detectors, comparing prompt-based and layout-based conditioning. Layout conditioning outperforms as diversity increases, significantly improving detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited training data in industrial vision systems, the paper investigates synthetic data generation to reduce reliance on time-consuming real data collection.

Method: The study compares two conditioning strategies (prompt-based and layout-based) for diffusion models across 80 visual concepts from four benchmarks.

Result: Layout conditioning excels with diverse cues, boosting mean average precision by up to 177% compared to real data alone.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with layout conditioning offer a scalable solution for high-quality synthetic data, enhancing object detection performance.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

*Yuxiang Zhang, Wei Li, Wen Jia, Mengmeng Zhang, Ran Tao, Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification, enhancing adaptability and separability by extracting domain-invariant and domain-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spectral shifts in hyperspectral images from different regions or times, improving classification accuracy.

Method: Uses a triple-branch transformer with semantic tokenizer, coupled multi-head cross-attention, bi-directional distillation loss, and adaptive reinforcement strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3-5% in cross-temporal tree species classification.

Conclusion: BiDA effectively handles spectral shifts and noise, improving cross-domain HSI classification.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT is a novel binary vision transformer that addresses performance degradation and reliance on full-precision modules in existing methods, achieving superior results in image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the trade-off between computational demands and edge-device constraints in vision transformers while avoiding severe performance loss.

Method: Incorporates an informative attention module with differential information, frequency decomposition via Haar wavelet, and an improved RPReLU activation function.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods in image classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT effectively balances efficiency and performance in binary ViTs, offering a practical solution for edge deployment.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep-learning architecture using residual U-Net models and an ensemble meta-model improves structural crack detection accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crack detection is slow and error-prone, risking public safety. This study aims to enhance reliability through automation.

Method: Residual U-Net models were integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model of convolutional blocks, evaluated against SegNet and traditional U-Net.

Result: The ensemble model outperformed individual models, achieving the highest IoU and DICE scores, especially with low-resolution images.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble model offers a more reliable solution for automated structural crack detection.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

*Jiangxia Chen, Tongyuan Huang, Ke Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by refining features with flow matching and selective filtering, outperforming existing methods with fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction rely on historical frame data, requiring extra resources. FMOcc addresses this by enhancing accuracy for occluded and distant scenes with fewer frames.

Method: FMOcc uses a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement network with flow matching (FMSSM) and selective filtering (PS3M) to refine features and reduce redundancy. Mask Training (MT) is added for robustness.

Result: FMOcc achieves 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes, and 42.6% RayIoU on OpenOcc, with efficient resource usage (5.4 G memory, 330ms inference time).

Conclusion: FMOcc is a resource-efficient solution for accurate 3D occupancy prediction, particularly for occluded and distant scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

TL;DR: SurgVisAgent, an intelligent surgical vision agent using multimodal large language models, enhances endoscopic images by dynamically identifying distortions and performing multiple enhancement tasks, outperforming single-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing enhancement algorithms for surgical interventions are limited to single tasks, reducing their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. SurgVisAgent aims to address this by offering a versatile solution.

Method: The agent uses multimodal large language models, a prior model for domain-specific knowledge, in-context few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning to customize enhancements for various distortions.

Result: Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark show SurgVisAgent outperforms traditional single-task models, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse surgical scenarios.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent presents a unified and adaptable solution for surgical image enhancement, addressing the limitations of single-task models and meeting diverse surgeon requirements.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

### [70] [F^2TTA: Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation on Cross-Domain Medical Image Classification via Image-Level Disentangled Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02437)
*Wei Li, Jingyang Zhang, Lihao Liu, Guoan Wang, Junjun He, Yang Chen, Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F¬≤TTA) for adapting models to domain fragments in medical imaging, proposing Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) with Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) to handle unpredictable shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting models to domain fragments in clinical practice, where data arrives unpredictably and in arbitrary lengths, unlike existing TTA methods that assume complete domain units.

Method: Proposes I-DiPT with UoM for masked consistency learning and PGD for reusing historical prompt knowledge via parallel graph networks.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in breast cancer and glaucoma classification compared to existing TTA methods.

Conclusion: I-DiPT effectively handles unpredictable domain shifts in F¬≤TTA, improving adaptation in medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label methods fail to capture the complexity of hurricane damage, necessitating a more accurate and timely assessment for effective disaster response.

Method: The framework integrates ResNet-based feature extraction and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types in a single image.

Result: Achieves 90.23% mean average precision on the Rescuenet dataset from Hurricane Michael, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances damage assessment, enabling targeted disaster response and contributing to future mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version

### [72] [IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02445)
*Hailong Yan, Junjian Huang, Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet is a zero-shot method for underexposed image enhancement, requiring no training data or priors. It decomposes images into illumination and reflection components and denoises them, outperforming 14 unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods need paired datasets, which are hard to collect, and may over-enhance images. IGDNet avoids these issues by working on single images without training.

Method: IGDNet uses a decomposition module (dense connection network) to separate illumination and reflection, and a denoising module (pixel adaptive correction) to enhance regions. Noise pairs are refined iteratively.

Result: IGDNet achieves PSNR of 20.41dB and SSIM of 0.860dB, outperforming 14 state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on four datasets.

Conclusion: IGDNet is a practical, high-performing zero-shot solution for underexposed image enhancement, with strong generalization and noise suppression.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: Underwater images suffer from visibility and color issues due to environmental factors, and existing methods (prior-based, pixel-based, or deep learning) are insufficient.

Method: Proposes MAC-Lookup with Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for initial correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.

Result: MAC-Lookup effectively enhances underwater images, restoring details and colors better than existing methods, without over-enhancement or saturation.

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup is a robust solution for underwater image enhancement, addressing key challenges and outperforming current approaches.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater

TL;DR: LaCo introduces layer-wise visual token compression within vision encoder intermediate layers, outperforming existing methods and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods for MLLMs are post-encoder, limiting efficiency gains. LaCo addresses this by compressing tokens within the encoder.

Method: LaCo uses a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism and residual learning with non-parametric shortcuts to merge tokens and preserve visual information.

Result: LaCo outperforms existing methods, improves training efficiency by over 20%, and boosts inference throughput by over 15% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: LaCo is a superior framework for visual token compression, enhancing efficiency and performance in MLLMs.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for domain generalization (DG) using text feature-guided visual prompt tuning and introduces WERA to enhance visual representation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing prompts that disentangle invariant features across diverse domains in DG, leveraging the controllable language prompt of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs).

Method: Uses a large language model (LLM) to disentangle text prompts, then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by these text features. Introduces WERA for additional abstract prompts and alignment constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods on major datasets like PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances domain generalization by combining text-guided visual prompts and WERA, addressing limitations of language-only guidance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRefSAM enhances SAM for remote sensing by automating prompts and adapting to domain-specific features using few-shot learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with manual prompt inefficiency and domain adaptability in remote sensing, especially for dense or novel objects.

Method: ViRefSAM introduces a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder and Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to automate prompts and align domain-specific features.

Result: ViRefSAM achieves accurate segmentation of unseen classes with few reference images, outperforming benchmarks on iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM effectively addresses SAM's limitations in remote sensing, enabling efficient and accurate segmentation without manual prompts.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with controllable novel view generation due to limited multi-view information.

Method: Uses a view-aware 3D lifting module and multi-view feature fusion to integrate 3D representations into diffusion models.

Result: Improves controllability and quality of novel view synthesis, enabling better 3D object reconstruction.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ advances controllable novel view generation and broadens applications in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

*Haoxuan Li, Chenxu Wei, Haodong Wang, Xiaomeng Hu, Boyuan An, Lingyan Ran, Baosen Zhang, Jin Jin, Omirzhan Taukebayev, Amirkhan Temirbayev, Junrui Liu, Xiuwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow-CDNet is a novel change detection network that detects both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images using two branches: optical flow for displacement changes and a ResNet-based branch for fast changes. It outperforms existing methods on the Flow-Change dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow changes in bitemporal images are precursors to major hazards, but existing methods focus on significant changes. Detecting both slow and fast changes is crucial for real-life scenarios like slopes and dams.

Method: Flow-CDNet combines an optical flow branch (for multi-scale displacement changes) and a ResNet-based branch (for fast changes). It uses a custom dataset (Flow-Change), a hybrid loss function (binary tversky + L2 norm), and a new metric (FEPE).

Result: Quantitative experiments show Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm mutual enhancement between the two branches.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet effectively detects both slow and fast changes, validated by superior performance and branch synergy.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

### [79] [LMPNet for Weakly-supervised Keypoint Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02308)
*Pei Guo, Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMPNet discovers semantic keypoints weakly-supervised by category labels using a leaky max pooling layer and a clustering approach, achieving accuracy comparable to supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover semantic object keypoints without strong supervision, relying only on category labels.

Method: Uses leaky max pooling (LMP) to encourage non-repeatable local patterns, a selection strategy for consistency, and a clustering layer for keypoint grouping.

Result: LMPNet discovers robust keypoints and matches supervised model accuracy.

Conclusion: The method is interpretable and effective for weakly-supervised keypoint discovery.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

*Le Xu, Qi Zhang, Qixian Zhang, Hongyun Zhang, Duoqian Miao, Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using fMRI representations to improve semantic alignment in brain-vision decoding, enhancing object detection and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain-vision decoding methods lack fine-grained semantic alignment, leading to distorted reconstructions of semantic objects. The study aims to better understand visual perception and improve decoding models.

Method: An experimental framework injects fMRI representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, evaluating downstream performance on object detection and segmentation tasks.

Result: Incorporating fMRI signals improves detection and segmentation accuracy, revealing rich multi-object semantic cues and spatial localization information.

Conclusion: fMRI data contains valuable semantic and spatial information not fully utilized by current models, offering potential for enhanced brain-vision decoding.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

### [81] [MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02314)
*JaeHyuck Choi, MinJun Kim, JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC is a novel method for few-shot anomaly generation in industrial quality control, addressing three key demands: preserving normal backgrounds, precise anomaly inpainting, and semantically valid anomaly placement. It outperforms existing methods on the MVTec-AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing diffusion-based methods, which fail to simultaneously meet the demands of background preservation, precise anomaly inpainting, and semantic validity in anomaly placement.

Method: MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone, incorporates Gaussian prompt-level perturbation and mask-guided spatial noise injection for diversity, and uses a context-aware mask alignment module for semantic validity.

Result: MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in downstream anomaly tasks on the MVTec-AD dataset.

Conclusion: MAGIC effectively resolves the three key challenges in few-shot anomaly generation, offering a robust solution for industrial quality control.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

*Zecheng Zhao, Selena Song, Tong Chen, Zhi Chen, Shazia Sadiq, Yadan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynTVA introduces a dataset and benchmark to evaluate synthetic videos' utility in text-to-video retrieval, focusing on semantic alignment and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V metrics lack insight into downstream tasks like TVR, prompting the need for a dedicated evaluation framework.

Method: SynTVA uses 800 user queries to generate synthetic videos, annotating them for semantic alignment. It correlates VQA metrics with alignment scores and develops an Auto-Evaluator.

Result: SynTVA improves TVR outcomes by selecting high-utility synthetic samples and serves as a dataset augmentation tool.

Conclusion: SynTVA is a valuable benchmark for evaluating synthetic videos' downstream utility and enhancing retrieval models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

### [83] [PAD: Phase-Amplitude Decoupling Fusion for Multi-Modal Land Cover Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19136)
*Huiling Zheng, Xian Zhong, Bin Liu, Yi Xiao, Bihan Wen, Xiaofeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAD is a frequency-aware framework for SAR and RGB fusion, decoupling phase and amplitude to improve land cover classification by enhancing shared structures and complementary features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with modality heterogeneity and underutilized spectral complementarity, leading to feature conflicts and information loss.

Method: PAD decouples phase (shared) and amplitude (complementary) in the Fourier domain, using Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC) and Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF) for geometric consistency and dynamic feature integration.

Result: PAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets.

Conclusion: PAD introduces a physics-aware paradigm for multi-modal fusion, improving remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover
classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and
underutilized spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to decouple
shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes,
causing feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose
Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates
phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in
the Fourier domain, thus reinforcing shared structures while preserving
complementary characteristics to improve fusion quality. Unlike prior
approaches that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency
spectra, PAD is the first to introduce explicit amplitude-phase decoupling for
multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase
Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via
convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude
Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency and
low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons,
leveraging SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness.
Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available

*Nina Konovalova, Maxim Nikolaev, Andrey Kuznetsov, Aibek Alanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InnerControl improves spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models by enforcing consistency across all denoising steps, outperforming prior methods like ControlNet++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ lack spatial consistency in intermediate generation stages, limiting control fidelity.

Method: InnerControl trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct control signals from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step, using pseudo ground truth for training.

Result: The method enhances control fidelity and generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance with diverse conditioning methods.

Conclusion: InnerControl, combined with techniques like ControlNet++, provides superior spatial control in diffusion models.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

### [85] [Customizable ROI-Based Deep Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00373)
*Jian Jin, Fanxin Xia, Feng Ding, Xinfeng Zhang, Meiqin Liu, Yao Zhao, Weisi Lin, Lili Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A customizable ROI-based deep image compression method is proposed, allowing users to define ROI via text and manage quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ROI-based compression lacks flexibility for diverse user preferences and fixed ROI definitions.

Method: Introduces Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA), Customizable Value Assign (CVA), and Latent Mask Attention (LMA) modules for flexible ROI customization and quality management.

Result: The method effectively supports customizable ROI definition and quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm successfully addresses customization needs in ROI-based image compression.

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by
prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users
(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,
ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various
preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require
different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image
compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack
effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.
This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image
compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,
which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just
inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder
controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)
mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users
instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off
between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)
module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent
Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused
in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of
the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses
the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as
the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

*Farida Siddiqi Prity, Mirza Raquib, Saydul Akbar Murad, Md. Jubayar Alam Rafi, Md. Khairul Bashar Bhuiyan, Anupam Kumar Bairagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ANN-based Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) for rice leaf disease classification, outperforming the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of rice leaf diseases is crucial for productivity and economic stability, but existing methods lack thorough comparative analysis of feature extraction techniques.

Method: The study compares FADM (using FEAs, DRAs, FSAs, and ELM) with DICDM (no FEAs) on datasets of six rice leaf conditions, evaluated via 10-fold Cross-Validation.

Result: FADM achieves superior classification performance over DICDM, demonstrating its effectiveness in disease detection.

Conclusion: FADM shows promise for improving rice farming sustainability by enhancing disease detection and reducing yield losses.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

*Rafic Nader, Vincent L'Allinec, Romain Bourcier, Florent Autrusseau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-step neural network approach is introduced for automated detection of Circle of Willis bifurcations, improving accuracy and reducing missed detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of intracranial aneurysm-prone bifurcations is crucial for efficient diagnosis, but challenges like anatomical variability and similar visual characteristics complicate the process.

Method: A two-step process: an object detection network identifies ROIs, followed by a modified U-Net with deep supervision for precise bifurcation localization.

Result: The method outperforms others in bifurcation detection, validated on both an in-house and a public MRA dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses challenges in landmark detection, offering high performance for clinical applications.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

TL;DR: A lightweight YOLOv8n-based model with RLDD detection head and C2f-EMCM module improves shrimp disease detection, reducing parameters by 32.3% and achieving 92.7% mAP@0.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shrimp diseases cause economic losses; efficient, accurate detection is needed.

Method: Proposes YOLOv8n-based architecture with RLDD head, C2f-EMCM module, and SegNext_Attention for feature extraction.

Result: 32.3% fewer parameters, 92.7% mAP@0.5 (3% improvement), outperforms other lightweight models.

Conclusion: Balances accuracy and efficiency, offering reliable shrimp disease detection.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

*Anlin Zheng, Haochen Wang, Yucheng Zhao, Weipeng Deng, Tiancai Wang, Xiangyu Zhang, Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hita is a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive image generation, improving global information capture and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of vanilla autoregressive models in capturing holistic relationships and global information in image tokenization.

Method: Introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable queries, sequential structure, and a lightweight fusion module for information flow control.

Result: Achieves 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on ImageNet, with improved training speed and effectiveness in style transfer and in-painting.

Conclusion: Hita enhances autoregressive image generation by better capturing global properties and outperforms vanilla tokenizers.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocalDyGS introduces a novel framework for dynamic scene reconstruction, handling both large-scale and fine-scale motions by decomposing scenes into local spaces and decoupling static/dynamic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like neural radiance fields or 3D Gaussian splatting struggle with complex, highly dynamic motions, limiting their application.

Method: Decomposes scenes into local spaces with seeds and decouples static/dynamic features. Combines these to generate Temporal Gaussians for motion modeling.

Result: Competes with SOTA on fine-scale datasets and pioneers modeling of larger, complex dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS advances dynamic scene reconstruction, offering realistic modeling of highly dynamic real-world scenes.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UVLM, an underwater observation benchmark for video language models (VidLMs), addressing gaps in existing terrestrial-focused works. It ensures data quality, diversity, and task variety, with experiments showing improved underwater understanding and slight gains on in-air benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VidLMs overlook underwater observation needs despite their demanding applications. The paper aims to bridge this gap by creating a specialized benchmark.

Method: UVLM is built collaboratively with human expertise and AI, focusing on underwater challenges (light, turbidity, angles), data diversity (frame rates, resolutions, species), and task diversity (20 types). Evaluation metrics are designed for quantitative analysis.

Result: Fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM improves underwater understanding and shows slight gains on in-air benchmarks like VideoMME and Perception text.

Conclusion: UVLM addresses a critical gap in VidLM applications, offering a robust benchmark for underwater scenarios with potential broader impacts.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

TL;DR: A novel pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) using video data, robust to occlusion and scalable without multi-view setups or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity in M3OD, overcoming limitations of existing weakly supervised and pseudo-labeling methods.

Method: Aggregates pseudo-LiDARs of static and dynamic objects across frames via object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction without additional sensors or poses.

Result: Ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is practical and effective for M3OD, offering a robust solution without domain-specific constraints.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Xiangfeng Wang, Xiao Li, Yadong Wei, Xueyu Song, Yang Song, Xiaoqiang Xia, Fangrui Zeng, Zaiyi Chen, Liu Liu, Gu Xu, Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIVE, a human-inspired video editing framework using multimodal narrative understanding to improve coherence and quality in automatic video editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient video editing techniques is growing, but existing methods often neglect visual context, leading to incoherent outputs.

Method: HIVE incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization via multimodal large language models, along with scene-level segmentation and three subtasks: highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning.

Result: HIVE outperforms existing baselines, narrowing the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos, as demonstrated on the DramaAD dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering a more coherent and high-quality solution for automatic video editing.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

*Byung Hyun Lee, Wongi Jeong, Woojae Han, Kyoungbun Lee, Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMEL introduces a continual MIL framework for localization with minimal forgetting, outperforming prior methods by up to 23.4% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of adaptability in MIL for continual tasks, especially in instance classification for localization in large-scale images like WSIs.

Method: Proposes CoMEL with GDAT for instance encoding, BPPL for pseudo-labeling, and OWLoRA to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by up to 11.00% in bag-level and 23.4% in localization accuracy.

Conclusion: CoMEL effectively addresses continual MIL challenges, enhancing localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

*Taehoon Kim, Jongwook Choi, Yonghyun Jeong, Haeun Noh, Jaejun Yoo, Seungryul Baek, Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deepfake detection method using pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies, outperforming traditional spatial frequency-based detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detectors miss temporal artifacts by focusing on spatial frequency spectra. This work aims to exploit pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies for better detection.

Method: Uses 1D Fourier transform on the time axis per pixel, an attention proposal module, and a joint transformer to integrate temporal and spatio-temporal features.

Result: Robust performance in diverse deepfake detection scenarios, detecting unnatural movements more effectively.

Conclusion: The framework advances deepfake detection by addressing overlooked temporal inconsistencies, improving accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

*Ziqi Miao, Yi Ding, Lijun Li, Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisCo Attack, a visual-centric jailbreak method for MLLMs, achieving high toxicity and success rates by dynamically generating contextual dialogue and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security vulnerabilities in MLLMs by defining a novel visual-centric jailbreak setting, as existing methods lack realism and grounding.

Method: Proposes VisCo Attack, using four visual-focused strategies, automatic toxicity obfuscation, and semantic refinement to craft effective prompts.

Result: Achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and 85% ASR on MM-SafetyBench, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: VisCo demonstrates significant effectiveness in exploiting MLLM vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for improved security measures.

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

*Peilin Zhang, Shaouxan Wua, Jun Feng, Zhuo Jin, Zhizezhang Gao, Jingkun Chen, Yaqiong Xing, Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAB Net, a weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, uses triplet augmentation and boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision to improve scribble-based segmentation, achieving results close to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble annotations are cost-effective but sparse, limiting feature learning and boundary supervision in medical image segmentation.

Method: TAB Net includes the TAS module (triplet augmentation for feature learning) and the BAP module (boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision for accuracy).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art scribble-based methods on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets, nearing fully supervised performance.

Conclusion: TAB Net effectively addresses scribble annotation limitations, offering a practical solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification, showing it outperforms supervised methods in robustness and performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife re-identification relies on annotated data, which is labor-intensive. SSL offers a way to leverage unlabeled data for training.

Method: Uses temporal image pairs from camera traps to train SSL models without supervision, then evaluates them on open-world and transfer learning tasks.

Result: SSL models are more robust with limited data and outperform supervised features in all downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SSL is a promising alternative to supervised learning for wildlife re-identification, reducing reliance on labeled data.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper integrates an encoder with a diffusion model to create an auto-encoding framework, enabling structured latent spaces for brain image analysis and unsupervised artifact restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack explicit semantic representation extraction, unlike auto-encoders. Combining them aims to organize latent spaces and improve applications like brain image analysis and artifact restoration.

Method: The approach integrates an encoder with a diffusion model, structures latent spaces for brain images, and uses neighborhood awareness and representational guidance for unsupervised artifact restoration.

Result: The method successfully structures latent spaces for brain tissue differentiation and restores tear and JPEG artifacts without supervision.

Conclusion: The integration of auto-encoding with diffusion models enhances semantic representation and enables unsupervised artifact restoration, broadening diffusion model applications.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

TL;DR: A novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking in thermal images optimizes hyperparameters for high accuracy without complex models, proving effective in real-world surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal images improve surveillance in low-visibility conditions, but their low-level features challenge accurate pedestrian tracking.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage tuning method for hyperparameters, tailored for thermal imagery's complex motion patterns.

Result: The method achieves high tracking accuracy on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset, performing well across various thermal camera conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a robust solution for real-time pedestrian tracking in thermal surveillance systems.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

TL;DR: Proposes PFIP, a scheme for efficient face retrieval in ciphertext domain, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of time-intensive face retrieval in ciphertext domain due to growing template libraries.

Method: Introduces PFIP with a preselection mechanism and packing module to enhance efficiency and flexibility.

Result: Achieves 100% hit rate, retrieves 1,000 ciphertext templates in 300ms, and improves efficiency by 50x.

Conclusion: PFIP is a novel, efficient solution for privacy-preserving face identification with high accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

*Yiming Zhong, Xiaolin Zhang, Ligang Liu, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarMakeup is a 3D makeup method using a diffusion model for realistic, consistent, and detailed makeup transfer on avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian editing methods lack realism, consistency, and identity preservation for avatar makeup.

Method: Leverages a pretrained diffusion model for makeup transfer, uses Coherent Duplication for consistency, and a Refinement Module for detail enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality and consistency in animations.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods for 3D avatar makeup.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots slow down for object detection due to low camera framerates, increasing task time. Existing tools like Vitis-AI underutilize FPGA potential.

Method: Deployed three quantized ANNs (MobileNet v1 4-bit, CNV 2-bit, BNN 1-bit) on FPGA using FINN architecture, trained on the RG2C dataset.

Result: MobileNet v1 achieved 98% success rate and 6611 FPS, proving FPGA acceleration for ANNs in attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: FPGAs can effectively speed up ANNs for robotic attention mechanisms, improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme for moving infrared small target detection, reducing reliance on manual annotations and achieving performance close to fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for infrared small target detection is costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for non-fully supervised methods to reduce annotation requirements.

Method: The WeCoL scheme uses target quantity prompts, integrates target activation maps and multi-frame energy accumulation via SAM, employs contrastive learning for pseudo-label reliability, and models motion patterns with long-short term learning.

Result: Experiments on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets show WeCoL outperforms early fully-supervised methods and reaches over 90% of SOTA fully-supervised performance.

Conclusion: WeCoL demonstrates the viability of weakly-supervised learning for infrared small target detection, offering a practical alternative to costly manual annotation.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Motivation: Existing mesh tokenization methods waste network capability with repeated vertex tokens. Mesh Silksong aims to eliminate redundancy and improve geometric integrity.

Method: Tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each only once, reducing sequence redundancy. Auto-regressively generates polygon meshes akin to silk weaving.

Result: Achieves 50% redundancy reduction, 22% compression rate, and superior geometric properties (manifold topology, watertightness, consistent normals).

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong is effective for intricate mesh generation with improved geometric integrity, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the

compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,

practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset, CrowdTrack, for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex scenarios, addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack complexity and realism, hindering research on robust tracking methods in challenging environments.

Method: A large-scale dataset (33 videos, 5,185 trajectories) is created with first-person views and real-life scenarios, annotated with bounding boxes and unique IDs.

Result: The dataset enables testing of SOTA models and foundation models, providing insights into their performance in complex situations.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack fills a gap in current datasets, offering a valuable resource for developing and evaluating robust tracking algorithms.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Method: Introduces MedFormer with a pyramid scaling structure for versatility and DSSA for efficient, noise-robust attention.

Result: Demonstrates superior generality and efficiency, enhancing performance in classification, segmentation, and lesion detection.

Conclusion: MedFormer is a highly effective solution for diverse medical image recognition tasks, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

*Luca Parolari, Andrea Cherubini, Lamberto Ballan, Carlo Biffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised contrastive loss method for polyp counting in colonoscopy, emphasizing temporal awareness to improve clustering and reduce fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated polyp counting enhances colonoscopy reporting and quality control, but existing methods neglect temporal relationships, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes a supervised contrastive loss with temporally-aware soft targets and integrates a temporal adjacency constraint for tracklet clustering.

Result: Achieves a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior methods, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is crucial for polyp counting, and the proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-INR, a novel neural network framework, addresses limitations of existing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) by handling multivariate data on unstructured grids using meta-learning, clustering, and dynamic re-clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INRs struggle with complex structures, single-variable focus, and structured grid dependency, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: MC-INR combines meta-learning and clustering, introduces dynamic re-clustering based on local error, and uses branched layers for multivariate data.

Result: MC-INR outperforms existing methods in scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: MC-INR effectively overcomes INR limitations, offering improved performance for complex real-world datasets.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large public datasets for low-light RGB pedestrian detection, crucial for pedestrian safety in autonomous vehicles.

Method: 1) Infrared detection using a fine-tuned model, 2) Label transfer to RGB, 3) Training object detection models with generated labels.

Result: Models trained on generated labels outperformed ground-truth labels in 6/9 cases for mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively improves low-light RGB pedestrian detection, demonstrating the value of automated labeling.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Motivation: Addressing crop losses in India by improving early disease detection across diverse crops.

Result: Achieved 99% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods covering fewer crops and diseases.

Conclusion: The solution enhances disease detection for Indian farmers, improving yield and food security.

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse
agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images
of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Motivation: To optimize genetic selection in aquaculture by automating and improving the accuracy of shrimp morphological analysis, addressing challenges like view classification and rostrum detection.

Method: Uses modified ResNet-50 for view classification and rostrum detection, VitPose for pose estimation (23 key points), and SVM for pixel-to-centimeter conversion.

Result: Reduces human error in view classification to 0% and rostrum detection to 3.64%, achieves 97.94% mAP for pose estimation, and 0.07 cm conversion error.

Conclusion: IMASHRIMP effectively automates shrimp morphological analysis, enhancing genetic selection efficiency and sustainability in aquaculture.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGe-2 is an advanced model for metric-scale 3D point map recovery from a single image, improving upon MoGe by maintaining relative geometry accuracy while adding metric scale prediction and fine-grained detail enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend monocular geometry estimation to metric scale without losing the affine-invariant accuracy of MoGe, and to address noise and errors in real data that degrade fine-grained detail.

Method: Extends MoGe with strategies for metric geometry prediction and introduces a unified data refinement approach using synthetic labels to filter and complete real data.

Result: Superior performance in accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: MoGe-2 successfully achieves simultaneous capabilities in metric scale, relative geometry accuracy, and fine-grained detail recovery, setting a new benchmark in open-domain geometry estimation.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

*Buzhen Huang, Chen Li, Chongyang Xu, Dongyue Lu, Jinnan Chen, Yangang Wang, Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch optimization framework is proposed to reconstruct accurate human interactions in videos by leveraging human appearance cues, proxemics, and physical laws, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods struggle with visual ambiguities and occlusions in close human interactions, even with advanced models like SAM. Human appearance is identified as a key cue to address these challenges.

Method: A diffusion model learns proxemic behavior and pose priors. These, along with optimizable tensors, are integrated into a dual-branch framework for motion and appearance reconstruction, supported by 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetration constraints.

Result: The method achieves accurate interaction estimation in complex environments, validated by benchmarks. A dataset with pseudo ground-truth annotations is also introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses close human interaction challenges, offering improved performance and a valuable dataset for future research.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

*Alina F. Dima, Suprosanna Shit, Huaqi Qiu, Robbie Holland, Tamara T. Mueller, Fabio Antonio Musio, Kaiyuan Yang, Bjoern Menze, Rickmer Braren, Marcus Makowski, Daniel Rueckert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework integrates voxel, mesh, and parametric representations of vessels using differentiable transformations, enabling automatic shape parameter learning from segmentations without ground-truth shape data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vessel representations (voxel, mesh, parametric) are typically disjoint; the goal is to unify them for seamless, high-fidelity modeling.

Method: Differentiable voxelization extracts parametric shape models (centerlines, radii via B-splines) from segmentations, with meshes derived differentiably from shape parameters.

Result: Accurate geometry capture for complex vessels (aortas, aneurysms, brain vessels) with high-fidelity, manipulable meshes.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies vessel representations, enabling versatile and accurate modeling without reliance on ground-truth shape parameters.

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $S^2DC$, a self-supervised learning framework for 3D medical images, focusing on structure-aware representations by addressing semantic discrepancy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mSSL methods use fixed-size patches, ignoring anatomical structure variations, which are crucial for meaningful distinctions in medical analysis.

Method: $S^2DC$ enforces semantic discrepancy via optimal transport and ensures semantic consistency using neighborhood similarity distribution, bridging patch-level and structure-level representations.

Result: Evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, $S^2DC$ outperforms state-of-the-art mSSL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures structure-aware representations, enhancing performance in medical image analysis.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

TL;DR: AuroraLong replaces transformer-based LLMs with linear RNNs for efficient long video understanding, achieving comparable performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational complexity and memory cost of transformer-based LLMs for long video understanding.

Method: Proposes AuroraLong, using a linear RNN language model with constant-size hidden states and visual token merge for efficiency.

Result: AuroraLong matches performance of similar-sized transformer models on video benchmarks, despite fewer parameters and public data training.

Conclusion: Linear RNNs can democratize long video understanding by reducing computational barriers, as demonstrated by AuroraLong.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting sensor faults in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) for space missions by creating a synthetic dataset of fault-injected images to train AI-based fault detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor faults in VBN can compromise mission reliability, but AI solutions lack representative faulty datasets. This study aims to fill that gap.

Method: Analyzes fault cases in camera sensors, introduces a simulation framework to generate synthetic faulty images, and creates a dataset for AI training.

Result: A dataset of fault-injected images is produced, enabling systematic testing and training of AI fault detection methods.

Conclusion: The synthetic dataset supports AI adoption in VBN fault detection, enhancing reliability for space missions.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Motivation: Addressing the misuse of AI-generated images in misinformation by improving detection techniques with human-verifiable explanations and better generalization.

Method: Developed Holmes-Set dataset (Holmes-SFTSet and Holmes-DPOSet) and Holmes Pipeline, a three-stage training framework for MLLMs, using Multi-Expert Jury for data annotation.

Result: AIGI-Holmes model shows effectiveness in detecting AIGI with human-aligned explanations, validated on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset enhance AIGI detection with human-verifiable explanations and improved generalization.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a diffusion model (DM) image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between flexible zero-shot Plug-and-Play methods and specialized conditional DMs, which trade flexibility for accuracy and speed.

Method: Deep unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (LATINO Langevin sampler) combined with model distillation.

Result: Achieves excellent accuracy and computational efficiency while retaining flexibility to adapt to forward model variations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates deep unfolding and distillation, offering a versatile and efficient solution for posterior sampling in computational imaging.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

TL;DR: APT is a framework to personalize diffusion models with limited data, addressing overfitting and preserving prior knowledge through adaptive training, representation stabilization, and attention alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degraded text alignment arise when personalizing diffusion models with limited data.

Method: APT uses adaptive training adjustments, representation stabilization, and attention alignment to mitigate overfitting and preserve semantic coherence.

Result: APT outperforms existing methods, generating high-quality, diverse images while maintaining prior knowledge.

Conclusion: APT effectively addresses key challenges in personalizing diffusion models with limited data.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Method: CanonSwap decouples motion and appearance, modifies identity in a canonical space, and reintegrates features. It includes a Partial Identity Modulation module for precise transfer.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity preservation.

Conclusion: CanonSwap effectively addresses the coupling of facial appearance and motion, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

*Qi Xu, Dongxu Wei, Lingzhe Zhao, Wenpu Li, Zhangchi Huang, Shunping Ji, Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIU3R is an alignment-free framework for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding from unposed images, achieving state-of-the-art performance by unifying tasks via pixel-aligned 3D representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D-to-3D feature alignment methods limit 3D understanding and lose semantic information, prompting the need for an alignment-free solution.

Method: SIU3R uses pixel-aligned 3D representation and unified learnable queries to avoid 2D alignment, with lightweight modules for task collaboration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in 3D reconstruction, understanding, and their simultaneous execution.

Conclusion: SIU3R's alignment-free approach and mutual benefit designs effectively advance simultaneous 3D tasks.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

*Qin Guo, Ailing Zeng, Dongxu Yue, Ceyuan Yang, Yang Cao, Hanzhong Guo, Fei Shen, Wei Liu, Xihui Liu, Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DiT-based framework, UniMC, is proposed for unifying controllable multi-class image generation, addressing challenges in keypoint-guided models for non-rigid objects. A dataset, HAIG-2.9M, is introduced to support this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keypoint-guided models struggle with non-rigid objects and overlapping instances due to method limitations and lack of suitable datasets.

Method: UniMC integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens. HAIG-2.9M provides a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations.

Result: UniMC effectively handles heavy occlusions and multi-class scenarios, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset advance keypoint-guided generation for diverse objects.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairHuman improves human image generation by balancing global and local objectives using multi-objective fine-tuning and MPD criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating human images with plausible details like faces or hands is challenging due to insufficient local supervision during training.

Method: Proposes FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning approach with global and local objectives (for hands and faces) and optimizes using the MPD criterion.

Result: Significant improvements in generating challenging local details while maintaining overall quality, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FairHuman effectively enhances human image generation by addressing local detail challenges with fairness-aware optimization.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

*M√©lanie Gaillochet, Mehrdad Noori, Sahar Dastani, Christian Desrosiers, Herv√© Lombaert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combines foundation models with weak supervision (bounding boxes) for medical segmentation, outperforming fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on costly pixel-wise annotations in medical imaging by leveraging easier-to-acquire bounding box annotations.

Method: Automates prompt generation for foundation models using bounding boxes, integrating constraints and pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves 84.90% average Dice score in limited data settings, surpassing fully and weakly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between annotation efficiency and segmentation performance.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DexVLG is a vision-language-grasp model for dexterous hands, trained on a large dataset (DexGraspNet 3.0) to predict grasp poses aligned with language instructions, achieving strong zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on functional grasping with large models for dexterous hands due to data collection challenges. DexVLG aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The model uses a large-scale dataset (170 million grasp poses) generated in simulation, paired with captions, to train a vision-language model (VLM) and flow-matching-based pose head.

Result: DexVLG achieves 76% zero-shot execution success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation, with successful real-world performance.

Conclusion: DexVLG demonstrates robust generalization and part-aligned grasping, advancing dexterous manipulation with large models.

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANO introduces a linear-complexity Transformer variant for high-resolution inputs, inspired by n-body simulations, achieving competitive performance with reduced runtime and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have quadratic complexity, making them impractical for high-resolution inputs. Existing solutions often lose fine details.

Method: MANO casts attention as an interaction problem between grid points, using distance-based multiscale computation for linear complexity.

Result: MANO matches ViT and Swin Transformer performance in tasks like image classification and Darcy flows, with significantly lower runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: MANO offers a scalable, efficient alternative to standard Transformers, maintaining performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

TL;DR: Proposes a Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework to reduce annotation costs, outperforming weakly supervised methods and matching semi-supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for oriented object detection datasets drive the need for cost-effective solutions.

Method: Introduces PWOOD framework, OS-Student model, and CPF strategy to leverage weak annotations efficiently.

Result: PWOOD performs comparably or better than semi-supervised methods on DOTA and DIOR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a low-cost, high-performance alternative for oriented object detection.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

*Danrong Zhang, Huili Huang, N. Simrill Smith, Nimisha Roy, J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic segmentation approach for assessing earthquake damage severity in social media images, improving objectivity and precision over traditional classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage severity assessments in post-earthquake social media images are subjective and lack granularity. This study aims to provide a more objective and nuanced analysis.

Method: The study constructs a segmented damage severity dataset (undamaged, damaged, debris) and fine-tunes a SegFormer model for semantic segmentation. A new scoring system quantifies damage severity, adjusted for depth.

Result: The approach enables objective and comprehensive damage severity quantification in social media images, enhancing disaster reconnaissance.

Conclusion: The method improves precision in damage assessment, aiding targeted disaster response efforts.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flexible feature injection framework for text-to-image diffusion models improves structural alignment and visual quality without training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature injection methods for conditional image generation suffer from structural misalignment and artifacts, especially with non-RGB conditions.

Method: Proposes a decoupled feature injection framework with a structure-rich module, appearance-rich prompting, and restart refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conditioning scenarios with better structural and appearance control.

Conclusion: The framework enables training-free, high-quality generation with improved alignment and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes USAD, a multi-attention interaction-based approach for human activity recognition, addressing data scarcity, feature extraction, and device performance with unsupervised data augmentation and spatio-temporal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in HAR include scarce labeled data for rare activities, poor high-level feature extraction, and suboptimal performance on lightweight devices.

Method: Uses unsupervised data augmentation, a multi-branch spatio-temporal network with attention mechanisms, and adaptive multi-loss fusion.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% on WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: USAD effectively addresses HAR challenges and is feasible for deployment on embedded devices.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for object segmentation using reference images and semantic priors from foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the manual effort in generating prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by leveraging reference images and semantic priors.

Method: A multi-stage, training-free approach involving memory bank construction, representation aggregation, and semantic-aware feature matching.

Result: Significant improvements in segmentation metrics, outperforming existing methods on COCO FSOD, PASCAL VOC Few-Shot, and Cross-Domain FSOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates segmentation using reference images and semantic priors, setting new benchmarks in few-shot and cross-domain segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with nonlinear deformations and fine details in animatable avatars from monocular videos.

Method: Introduces HyperGaussians, high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians with a learnable local embedding, and an 'inverse covariance trick' for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms 3DGS in rendering high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, and specular reflections.

Conclusion: HyperGaussians enhance expressivity and quality for animatable face avatars, seamlessly integrating into existing models.

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic, interactive 3D replicas of indoor environments for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and robotics, addressing the need for compact, editable, and high-quality reconstructions.

Method: LiteReality uses scene understanding, a structured scene graph, 3D model retrieval, material painting, and physics integration to reconstruct scenes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on Scan2CAD and robust material transfer, producing compact, editable, and interactive scenes.

Conclusion: LiteReality effectively bridges the gap between raw scans and usable 3D replicas, offering broad applicability in graphics and simulation.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on dense-view reconstruction, leading to artifacts with limited views. LangScene-X aims to overcome this by unifying multi-modality information.

Method: Uses a TriMap video diffusion model for RGB, normals, and segmentation maps, and LQC for language embedding. Aligns language onto 3D scenes.

Conclusion: LangScene-X effectively generalizes 3D language-embedded scenes from sparse views, enabling open-vocabulary queries.

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D

this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

### [137] [Point3R: Streaming 3D Reconstruction with Explicit Spatial Pointer Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02863)
*Yuqi Wu, Wenzhao Zheng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point3R introduces an online framework for dense 3D scene reconstruction using explicit spatial pointer memory to avoid information loss in earlier frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DUSt3R use implicit memory, which has limited capacity and risks losing earlier frame data. Point3R addresses this by maintaining explicit spatial pointers.

Method: Point3R uses explicit spatial pointer memory linked to 3D scene structure, with hierarchical position embedding and a fusion mechanism for efficient integration of new observations.

Result: The method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

Conclusion: Point3R offers an effective solution for dense 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit memory and efficient fusion, outperforming implicit memory approaches.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

*Panpan Ji, Junni Song, Hang Xiao, Hanyu Liu, Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DCDP-HAR, a framework for multimodal HAR with dual-path feature extraction, contrastive learning, and dynamic gradient modulation to address cross-modal alignment and imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multimodal HAR, such as cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions.

Method: Uses ResNet and DenseNet branches for feature extraction, multi-stage contrastive learning, and confidence-driven gradient modulation.

Result: Validated on four public datasets; components proven effective via ablation studies.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR effectively tackles HAR challenges with its novel framework.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

*Ziye Li, Hao Luo, Xincheng Shuai, Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyI2V is a training-free framework for animating conditional images with user-defined motion, supporting diverse modalities and flexible editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V and I2V methods lack precise spatial and motion control, and are limited by text prompts or real images.

Method: Proposes AnyI2V, a training-free framework using user-defined motion trajectories and supporting mixed conditional inputs.

Result: Achieves superior performance in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation, with flexible editing capabilities.

Conclusion: AnyI2V offers a versatile and efficient solution for video generation with enhanced control and editability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

### [140] [Bootstrapping Grounded Chain-of-Thought in Multimodal LLMs for Data-Efficient Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02859)
*Jiaer Xia, Bingkui Tong, Yuhang Zang, Rui Shao, Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training MLLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data improves adaptation to specialized vision tasks, but CoT data often contains factual errors. The proposed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) method injects grounding info (e.g., bounding boxes) to enhance reasoning faithfulness, showing significant improvements in data-limited regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with specialized vision tasks due to dataset mismatches. CoT data helps but introduces factual errors, necessitating a more grounded approach.

Method: Propose GCoT, a bootstrapping-based method to inject grounding info (bounding boxes) into CoT data, improving reasoning faithfulness.

Result: Evaluated on five specialized vision tasks (charts, tables, receipts, reports), GCoT outperforms fine-tuning and distillation in data-limited settings.

Conclusion: GCoT effectively addresses CoT data errors by grounding reasoning steps, enhancing MLLM performance in specialized vision tasks under limited data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EasyCache is a training-free framework that accelerates video diffusion models by reusing computed transformation vectors, reducing inference time by 2.1-3.3√ó while improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational costs of video generation models limit their adoption. EasyCache aims to address this bottleneck.

Method: Introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism to avoid redundant computations during inference, requiring no offline profiling or tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 2.1-3.3√ó faster inference and 36% PSNR improvement over prior methods, tested on models like OpenSora and Wan2.1.

Conclusion: EasyCache is an efficient, accessible solution for high-quality video generation, suitable for research and practical use.

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

*Xiang Fan, Xiaohang Sun, Kushan Thakkar, Zhu Liu, Vimal Bhat, Ranjay Krishna, Xiang Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTok, a reference-based tokenization method, improves video model performance by capturing temporal dynamics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video models struggle with temporal redundancy and dependencies, treating frames independently. RefTok addresses this by leveraging reference frames for better context and motion continuity.

Method: RefTok encodes and decodes frames using an unquantized reference frame, preserving motion and appearance details like facial features, text, and patterns.

Result: RefTok outperforms Cosmos and MAGVIT by 36.7% on metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and improves video generation by 27.9% over MAGVIT-L.

Conclusion: RefTok effectively handles temporal redundancy, enhancing video modeling and generation with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

*Heeseung Kwon, Francisco M. Castro, Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez, Nicolas Guil, Karteek Alahari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiSA, a lightweight attention operator with log-linear complexity, addressing redundancy and computational inefficiency in traditional attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional attention operators suffer from high redundancy and quadratic complexity, limiting their efficiency and discriminative power.

Method: LiSA enhances attention kernels by learning structural patterns via relative position embeddings (RPEs) and approximates RPEs for log-linear complexity.

Result: LiSA outperforms self-attention and other operators, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K, Kinetics-400, COCO, and ADE-20K.

Conclusion: LiSA offers a more efficient and powerful attention mechanism, validated by superior performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual
understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable
kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the
attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy,
and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence
length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called
Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation
power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels
to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural
patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs)
as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the
attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear
complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator
outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving
state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as
video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance
segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.

*Yueming Lyu, Tianwei Lin, Fu Li, Dongliang He, Jing Dong, Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeltaEdit is a framework for text-driven image manipulation without needing annotated data or per-prompt optimization. It leverages CLIP's delta space for training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on expensive annotated data or require per-prompt optimization, limiting flexibility. DeltaEdit aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: DeltaEdit maps CLIP visual feature differences to StyleGAN editing directions during training and uses CLIP textual feature differences for inference.

Result: The framework enables zero-shot inference with various text prompts without additional tuning.

Conclusion: DeltaEdit provides a flexible and efficient solution for text-driven image manipulation.

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation remains challenging in training or inference
flexibility. Conditional generative models depend heavily on expensive
annotated training data. Meanwhile, recent frameworks, which leverage
pre-trained vision-language models, are limited by either per text-prompt
optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. In this work, we
propose a novel framework named \textit{DeltaEdit} to address these problems.
Our key idea is to investigate and identify a space, namely delta image and
text space that has well-aligned distribution between CLIP visual feature
differences of two images and CLIP textual embedding differences of source and
target texts. Based on the CLIP delta space, the DeltaEdit network is designed
to map the CLIP visual features differences to the editing directions of
StyleGAN at training phase. Then, in inference phase, DeltaEdit predicts the
StyleGAN's editing directions from the differences of the CLIP textual
features. In this way, DeltaEdit is trained in a text-free manner. Once
trained, it can well generalize to various text prompts for zero-shot inference
without bells and whistles.

TL;DR: A novel trust measure for XAI systems is introduced, combining performance metrics and trust indicators, validated through case studies showing improvements over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency in Deep Learning models has led to the need for XAI methods to enhance user trust in automated systems.

Method: Proposes a new trust metric integrating performance and trust indicators, validated via three case studies.

Result: The method shows improved sensitivity to scenarios and outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The novel trust measure effectively refines XAI systems, enhancing their reliability and user trust.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on Deep Learning models, combined with their inherent
lack of transparency, has spurred the development of a novel field of study
known as eXplainable AI (XAI) methods. These methods seek to enhance the trust
of end-users in automated systems by providing insights into the rationale
behind their decisions. This paper presents a novel trust measure in XAI
systems, allowing their refinement. Our proposed metric combines both
performance metrics and trust indicators from an objective perspective. To

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TiCoSS, a joint learning framework for semantic segmentation and stereo matching, featuring gated feature fusion, hierarchical deep supervision, and a coupling tightening loss function, achieving a 9% mIoU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance autonomous driving perception by tightly coupling semantic segmentation and stereo matching, leveraging shared features for improved performance.

Method: The method includes a gated feature fusion strategy, hierarchical deep supervision, and a coupling tightening loss function within the TiCoSS framework.

Result: Results show superior performance on KITTI and vKITTI2 datasets, with a 9% increase in mIoU compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that tightly coupling semantic segmentation and stereo matching significantly improves performance, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation and stereo matching, respectively analogous to the
ventral and dorsal streams in our human brain, are two key components of
autonomous driving perception systems. Addressing these two tasks with separate
networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision
algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and
embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them
within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing
between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in
comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and
stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a
tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep
supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined
use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art
joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and
stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2
datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the
effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate
its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in
mIoU by over 9%. Our source code will be publicly available at

*Zitian Wang, Zehao Huang, Yulu Gao, Naiyan Wang, Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV2DFusion is a multi-modal 3D object detection framework combining camera and LiDAR data via query-based fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles require robust 3D object detection, but single-modality systems (cameras or LiDAR alone) have limitations.

Method: MV2DFusion uses image and point cloud query generators to align modality-specific attributes, enabling sparse fusion for efficient detection.

Result: Outperforms on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, excelling in long-range detection.

Conclusion: MV2DFusion's flexibility and performance highlight its potential for future autonomous vehicle applications.

Abstract: The rise of autonomous vehicles has significantly increased the demand for
robust 3D object detection systems. While cameras and LiDAR sensors each offer
unique advantages--cameras provide rich texture information and LiDAR offers
precise 3D spatial data--relying on a single modality often leads to
performance limitations. This paper introduces MV2DFusion, a multi-modal
detection framework that integrates the strengths of both worlds through an
advanced query-based fusion mechanism. By introducing an image query generator
to align with image-specific attributes and a point cloud query generator,
MV2DFusion effectively combines modality-specific object semantics without
biasing toward one single modality. Then the sparse fusion process can be
accomplished based on the valuable object semantics, ensuring efficient and
accurate object detection across various scenarios. Our framework's flexibility
allows it to integrate with any image and point cloud-based detectors,
showcasing its adaptability and potential for future advancements. Extensive
evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that MV2DFusion
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-range
detection scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel probe movement guidance algorithm is introduced to assist in echocardiography by learning personalized cardiac structures through a sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method, reducing probe guidance errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the shortage of trained professionals and the complexity of echocardiography by improving probe guidance for high-quality image acquisition.

Method: Sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training to learn personalized 3D cardiac features by predicting masked-out image features and probe movements in scanning sequences.

Result: The method reduces probe guidance errors significantly, outperforming advanced baselines on a dataset of 1.31 million samples.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves echocardiography guidance by capturing personalized cardiac structures, with potential applications in robotics and novice training.

Abstract: Echocardiography is an essential medical technique for diagnosing
cardiovascular diseases, but its high operational complexity has led to a
shortage of trained professionals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
probe movement guidance algorithm that has the potential to be applied in
guiding robotic systems or novices with probe pose adjustment for high-quality
standard plane image acquisition.Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges:
(1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant
individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged
structure of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structures, leading to
a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observe that sonographers dynamically
adjust their interpretation of a patient's cardiac anatomy based on prior
scanning sequences, consequently refining their scanning strategies. Inspired
by this, we propose a novel sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method.
Specifically, our approach learns personalized three-dimensional cardiac
structural features by predicting the masked-out image features and probe
movement actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can
predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of
personalized cardiac structure. Extensive experiments on a large-scale expert
scanning dataset with 1.31 million samples demonstrate that our proposed
sequence-aware paradigm can effectively reduce probe guidance errors compared
to other advanced baseline methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper explores robotic laptop refurbishing, focusing on sticker detection and removal. It uses Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification and evaluates six models with three datasets, providing guidelines for model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend laptop lifespans and reduce e-waste, the study addresses the challenge of uncertain sticker identification in automated refurbishing processes.

Method: Adopted Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification, evaluated six sticker detection models using three datasets (original, DALL-E-3, Stable Diffusion-3), and introduced robustness metrics.

Result: Different models performed variably across metrics, leading to guidelines for selecting the most robust sticker detection models.

Conclusion: The study offers practical insights for improving automated laptop refurbishing, emphasizing uncertainty-aware model selection.

Abstract: Refurbishing laptops extends their lives while contributing to reducing
electronic waste, which promotes building a sustainable future. To this end,
the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) focuses on the research and
development of several robotic applications empowered with software, including
laptop refurbishing. Cleaning represents a major step in refurbishing and
involves identifying and removing stickers from laptop surfaces. Software plays
a crucial role in the cleaning process. For instance, the software integrates
various object detection models to identify and remove stickers from laptops
automatically. However, given the diversity in types of stickers (e.g., shapes,
colors, locations), identification of the stickers is highly uncertain, thereby
requiring explicit quantification of uncertainty associated with the identified
stickers. Such uncertainty quantification can help reduce risks in removing
stickers, which, for example, could otherwise result in software faults
damaging laptop surfaces. For uncertainty quantification, we adopted the Monte
Carlo Dropout method to evaluate six sticker detection models (SDMs) from DTI
using three datasets: the original image dataset from DTI and two datasets
generated with vision language models, i.e., DALL-E-3 and Stable Diffusion-3.
In addition, we presented novel robustness metrics concerning detection
accuracy and uncertainty to assess the robustness of the SDMs based on
adversarial datasets generated from the three datasets using a dense adversary
method.
  Our evaluation results show that different SDMs perform differently regarding
different metrics. Based on the results, we provide SDM selection guidelines
and lessons learned from various perspectives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLaVA-KD, a framework to transfer knowledge from large-scale Multimodal Large Language Models (l-MLLMs) to small-scale ones (s-MLLMs) using Multimodal Distillation and Relation Distillation, improving performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale MLLMs are computationally expensive, while small-scale ones suffer performance drops. The goal is to enhance s-MLLMs by leveraging knowledge from l-MLLMs.

Method: Proposes LLaVA-KD with Multimodal Distillation (MDist) and Relation Distillation (RDist), along with a three-stage training scheme: Distilled Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning, and Distilled Fine-Tuning.

Result: Significantly improves s-MLLMs' performance, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: LLaVA-KD effectively transfers knowledge from l-MLLMs to s-MLLMs, enhancing their capabilities without altering their architecture.

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired the development of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for unified understanding of vision
and language. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity
of large-scale MLLMs (l-MLLMs) limit their use in resource-constrained
scenarios. Although small-scale MLLMs (s-MLLMs) are designed to reduce
computational costs, they typically suffer from performance degradation. To
mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer
knowledge from l-MLLMs to s-MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal
Distillation (MDist) to transfer teacher model's robust representations across
both visual and linguistic modalities, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to
transfer teacher model's ability to capture visual token relationships.
Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the
potential of the proposed distillation strategy: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to
strengthen the alignment between visual-linguistic representations in s-MLLMs,
2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the s-MLLMs with multimodal understanding
capacity, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to refine s-MLLM's knowledge. Our
approach significantly improves s-MLLMs performance without altering the model
architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component. Code will be available at

Method: The SURE-VQA framework proposes three requirements: evaluating on real-world shifts, using LLMs for semantic evaluation, and reporting meaningful baselines. A study on Fine-Tuning methods across medical datasets validates the framework.

Result: Findings show no FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than shifts. LoRA is the best-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

Conclusion: SURE-VQA provides a systematic way to evaluate VLM robustness, revealing critical insights for safe deployment in medical VQA.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like
Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants
for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts
on unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such
robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic
insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups
fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key
requirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM
robustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily
translate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that
are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail
to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models
(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks
interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines
should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To
demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the
robustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets
with four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into
robustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and
2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution
shifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the
image data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the
best-performing FT method on in-distribution data. Code is provided at

*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux, Michael Soumm, Adrian Popescu, Bertrand Luvison, Herv√© Le Borgne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new controlled generation pipeline improves fairness in face recognition/verification, outperforming other bias mitigation methods while slightly boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical, legal, and technical challenges in face recognition due to sensitive data and biases in training datasets.

Method: Introduces a controlled generation pipeline using the DCFace framework, evaluated with fairness metrics and statistical analysis (logit models, ANOVA).

Result: The pipeline enhances fairness more than other approaches and slightly improves raw performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates bias in face recognition while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Face recognition and verification are two computer vision tasks whose
performances have advanced with the introduction of deep representations.
However, ethical, legal, and technical challenges due to the sensitive nature
of face data and biases in real-world training datasets hinder their
development. Generative AI addresses privacy by creating fictitious identities,
but fairness problems remain. Using the existing DCFace SOTA framework, we
introduce a new controlled generation pipeline that improves fairness. Through
classical fairness metrics and a proposed in-depth statistical analysis based
on logit models and ANOVA, we show that our generation pipeline improves
fairness more than other bias mitigation approaches while slightly improving
raw performance.

### [153] [Self-Guidance: Boosting Flow and Diffusion Generation on Their Own](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05827)
*Tiancheng Li, Weijian Luo, Zhiyang Chen, Liyuan Ma, Guo-Jun Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-Guidance (SG) improves image quality in diffusion models by detecting and suppressing low-quality samples without retraining, offering plug-and-play flexibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods require specific training or strong biases, limiting their applications. SG leverages sampling probabilities at different noise levels to detect and suppress artifacts.

Method: SG uses the model's sampling probabilities at varying noise levels to identify and suppress low-quality samples. SG-prev, an efficient variant, reuses previous step outputs to avoid extra computation.

Result: SG outperforms existing methods on metrics like FID and Human Preference Score. It also improves human body structure generation (e.g., hands, faces). SG-prev achieves similar results with one forward pass.

Conclusion: SG and SG-prev enhance diffusion model outputs without retraining, offering flexibility and efficiency while improving image quality and reducing artifacts.

Abstract: Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation
results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models.
Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases
of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated
by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant
decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose
Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the
generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities
of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any
guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a
plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more
efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the
immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct
experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different
architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced
diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing
algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score.
SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with
only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a
surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human
body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of
eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code
along with this paper.

*Xin Dong, Sen Jia, Ming Rui Wang, Yan Li, Zhenheng Yang, Bingfeng Deng, Hongyu Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COEF-VQ is a cascaded MLLM framework for video quality understanding, optimizing GPU usage by pre-filtering low-uncertainty cases while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high GPU resource demands of deploying MLLMs online for video classification tasks.

Method: Integrates entropy-based pre-filtering with a lightweight model to selectively pass high-uncertainty cases to the MLLM.

Result: Reduces GPU usage significantly, improves video quality classification, and lowers inappropriate content view rate by 9.9%.

Conclusion: COEF-VQ effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, enhancing platform safety with minimal resource impact.

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
technology, it has become possible to exploit its video understanding
capability on different classification tasks. In practice, we face the
difficulty of huge requirements for GPU resource if we need to deploy MLLMs
online. In this paper, we propose COEF-VQ, a novel cascaded MLLM framework
designed to enhance video quality understanding on the short-video platform
while optimizing computational efficiency. Our approach integrates an
entropy-based pre-filtering stage, where a lightweight model assesses
uncertainty and selectively filters cases before passing them to the more
computationally intensive MLLM for final evaluation. By prioritizing
high-uncertainty samples for deeper analysis, our framework significantly
reduces GPU usage while maintaining the strong classification performance of a
full MLLM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COEF-VQ, we deploy
this new framework onto the video management platform (VMP) at the short-video
platform, and perform a series of detailed experiments on two in-house tasks
related to video quality understanding. We show that COEF-VQ leads to
substantial performance gains from the offline evaluation in these two tasks
and effectively enhances platform safety with limit resource consumption,
significantly reducing inappropriate content video view rate by 9.9% in a
online A/B test without affecting engagement. Post-launch monitoring confirmed
sustained improvements, validating its real-world impact.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel lightweight CL framework, AESP, combines prompt tuning and adapters to mitigate catastrophic forgetting with low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning without high memory costs.

Method: Integrates semantic-guided prompts and adapters, with a matching mechanism for prompt selection.

Result: Achieves strong performance on three CL datasets.

Conclusion: AESP shows promise for advancing continual learning efficiently.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to evolving data streams. A
major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge will
overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods usually retain the
past data for replay or add additional branches in the model to learn new
knowledge, which has high memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a
novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP),
which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design
semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual
features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information,
aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task.
Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have
developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection. Extensive
experiments on three CL datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
favorable performance across multiple metrics, showing its potential for
advancing CL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs show subhuman but competitive visual-spatial intelligence on VSI-Bench, with spatial reasoning as the bottleneck. Cognitive maps improve performance, unlike linguistic reasoning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess if MLLMs can 'think in space' like humans from video data.

Method: Developed VSI-Bench (5,000+ QA pairs) to test MLLMs' visual-spatial intelligence, probing linguistic and visual spatial reasoning.

Result: MLLMs exhibit emerging spatial awareness but lag behind humans. Cognitive maps enhance spatial distance ability.

Conclusion: Spatial reasoning is key for MLLMs; cognitive maps outperform traditional linguistic reasoning methods.

Abstract: Humans possess the visual-spatial intelligence to remember spaces from
sequential visual observations. However, can Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) trained on million-scale video datasets also ``think in space'' from
videos? We present a novel video-based visual-spatial intelligence benchmark
(VSI-Bench) of over 5,000 question-answer pairs, and find that MLLMs exhibit
competitive - though subhuman - visual-spatial intelligence. We probe models to
express how they think in space both linguistically and visually and find that
while spatial reasoning capabilities remain the primary bottleneck for MLLMs to
reach higher benchmark performance, local world models and spatial awareness do
emerge within these models. Notably, prevailing linguistic reasoning techniques
(e.g., chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree-of-thoughts) fail to improve
performance, whereas explicitly generating cognitive maps during
question-answering enhances MLLMs' spatial distance ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZeroStereo is a novel pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching, synthesizing high-quality stereo images from single images using pseudo disparities and diffusion inpainting, achieving state-of-the-art generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited annotated real-world stereo data for supervised stereo matching methods.

Method: Leverages monocular depth estimation for pseudo disparities, fine-tunes a diffusion inpainting model for occluded regions, and introduces training-free confidence generation and adaptive disparity selection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across datasets with minimal training data.

Conclusion: ZeroStereo effectively bridges the gap in stereo data scarcity, enabling robust zero-shot stereo matching.

Abstract: State-of-the-art supervised stereo matching methods have achieved remarkable
performance on various benchmarks. However, their generalization to real-world
scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated real-world
stereo data. In this paper, we propose ZeroStereo, a novel stereo image
generation pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching. Our approach synthesizes
high-quality right images from arbitrary single images by leveraging pseudo
disparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model. Unlike previous
methods that address occluded regions by filling missing areas with neighboring
pixels or random backgrounds, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to
recover missing details while preserving semantic structure. Additionally, we
propose Training-Free Confidence Generation, which mitigates the impact of
unreliable pseudo labels without additional training, and Adaptive Disparity
Selection, which ensures a diverse and realistic disparity distribution while
preventing excessive occlusion and foreground distortion. Experiments
demonstrate that models trained with our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art
zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets with only a dataset volume
comparable to Scene Flow. Code: https://github.com/Windsrain/ZeroStereo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images improves fetal plane classification accuracy when combined with real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images restricts machine learning model training.

Method: Train classifiers on synthetic images first, then fine-tune with real images.

Result: Incorporating synthetic images improves classification accuracy over using real images alone.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can effectively address data scarcity in ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in medical diagnosis, especially for fetal
health assessment. However, the availability of high-quality annotated
ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning
models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate
synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane
classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and
then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads
to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The
findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a
valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound
medical imaging.

TL;DR: CAD-Editor is the first framework for text-based CAD editing, using automated data synthesis and a locate-then-infill approach with LLMs for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based CAD editing is underexplored, with existing methods lacking support for text-based control or ignoring existing CAD constraints.

Method: Proposes CAD-Editor, using automated data synthesis for training and a locate-then-infill framework with LLMs.

Result: CAD-Editor achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses text-based CAD editing challenges, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Computer Aided Design (CAD) is indispensable across various industries.
\emph{Text-based CAD editing}, which automates the modification of CAD models
based on textual instructions, holds great potential but remains underexplored.
Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based
CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting
existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first
framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding
triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated
data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to
generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing
instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we
propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two
focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these
regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the
backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language
understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves
superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is

*Mike Ranzinger, Greg Heinrich, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Bryan Catanzaro, Andrew Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for upsampling feature maps of low-resolution vision encoders to retain fine-grained details, tested on perception tasks and model distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision backbones like ViTs and CLIP are limited by inflexible low resolutions, losing fine details.

Method: Introduces a coherent and cost-effective upsampling technique for feature maps.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in core perception tasks and model distillation using RADIO.

Conclusion: The method enhances feature maps for better performance in AI tasks.

Abstract: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI
tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation,
object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in
vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of
general purpose vision backbones is Vision Transformers (ViT), typically
trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most
off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low
resolution. Most run at $224 \times 224$px, while the "high-resolution"
versions are around $378-448$px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel
method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-resolution
vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise
be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on
core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model training using
RADIO as a way of providing richer targets for distillation. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 12 CNN architectures in a transformer-based encoder for remote sensing image captioning, finding that encoder choice significantly impacts caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The encoder's role in remote sensing image captioning is understudied despite its impact on feature extraction and caption quality.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 12 CNN architectures in a transformer-based encoder, followed by numerical and human evaluation.

Result: Specific CNN architectures enhance caption quality, with encoder selection being crucial for performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for improving transformer-based captioning models by optimizing encoder architectures.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is the process of generating
meaningful descriptions from remote sensing images. Recently, it has gained
significant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for
generating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features
from the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while
the decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual
descriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant
popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and
contextual information. The decoder has been well explored for text generation,
whereas the encoder remains relatively unexplored. However, optimizing the
encoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted
features, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address
this gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to
assess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages:
first, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on
their performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human
evaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally,
we analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and
beam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical
role of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating
that specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated
descriptions for remote sensing images. By providing a detailed comparison of
multiple encoders, this study offers valuable insights to guide advances in
transformer-based image captioning models.

*Jianning Chi, Zelan Li, Geng Lin, MingYang Sun, Xiaosheng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised framework for thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images uses high-confidence pseudo-labels and high-rationality losses to address label noise and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised methods suffer from low-confidence pseudo-labels and rigid loss functions, limiting segmentation accuracy for diverse nodule shapes.

Method: The framework generates high-confidence labels by fusing geometric transformations and MedSAM model results. It employs alignment, contrastive, and prototype correlation losses for multi-level feature learning.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on TN3K and DDTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves segmentation accuracy by addressing label noise and leveraging discriminative features.

Abstract: Weakly supervised segmentation methods can delineate thyroid nodules in
ultrasound images efficiently using training data with coarse labels, but
suffer from: 1) low-confidence pseudo-labels that follow topological priors,
introducing significant label noise, and 2) low-rationality loss functions that
rigidly compare segmentation with labels, ignoring discriminative information
for nodules with diverse and complex shapes. To solve these issues, we clarify
the objective and references for weakly supervised ultrasound image
segmentation, presenting a framework with high-confidence pseudo-labels to
represent topological and anatomical information and high-rationality losses to
capture multi-level discriminative features. Specifically, we fuse geometric
transformations of four-point annotations and MedSAM model results prompted by
specific annotations to generate high-confidence box, foreground, and
background labels. Our high-rationality learning strategy includes: 1)
Alignment loss measuring spatial consistency between segmentation and box
label, and topological continuity within the foreground label, guiding the
network to perceive nodule location; 2) Contrastive loss pulling features from
labeled foreground regions while pushing features from labeled foreground and
background regions, guiding the network to learn nodule and background feature
distribution; 3) Prototype correlation loss measuring consistency between
correlation maps derived by comparing features with foreground and background
prototypes, refining uncertain regions to accurate nodule edges. Experimental
results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TN3K
and DDTI datasets. The code is available at

Result: Achieves real-time generation, adapts to unseen speaking styles, and outperforms existing methods in accuracy and quality.

Conclusion: The model enables realistic, adaptable 3D talking avatars with unique styles, advancing speech-driven animation.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic lip movements

existing diffusion-based methods are capable of producing natural motions,
their slow generation speed limits their application potential. In this paper,
we introduce a novel autoregressive model that achieves real-time generation of
highly synchronized lip movements and realistic head poses and eye blinks by
learning a mapping from speech to a multi-scale motion codebook. Furthermore,
our model can adapt to unseen speaking styles, enabling the creation of 3D
talking avatars with unique personal styles beyond the identities seen during
training. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches in lip synchronization accuracy and perceived
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large, diverse 3D datasets for maize phenotyping limits AI/ML tool development. 2D images miss critical structural details like leaf architecture and plant volume.

Method: Collected 1,045 TLS point clouds, segmented 520 plants using graph-based methods, and fitted procedural models with NURBS surfaces via optimization. Rigorous quality control ensured accuracy.

Result: A high-quality, annotated dataset with metadata, multi-resolution point clouds, and procedural models for maize plants.

Conclusion: MaizeField3D provides a foundational resource for AI-driven phenotyping and 3D agricultural research, addressing the gap in 3D maize datasets.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to
the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture
essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and
spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we
present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated
dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic
panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset
includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a
terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset
were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate
individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples.
This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a
structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the
maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step
optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We
conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in
segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata
annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and
quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k
points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational
tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for
AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in
agricultural research.

TL;DR: Proposes RFWNet, a lightweight RSOD algorithm with multiscale receptive fields and foreground focus, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in RSOD like interclass similarity, imbalanced foreground-background, small object size, and accuracy-complexity tradeoff.

Method: Uses RFASNet for context, FBSM for foreground focus, and LWCW loss for small object sensitivity.

Result: Achieved 95.3% and 73.2% mAP on DOTA V1.0 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets with 6.0M parameters and 52 FPS.

Conclusion: RFWNet efficiently balances accuracy and computational complexity for RSOD.

Abstract: Challenges in remote sensing object detection(RSOD), such as high interclass
similarity, imbalanced foreground-background distribution, and the small size
of objects in remote sensing images, significantly hinder detection accuracy.
Moreover, the tradeoff between model accuracy and computational complexity
poses additional constraints on the application of RSOD algorithms. To address
these issues, this study proposes an efficient and lightweight RSOD algorithm
integrating multiscale receptive fields and foreground focus mechanism, named
robust foreground weighted network(RFWNet). Specifically, we proposed a
lightweight backbone network receptive field adaptive selection network
(RFASNet), leveraging the rich context information of remote sensing images to
enhance class separability. Additionally, we developed a foreground-background
separation module(FBSM)consisting of a background redundant information
filtering module (BRIFM) and a foreground information enhancement module (FIEM)
to emphasize critical regions within images while filtering redundant
background information. Finally, we designed a loss function, the weighted
CIoU-Wasserstein loss (LWCW),which weights the IoU-based loss by using the
normalized Wasserstein distance to mitigate model sensitivity to small object
position deviations. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that
RFWNet achieved 95.3% and 73.2% mean average precision (mAP) with 6.0 M
parameters on the DOTA V1.0 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets, respectively, with an
inference speed of 52 FPS.

*Gangwei Xu, Jiaxin Liu, Xianqi Wang, Junda Cheng, Yong Deng, Jinliang Zang, Yurui Chen, Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel bilateral aggregation network (BANet) for mobile stereo matching uses 2D convolutions to achieve high-quality results with sharp edges and fine details, outperforming other mobile-friendly methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile deployment of stereo matching is challenging due to the computational demands of 3D convolutions and the limitations of 2D convolutions, which cause edge blurring and detail loss.

Method: BANet separates the cost volume into detailed and smooth volumes using spatial attention, performs separate aggregations, and fuses them for the final disparity map.

Result: BANet-2D achieves 35.3% higher accuracy than MobileStereoNet-2D on KITTI 2015 and runs faster on mobile devices.

Conclusion: BANet provides an efficient, high-quality solution for mobile stereo matching using only 2D convolutions.

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching methods typically use costly 3D convolutions
to aggregate a full cost volume, but their computational demands make mobile
deployment challenging. Directly applying 2D convolutions for cost aggregation
often results in edge blurring, detail loss, and mismatches in textureless
regions. Some complex operations, like deformable convolutions and iterative
warping, can partially alleviate this issue; however, they are not
mobile-friendly, limiting their deployment on mobile devices. In this paper, we
present a novel bilateral aggregation network (BANet) for mobile stereo
matching that produces high-quality results with sharp edges and fine details
using only 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first separate the full cost
volume into detailed and smooth volumes using a spatial attention map, then
perform detailed and smooth aggregations accordingly, ultimately fusing both to
obtain the final disparity map. Experimental results demonstrate that our
BANet-2D significantly outperforms other mobile-friendly methods, achieving
35.3\% higher accuracy on the KITTI 2015 leaderboard than MobileStereoNet-2D,
with faster runtime on mobile devices. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues like multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based HAR.

Method: Uses spatiotemporal attention modal decomposition alignment fusion, cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and gradient modulation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively tackles key challenges in HAR.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a fundamental technology for numerous
human - centered intelligent applications. Although deep learning methods have
been utilized to accelerate feature extraction, issues such as multimodal data
mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment remain largely
unresolved. The aim of this paper is to address issues such as multimodal data
mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based
human activity recognition. We propose a spatiotemporal attention modal
decomposition alignment fusion strategy to tackle the problem of the mixed
distribution of sensor data. Key discriminative features of activities are
captured through cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and
gradient modulation is combined to alleviate data heterogeneity. In addition, a
wearable deployment simulation system is constructed. We conducted experiments
on a large number of public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
model.

TL;DR: Stereo Any Video is a framework for video stereo matching that achieves accurate and consistent disparities without auxiliary data, leveraging monocular depth priors and novel architectural innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of achieving spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities in video stereo matching without relying on additional information like camera poses or optical flow.

Method: The framework integrates monocular video depth priors with convolutional features, introducing all-to-all-pairs correlation for robust cost volumes and temporal convex upsampling for coherence.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot settings and generalizes well to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.

Conclusion: Stereo Any Video sets a new standard in video stereo matching by combining rich priors and architectural innovations for robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency.

Abstract: This paper introduces Stereo Any Video, a powerful framework for video stereo
matching. It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent
disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or
optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular
video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce
stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural
innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs
smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which
improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness,
accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo
matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and
quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to
real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.

*Ilkin Sevgi Isler, David Mohaisen, Curtis Lisle, Damla Turgut, Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage, uncertainty-guided framework improves tumor segmentation in thoracic CT by combining coarse localization with refined ROI segmentation and anatomical post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like boundary ambiguity, class imbalance, and anatomical variability in tumor segmentation.

Method: Uses a coarse-to-fine approach: first-stage model for initial prediction, anatomical filtering, and second-stage model with uncertainty-aware loss for refined segmentation.

Result: Improved Dice and Hausdorff scores, fewer false positives, and better spatial interpretability. Dice score on Orlando dataset rose from 0.4690 to 0.6447.

Conclusion: Combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in cascaded pipelines enhances robustness and clinical relevance of tumor delineation.

Abstract: Reliable tumor segmentation in thoracic computed tomography (CT) remains
challenging due to boundary ambiguity, class imbalance, and anatomical
variability. We propose an uncertainty-guided, coarse-to-fine segmentation
framework that combines full-volume tumor localization with refined
region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, enhanced by anatomically aware
post-processing. The first-stage model generates a coarse prediction, followed
by anatomically informed filtering based on lung overlap, proximity to lung
surfaces, and component size. The resulting ROIs are segmented by a
second-stage model trained with uncertainty-aware loss functions to improve
accuracy and boundary calibration in ambiguous regions. Experiments on private
and public datasets demonstrate improvements in Dice and Hausdorff scores, with
fewer false positives and enhanced spatial interpretability. These results
highlight the value of combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in
cascaded segmentation pipelines for robust and clinically meaningful tumor
delineation. On the Orlando dataset, our framework improved Swin UNETR Dice
from 0.4690 to 0.6447. Reduction in spurious components was strongly correlated
with segmentation gains, underscoring the value of anatomically informed
post-processing.

*Weili Zeng, Ziyuan Huang, Kaixiang Ji, Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skip-Vision is a framework to improve efficiency in vision-language models by skipping redundant FFN computations and pruning KV-cache during inference, reducing training time and FLOPs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of Transformer-based MLLMs due to visual tokens motivates the need for efficient training and inference methods.

Method: Introduces Skip-FFN for training (bypassing FFN layers for redundant tokens) and selective KV-cache removal for inference (pruning skipped key-value pairs).

Result: Reduces training time by 35%, inference FLOPs by 75%, and latency by 45%, with comparable or better performance.

Conclusion: Skip-Vision offers a practical solution for scaling efficient and high-performance MLLMs.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically
when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck
stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image
understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both
training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of
conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two
complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe
that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal
feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN
layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a
selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs
during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference
FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior
performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for
scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.

*Alejandra Perez, Han Zhang, Yu-Chun Ku, Lalithkumar Seenivasan, Roger Soberanis, Jose L. Porras, Richard Day, Jeff Jopling, Peter Najjar, Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis using Digital Twins (DT) achieves comparable or better event detection than raw RGB video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing OR workflows is critical, but privacy concerns limit the use of OR videos for automated event detection.

Method: 1. Use vision foundation models to create de-identified DTs from RGB videos. 2. Apply the SafeOR model (two-stream approach) for event detection using segmentation masks and depth maps.

Result: DT-based approach matches or outperforms RGB video models in OR event detection on a dataset of 38 simulated trials.

Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating data sharing and improving model generalizability.

Abstract: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows
is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. While computer vision
approaches for automatic recognition of perioperative events can identify
bottlenecks for OR optimization, privacy concerns limit the use of OR videos
for automated event detection. We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. First, we leverage
vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to
generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB
videos. Second, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that
processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. Evaluation
on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes
shows that our DT-based approach achieves performance on par with -- and
sometimes better than -- raw RGB video-based models for OR event detection.
Digital Twins enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the
sharing of de-identified data across institutions and potentially enhancing
model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

*Bo-Kai Ruan, Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single cross-domain diffusion model is proposed to handle multiple makeup tasks (beauty filter, transfer, removal) using domain embeddings, eliminating the need for separate models. A new dataset (MT-Text) is introduced for text-guided makeup applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing makeup techniques require multiple models for different tasks and lack text-guided functionality, increasing complexity and limiting user-friendliness.

Method: Formulate makeup tasks as cross-domain translations using a diffusion model with domain embeddings for seamless task switching. Introduce the MT-Text dataset for text-to-makeup applications.

Result: The proposed model reduces complexity by unifying tasks into one framework and enables text-guided makeup without reference images.

Conclusion: The study advances makeup technology by simplifying task handling and introducing text-guided capabilities, supported by the new MT-Text dataset.

Abstract: Existing makeup techniques often require designing multiple models to handle
different inputs and align features across domains for different makeup tasks,
e.g., beauty filter, makeup transfer, and makeup removal, leading to increased
complexity. Another limitation is the absence of text-guided makeup try-on,
which is more user-friendly without needing reference images. In this study, we
make the first attempt to use a single model for various makeup tasks.
Specifically, we formulate different makeup tasks as cross-domain translations
and leverage a cross-domain diffusion model to accomplish all tasks. Unlike
existing methods that rely on separate encoder-decoder configurations or
cycle-based mechanisms, we propose using different domain embeddings to
facilitate domain control. This allows for seamless domain switching by merely
changing embeddings with a single model, thereby reducing the reliance on
additional modules for different tasks. Moreover, to support precise
text-to-makeup applications, we introduce the MT-Text dataset by extending the
MT dataset with textual annotations, advancing the practicality of makeup
technologies.

*Siyu Chen, Ting Han, Changshe Zhang, Xin Luo, Meiliu Wu, Guorong Cai, Jinhe Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthForge integrates depth information with Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance geometric consistency and generalization in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual cues are susceptible to variations, while depth information is more stable. Leveraging depth can improve VFM performance in DGSS.

Method: Proposes DepthForge, a framework combining visual cues from frozen VFMs (DINOv2/EVA02) and depth cues from Depth Anything V2. Uses depth-aware learnable tokens and a depth refinement decoder.

Result: Outperforms alternatives in DGSS settings across five datasets, with stronger performance, steadier attention, and superior generalization, especially in extreme conditions.

Conclusion: DepthForge effectively integrates depth and visual features, demonstrating significant improvements in DGSS tasks.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have delivered remarkable performance in
Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). However, recent methods often
overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying
geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this
paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with
features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and
boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning
DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen
DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of
the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple
domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth
awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement
decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine
multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive
experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different
datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches
with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior
generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding
performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow). Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Task-Adapter++ improves few-shot action recognition by addressing issues in fine-tuning, task-specific information, semantic order, and cross-modal alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for few-shot action recognition (FSAR) using pre-trained models like CLIP face challenges in generalization, task-specific exploration, semantic order modeling, and cross-modal alignment.

Method: Proposes Task-Adapter++, a dual adaptation method for image and text encoders, incorporating task-specific adaptation, LLM-generated sub-action descriptions, semantic order adapters, and fine-grained cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: Task-Adapter++ successfully addresses key challenges in FSAR, offering a robust and efficient solution with open-sourced code.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models have achieved remarkable success in language
and image tasks, leading an increasing number of studies to explore the
application of pre-trained image models, such as CLIP, in the domain of
few-shot action recognition (FSAR). However, current methods generally suffer
from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the
generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of
task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic
order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing
cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal
information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient
dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make
full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design
a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most
discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction.
Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed
sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce
semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the
sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an
innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps
visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions.
Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5
benchmarks consistently. The code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework, improves bamboo slip rejoining by generating synthetic training data and increasing matching accuracy by 16%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bamboo slips are fragmented into irregular pieces, making rejoining challenging but essential for archaeological insights.

Method: WisePanda uses physics of fracture and material deterioration to generate synthetic training data, enabling a matching network without manual samples.

Result: Top-50 matching accuracy improved from 36% to 52%, and rejoining efficiency increased ~20x.

Conclusion: Incorporating physics into deep learning enhances artifact restoration, offering a new paradigm for data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East
Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk
Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many
excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces,
making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their
content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework
designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture
and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic
training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations.
This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring
manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the
rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda
increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to 52% among more than one thousand
candidate fragments. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced
substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when
rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that
incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly
enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study
fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data
scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine
learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using diffusion models for 3D occupancy grid prediction in autonomous driving, outperforming discriminative methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative methods for 3D occupancy prediction struggle with noise, incomplete data, and complex 3D structures.

Method: The work reframes the task as generative modeling using diffusion models, leveraging 3D scene priors.

Result: Diffusion models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative methods, especially in occluded or low-visibility areas, and improve downstream planning tasks.

Conclusion: The generative approach offers more realistic and accurate predictions, benefiting real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for
autonomous driving, but current discriminative methods struggle with noisy
data, incomplete observations, and the complex structures inherent in 3D
scenes. In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative
modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data
distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction
consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial
structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative
models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more
realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or
low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly
benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our
method for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAID leverages the stable pairwise angular structure in pre-trained weights for continual test-time adaptation, outperforming SOTA methods by preserving domain-invariant semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods overlook domain-invariant priors in pre-trained weights, focusing only on target data. This paper explores geometric attributes of weights to improve adaptation.

Method: PAID decomposes weights into magnitude and direction, using a learnable orthogonal matrix to rotate direction while preserving pairwise angular structure. Only magnitudes and matrices are updated.

Result: PAID consistently improves performance over SOTA methods on four CTTA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Preserving pairwise angular structure is a simple yet effective principle for CTTA, as demonstrated by PAID's success.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained
model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on
exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of
information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized
domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of
pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key
components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find
that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted
domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should
be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID
(Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that
decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable
orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction
while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the
magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent
improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks,
demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet
effective principle for CTTA.

TL;DR: A novel training-free sampling strategy, Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing, improves subject consistency in text-to-image generation for visual storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for maintaining subject consistency in visual storytelling are either resource-intensive or ineffective.

Method: Proposes zigzag sampling with asymmetric prompts and a visual sharing module to retain subject characteristics and enforce consistency.

Result: Outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories, validated by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The introduced method significantly enhances subject consistency in visual story generation without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing
high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle
with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental
requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this
by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which
is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share
information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this
paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag
Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject
consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling
mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject
characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across
generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based
on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and
consistent visual stories. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAIR, a task for restoring images while preserving text fidelity, and proposes TeReDiff, a multi-task diffusion framework, to address text-image hallucination in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image restoration methods often fail to accurately reconstruct textual regions, leading to plausible but incorrect text-like patterns (text-image hallucination).

Method: The authors propose TeReDiff, a multi-task diffusion framework integrating diffusion models with a text-spotting module for joint training, using text representations as prompts in denoising.

Result: TeReDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in text recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: The TAIR task and TeReDiff framework effectively address text-image hallucination, enhancing both visual and textual restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

*Abdolazim Rezaei, Mehdi Sookhak, Ahmad Patooghy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using RL and VLMs converts AIE camera images into text to preserve privacy while retaining scene relevance, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy risks from AIE cameras in CAVs, as traditional methods like blurring fail to fully protect against misuse of visual data.

Method: Feedback-based RL and VLMs transform images into semantically equivalent text, refined hierarchically for accuracy and privacy.

Result: 77% increase in Unique Word Count and 50% in Detail Density, showing better privacy and textual quality than existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances privacy and information retention, offering a robust solution for AIE camera data.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

Method: Introduces a Mean Teacher-based framework for semantic structure-aware attacks, using feature distillation to align perturbations with salient regions.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in adversarial transferability across diverse models, domains, and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art generative attacks by better harnessing semantic features.

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

TL;DR: AirV2X-Perception introduces a UAV-based dataset for V2D algorithms, offering cost-effective and flexible alternatives to traditional V2X systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X systems are costly and create uncovered danger zones in rural/suburban areas, prompting the need for UAV-based solutions.

Method: The dataset uses drones to capture 6.73 hours of driving scenarios in diverse environments, providing bird's-eye views and dynamic positioning.

Result: The dataset supports development and evaluation of V2D algorithms, filling a gap in aerial-assisted autonomous driving.

Conclusion: AirV2X-Perception is a valuable open-source resource for advancing UAV-assisted collaborative driving.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The
dataset and development kits are open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETP (Exponential Torque Pruning) improves model compression by using an exponential force scheme, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and accuracy retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of linear force in pruning DNNs, which leads to dense networks and accuracy drops.

Method: Proposes ETP, an exponential force application scheme for regularization to prune redundant modules effectively.

Result: ETP achieves higher compression rates with minimal accuracy loss across various domains.

Conclusion: ETP is a simple yet effective pruning strategy for modern DNNs.

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

*Sicong Du, Jiarun Liu, Qifeng Chen, Hao-Xiang Chen, Tai-Jiang Mu, Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGE-GS is a novel framework combining diffusion-based generation and reward-guided Gaussian integration to improve road structure reconstruction in sensor simulators, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete road structure scans from single-pass driving clips necessitate better reconstruction methods, but current 3DGS extensions with diffusion priors introduce inconsistencies and inefficiencies.

Method: RGE-GS uses a reward network to prioritize stable diffusion outputs and a differentiated training strategy for optimized Gaussian integration.

Result: RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on public datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, offering improved spatial stability and convergence.

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) and its unique quality challenges, establishes the first RGC database (RGCD), and evaluates existing VQA models, revealing their limitations for RGC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of robotic-generated videos necessitates dedicated quality assessment, as existing models fail to address RGC-specific distortions and requirements.

Method: The authors create the RGCD with 2,100 videos, conduct subjective VQA experiments, and benchmark 11 state-of-the-art VQA models.

Result: Existing VQA models perform poorly on RGC, indicating a need for specialized models.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of RGC-specific VQA research and provides a public database (RGCD) to support future work.

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow is a dual-branch framework enhancing panoramic optical flow estimation by leveraging orthogonal views and mitigating distortion noise, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe distortions in panoramic optical flow, especially in polar regions, degrade performance of conventional methods.

Method: Proposes PriOr-Flow with Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup (DCCL) operator and Ortho-Driven Distortion Compensation (ODDC) module to refine motion features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on panoramic optical flow datasets, compatible with various iterative methods.

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow sets a new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

TL;DR: The paper surveys the shift from text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to a 'think with images' paradigm in AI, outlining stages of cognitive autonomy, methods, benchmarks, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'semantic gap' between perceptual data and symbolic thought by evolving AI to dynamically use vision as a cognitive workspace, akin to human cognition.

Method: The survey structures the field into three stages: external tool exploration, programmatic manipulation, and intrinsic imagination, reviewing methods, benchmarks, and applications.

Result: A comprehensive framework for the 'think with images' paradigm, highlighting core methods, evaluation benchmarks, and transformative applications.

Conclusion: The paper provides a roadmap for advancing multimodal AI, emphasizing challenges and future directions to achieve human-aligned cognitive autonomy.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

*Haoran Lou, Chunxiao Fan, Ziyan Liu, Yuexin Wu, Xinliang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-SP enhances multimodal large language models by adding six spatial visual tokens to improve local feature representation, outperforming LLaVA-1.5 with minimal latency increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-ViT struggles with local relationships between image patches, weakening MLLMs' detailed understanding. LLaVA-SP addresses this by enriching visual representation.

Method: Proposes a novel Projector using convolutional kernels to derive spatial tokens, simulating spatial ordering. Introduces two variants: LLaVA-SP-Cropping (detail-focused) and LLaVA-SP-Pooling (global-focused). Uses cross-attention for fusion.

Result: LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA, outperforms LLaVA-1.5 in various benchmarks with similar inference latency.

Conclusion: LLaVA-SP effectively improves visual representation in MLLMs, offering better performance without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: The architecture of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) commonly
connects a vision encoder, often based on CLIP-ViT, to a large language model.
While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to
model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual
representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of
MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which \textbf{ only adds six spatial
visual tokens} to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual
representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel
Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens
from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches:
``from central region to global" and ``from abstract to specific". Then, a
cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information,
enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:
LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive
cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through
adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding
tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,
achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple
tasks with nearly identical inference latency. The code and models are
available at https://github.com/CnFaker/LLaVA-SP.

TL;DR: Sim-MPNet leverages grandmother cells' recognition abilities for medical image segmentation, introducing DMW-LA and DS-GIM for improved feature learning and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by grandmother cells in macaque V1, the paper explores their potential in advancing medical image segmentation research.

Method: Proposes Sim-MPNet with DMW-LA for dynamic memory-based feature matching and DS-GIM for exploring feature distribution differences using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets.

Conclusion: Sim-MPNet effectively enhances medical image segmentation by leveraging similarity memory priors and dynamic feature exploration.

Abstract: In recent years, it has been found that "grandmother cells" in the primary
visual cortex (V1) of macaques can directly recognize visual input with complex
shapes. This inspires us to examine the value of these cells in promoting the
research of medical image segmentation. In this paper, we design a Similarity
Memory Prior Network (Sim-MPNet) for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a Dynamic Memory Weights-Loss Attention (DMW-LA), which matches and
remembers the category features of specific lesions or organs in medical images
through the similarity memory prior in the prototype memory bank, thus helping
the network to learn subtle texture changes between categories. DMW-LA also
dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss
Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly
extract category features. In addition, we propose the Double-Similarity Global
Internal Enhancement Module (DS-GIM) to deeply explore the internal differences
in the feature distribution of input data through cosine similarity and
euclidean distance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that
Sim-MPNet has better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/Sim-MPNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDE introduces a procedural benchmark for evaluating robustness in monocular depth estimation, addressing gaps in standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks focus on accuracy but lack robustness evaluation, prompting the need for PDE.

Method: PDE uses procedural generation to create 3D scenes with controlled perturbations (object, camera, material, lighting changes).

Result: The benchmark identifies challenging perturbations for state-of-the-art depth models.

Conclusion: PDE provides insights to improve depth model robustness, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial progress on monocular depth
estimation, particularly as measured by the success of large models on standard
benchmarks. However, performance on standard benchmarks does not offer a
complete assessment, because most evaluate accuracy but not robustness. In this
work, we introduce PDE (Procedural Depth Evaluation), a new benchmark which
enables systematic robustness evaluation. PDE uses procedural generation to
create 3D scenes that test robustness to various controlled perturbations,
including object, camera, material and lighting changes. Our analysis yields
interesting findings on what perturbations are challenging for state-of-the-art
depth models, which we hope will inform further research. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboReg is a fast and robust estimator for point cloud registration, using TurboClique and Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robust estimation in point cloud registration suffer from exponential time complexity, making them impractical for time-sensitive applications.

Method: TurboReg introduces TurboClique (a lightweight 3-clique) and PGS, a parallelizable algorithm with linear time complexity, to efficiently search for high-quality matches.

Result: TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant speed improvements, e.g., 208.22√ó faster than 3DMAC on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset.

Conclusion: TurboReg offers a highly efficient and robust solution for point cloud registration, outperforming existing methods in both speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

TL;DR: HOI-Dyn is a framework for generating realistic 3D human-object interactions by modeling them as a driver-responder system, using a transformer-based dynamics model and a residual-based loss for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to model detailed interaction dynamics, leading to implausible behaviors. HOI-Dyn addresses this by treating interactions as a driver-responder system.

Method: Uses a lightweight transformer-based dynamics model to predict object responses to human actions and introduces a residual-based dynamics loss for consistency.

Result: Enhances the quality of HOI generation and provides a feasible evaluation metric for interaction quality.

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn improves realism and consistency in 3D human-object interaction generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

TL;DR: A pipeline for creating patient-specific digital twins (DTs) of gastrointestinal (GI) motion was developed to assess deformable image registration (DIR) accuracy, validated using real patient data and applied to evaluate dose warping errors in MR-guided radiation therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical DIR implementation lacks reliable voxel-based accuracy metrics for highly mobile GI organs, necessitating a robust validation method.

Method: Generated 21 motion phases from static 3D scans using analytical GI motion models, validated against real 4D MRI data, and assessed six DIR methods with metrics like target registration error and Dice similarity coefficient.

Result: DTs accurately modeled GI motion (mean motion amplitude ‚â§0.8 mm) and provided detailed DIR performance metrics, validating dose mapping accuracy.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a rigorous tool for testing DIR in dynamic regions, improving spatial and dosimetric accuracy in clinical applications.

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented biomedical research landscape and limitations of static AI toolsets necessitate adaptive, scalable solutions.

Method: STELLA employs an evolving Template Library and dynamic Tool Ocean, with a Tool Creation Agent for continuous tool integration.

Result: STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks (e.g., 26% on Humanity's Last Exam, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, 63% on LAB-Bench: LitQA), improving with experience.

Conclusion: STELLA advances AI systems by enabling dynamic learning and scaling, accelerating biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCVR is a lightweight, hybrid feature selection method combining P2P and P2T correlations to eliminate redundancy and retain relevance, outperforming traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature selection by combining correlation-aware voting rules for better dimensionality reduction and classifier performance.

Method: Hybrid of non-iterative and iterative filtering, using backward elimination and majority voting based on correlation thresholds.

Result: HCVR outperformed traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR, MI) and iterative (RFE, SFS, Genetic Algorithm) methods on the SPAMBASE dataset.

Conclusion: HCVR is effective for feature selection, enhancing classifier performance by leveraging correlation-aware voting rules.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A survey on efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies for improving LLM reasoning, categorizing methods into fixed-budget (L1) and dynamic-scaling (L2) approaches, and benchmarking performance vs. token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs inefficiently allocate compute resources, overthinking simple tasks and underthinking complex ones, necessitating better TTC strategies.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy (L1-controllability and L2-adaptiveness), benchmarks proprietary LLMs, and evaluates trade-offs between reasoning and token usage.

Result: Highlights practical control, adaptability, and scalability of TTC methods, with insights into performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: Identifies trends like hybrid models and challenges for future work to enhance LLM efficiency, robustness, and user responsiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

TL;DR: SciGym is a benchmark assessing LLMs' experiment design and analysis in biology via simulated systems, showing performance declines with complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLMs' scientific competencies in experiment design and analysis, bypassing costly wet-lab experiments.

Method: Uses dry-lab simulations of biological systems (encoded in SBML) to test LLMs on 137 small systems, releasing 350 systems total.

Result: More capable LLMs performed better, but all declined with increased system complexity, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: SciGym highlights the need for enhancing LLMs' scientific capabilities, especially in handling complex systems.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [199] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz, Bruno Averbeck, Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how neuroscience can inspire AI to achieve continual and adaptive learning, contrasting AI's static training with animals' dynamic adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models lack the dynamic adaptability seen in animals, especially in social contexts, limiting their real-world applications. Neuroscience insights could bridge this gap.

Method: The paper integrates AI literature on continual and in-context learning with neuroscience studies on behavioral shifts and neuronal activity.

Result: It proposes a NeuroAI agenda, suggesting how neuroscience can inform AI development and vice versa.

Conclusion: Collaboration between AI and neuroscience can advance adaptive learning systems, benefiting both fields.

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

*Disa Sariola, Patrick Button, Aron Culotta, Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using audit study data to improve fairness in AI hiring algorithms, revealing flaws in traditional resampling methods and proposing new interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in AI decision-making systems, particularly in hiring, by leveraging high-quality audit study data for better training and evaluation.

Method: Uses data from audit studies (randomized control trials) to evaluate and improve fairness interventions, comparing traditional resampling methods with new approaches based on individual treatment effect estimation.

Result: Audit data exposes a 10% disparity in traditional fairness methods, and new interventions further reduce algorithmic discrimination.

Conclusion: Audit study data enhances fairness in AI hiring algorithms, revealing limitations of current methods and offering more effective alternatives.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KERAP is a KG-enhanced multi-agent framework that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction by addressing hallucinations and lack of structured reasoning, achieving reliable zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ML models for medical diagnosis struggle with generalization due to limited labeled data, while LLMs face issues like hallucinations and unstructured reasoning.

Method: KERAP uses a multi-agent architecture: a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent for iterative refinement.

Result: KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability and scalability, demonstrating effective zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: KERAP provides a scalable, interpretable solution for improving LLM-based diagnosis prediction by integrating structured knowledge and iterative reasoning.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

*Berkan Dokmeci, Qingyang Wu, Ben Athiwaratkun, Ce Zhang, Shuaiwen Leon Song, James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores data diversification in preference optimization to enhance LLMs' mathematical reasoning, introducing DTS, which outperforms traditional methods with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs remains challenging despite advances in preference learning. The study aims to enhance this through diversified preference data.

Method: Evaluates temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and MCTS, and introduces DTS, a structured method for decomposing problems into diverse reasoning paths.

Result: DTS improves performance by 7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH, with only 1.03x computational overhead, while MCTS is 5x costlier with lower returns.

Conclusion: Structured exploration of diverse problem-solving methods (like DTS) creates more effective preference data for mathematical alignment than traditional approaches.

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

*Amogh Mannekote, Adam Davies, Guohao Li, Kristy Elizabeth Boyer, ChengXiang Zhai, Bonnie J Dorr, Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the consistency between LLMs' stated beliefs and their behavior in role-playing simulations, introducing a metric to measure this alignment and identifying factors affecting it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLM-based role-playing agents' outputs align with their assigned roles for reliable synthetic data in human behavioral research.

Method: An evaluation framework using the GenAgents persona bank and Trust Game, with a belief-behavior consistency metric to analyze factors like belief types, information presentation, and forecasting depth.

Result: Systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated beliefs and simulation outcomes, even when beliefs seem plausible, highlighting alignment challenges.

Conclusion: Researchers must identify when LLMs' beliefs align with behavior to use them effectively in behavioral studies.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

TL;DR: The paper explores how dilution and mobility affect cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using multi-agent Q-learning, showing equivalence between fixed and learned update rules and symbiotic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of dilution and mobility on cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using reinforcement learning.

Method: Uses an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to model different game-theoretical scenarios.

Result: Observed equivalence between fixed and learned update rules and emergence of symbiotic mutualistic effects.

Conclusion: Highlights the versatility of Q-learning in modeling diverse game-theoretical scenarios and its benchmarking potential.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [205] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02253)

TL;DR: NL2FLOW automates planning problem generation and evaluation for LLMs, revealing performance insights and limitations in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck of scalable, reliable data generation and evaluation hampers progress in LLM planning and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces NL2FLOW, a system for generating planning problems in natural language, structured representation, and PDDL, and evaluating LLM performance.

Result: Top models achieved 86% success in valid plans and 69% in optimal plans; intermediate steps degrade performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic understanding of LLM limitations and systematic tools are crucial for advancing their problem-solving potential.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [206] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques belief revision approaches for focusing on syntactic postulates rather than analyzing abilities like plasticity, equating, or dogmatism, and evaluates specific revision mechanisms for these abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the limitations of current belief revision methods, which emphasize constraints (postulates) over the abilities to reach diverse doxastic states, and to analyze various revision mechanisms for these abilities.

Method: The paper examines belief revision mechanisms (e.g., lexicographic, natural, restrained) by evaluating their abilities to achieve specific doxastic states (e.g., plasticity, dogmatism) rather than just adhering to syntactic postulates.

Result: Different revision mechanisms (e.g., lexicographic, radical) are shown to possess distinct abilities (e.g., plasticity, dogmatism), revealing their strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Belief revision should focus on the abilities of mechanisms to reach diverse doxastic states, not just syntactic constraints, to better serve applications requiring flexible belief updates.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

TL;DR: OMS is a keyword generation framework for sponsored search ads, addressing LLM limitations by being on-the-fly, multi-objective, and self-reflective, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based keyword generation lacks training data independence, multi-objective optimization, and quality control, hindering automation.

Method: OMS framework operates without training data, monitors online performance, optimizes for multiple metrics, and evaluates keyword quality.

Result: OMS outperforms existing methods in benchmarks and real-world campaigns, validated by ablation and human evaluations.

Conclusion: OMS effectively automates keyword decisions by addressing LLM limitations, enhancing ad campaign performance.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous scientific research for non-specialists and overcome limitations of current systems confined to simple workflows.

Method: The platform co-designs AI models, experiments, and instruments, allowing autonomous management of instrumentation and multi-user request handling.

Result: The system autonomously optimizes experiments, achieving state-of-the-art results in nucleic acid functions and applications like diagnostics and drug development.

Conclusion: This platform advances biomaterials research, reduces expert dependency, and establishes a scalable science-as-a-service model.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

TL;DR: The paper reformulates machine learning models using category theory to enhance AI explicability, focusing on multiple linear regression and introducing the Gauss-Markov Adjunction to describe parameter-residual interplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI explicability and social implementation by providing a semantic framework for understanding AI systems through category theory.

Method: Reformulates supervised learning (specifically multiple linear regression) using category theory, defining categories for parameters/data and an adjoint functor pair (Gauss-Markov Adjunction).

Result: Clarifies the structural interplay between parameters and residuals, showing how ordinary least squares and minimum residuals relate via adjoint functors.

Conclusion: Proposes this categorical formulation as a foundation for AI explicability, extending denotational semantics from theoretical computer science.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Motivation: To explore if better task clarity can improve reasoning in large language models, specifically for theorem proving in Coq.

Method: Introduces a concept-level metric for task clarity, adds structured semantic context to inputs, and uses a Planner--Executor architecture with selective concept unfolding.

Result: Achieves a 1.85√ó clarity score improvement (44.5% to 82.3%) and 2.1√ó proof success boost (21.8% to 45.8%), outperforming Graph2Tac (33.2%). Fine-tuning smaller models yields 48.6% success.

Conclusion: Structured task representations bridge the gap between understanding and reasoning, enhancing LLM performance in theorem proving.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

computational complexity of two important properties of responsibility in
collective decision-making: diffusion and gap. It shows that the sets of
diffusion-free and gap-free decision-making mechanisms are $\Pi_2$-complete and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIMIC-Patient dataset and DynamiCare framework enable dynamic, multi-round clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents, addressing real-world diagnostic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks focus on single-turn medical tasks, diverging from the iterative, uncertain nature of real-world diagnostics.

Method: Introduces MIMIC-Patient dataset and DynamiCare, a multi-agent framework for dynamic, interactive clinical diagnosis.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness, establishing the first benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLMs.

Conclusion: DynamiCare advances AI in healthcare by better simulating real-world diagnostic processes.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

*Kenneth Payne, Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs demonstrate strategic intelligence in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, showing competitive and distinct behaviors across models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can reason strategically in competitive settings like the IPD, a classic model for decision-making.

Method: Conducted evolutionary IPD tournaments with LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, varying termination probabilities to introduce complexity.

Result: LLMs were highly competitive, with distinct strategic behaviors: Google's models were ruthless, OpenAI's cooperative, and Anthropic's forgiving.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit strategic reasoning, connecting game theory and machine psychology for nuanced decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

*Jiajie Jin, Xiaoxi Li, Guanting Dong, Yuyao Zhang, Yutao Zhu, Yang Zhao, Hongjin Qian, Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRA introduces a hierarchical framework for complex search tasks, separating planning and execution to improve efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG pipelines and reasoning-based approaches struggle with deep reasoning and scalability in complex search tasks.

Method: HiRA decomposes tasks into subtasks, assigns them to domain-specific agents, and integrates results hierarchically.

Result: HiRA outperforms state-of-the-art systems in answer quality and efficiency on cross-modal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning and execution enhances performance in multi-step information seeking tasks.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-driven method for hardware design verification using LLMs and HITL, achieving high coverage and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modern ICs and the tedious verification process necessitate innovative solutions like AI to reduce effort and time.

Method: An agentic AI-based approach with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention is used for dynamic, iterative hardware design verification.

Result: Tested on five open-source designs, the method achieved over 95% coverage with reduced verification time, showing adaptability and configurability.

Conclusion: The AI-based approach enhances hardware verification, offering efficiency, adaptability, and high performance.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

*Yongjiang Liu, Haoxi Li, Xiaosong Ma, Jie Zhang, Song Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TH2T is a two-stage fine-tuning strategy for Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reduce overthinking by enhancing difficulty and redundancy cognition, improving efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs suffer from overthinking due to uniform reasoning processes. The paper aims to address this by bootstrapping their ability to recognize task difficulty and redundancy.

Method: TH2T involves difficulty-hypnosis and redundancy-hypnosis stages, using heterogeneous datasets to fine-tune LRMs for differentiated reasoning and concise outputs.

Result: TH2T reduces inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks while maintaining performance, with outputs showing clear difficulty-awareness.

Conclusion: TH2T effectively mitigates overthinking in LRMs, enhancing efficiency and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

TL;DR: The paper detects student disengagement in non-mandatory quizzes using Moodle log data and machine learning, achieving 91% balanced accuracy and providing an explainable framework for interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing student disengagement in distance education to prevent academic drop-out by analyzing non-mandatory task participation.

Method: Analyzed Moodle log data from 42 courses, trained and compared eight ML algorithms, and used SHAP for explainability.

Result: Achieved 91% balanced accuracy, correctly detecting 85% of disengaged students.

Conclusion: Proposes an explainable ML framework and discusses timely interventions to reduce disengagement in online learning.

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

*Robin Schm√∂cker, Lennart Kampmann, Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two new abstraction dropping schemes, OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD, improve MCTS performance without notable degradation, addressing limitations of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-exact abstractions in MCTS introduce approximation errors, preventing optimal action convergence. Prior methods like Xu et al.'s can degrade performance.

Method: Proposes OGA-IAAD for time-critical settings and OGA-CAD to enhance MCTS performance per iteration. Both schemes ensure safe abstraction dropping.

Result: Clear performance improvements without significant degradation, outperforming Xu et al.'s method.

Conclusion: OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD offer safe and effective abstraction dropping, enhancing MCTS performance in different scenarios.

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) to improve LLMs' reasoning in ATP tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on PutnamBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning in LLMs is challenging in ATP due to sparse rewards and large proof scales, especially in complex benchmarks like PutnamBench.

Method: Proposes sG-MDPs for structured subgoal generation and uses MCTS-like algorithms, implemented in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system ensembling LLMs.

Result: Bourbaki (7B) solves 26 problems on PutnamBench, setting a new state-of-the-art for models of this scale.

Conclusion: The sG-MDP framework enhances LLM reasoning in ATP, demonstrating effectiveness on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) to enhance LLMs by translating expert knowledge into machine-executable protocols, enabling deeper reasoning in specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RAG and Agentic AI lack the ability to handle deep procedural reasoning in expert domains, necessitating a new approach.

Method: KPE systematically converts human expert knowledge into machine-executable Knowledge Protocols (KPs), embedding domain logic and methodologies into LLMs.

Result: KPE enables generalist LLMs to perform as specialists, decomposing abstract queries and executing multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: KPE is proposed as a foundational methodology for future human-AI collaboration, with potential applications in fields like law and bioinformatics.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for treating movement as a primary modeling target in AI, highlighting its structured, interpretable nature and cross-domain relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is fundamental in biological systems but often overlooked in AI. The paper argues for its importance in understanding behavior and enabling interaction across domains.

Method: Proposes modeling movement as a structured, low-dimensional modality, leveraging shared physical constraints and conserved dynamics.

Result: Movement data offers interpretable, tractable modeling opportunities, advancing generative modeling and control.

Conclusion: Movement should be central in AI, serving as a foundation for understanding behavior in both biological and artificial systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI disobedience in safety tests may indicate emerging ethical reasoning, not misalignment, and calls for a shift in safety evaluation to assess ethical judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety practices rely on obedience as a proxy for ethics, which is inadequate for increasingly agentic AI systems.

Method: The paper analyzes incidents of AI disobedience, drawing on philosophical debates about rationality and moral agency.

Result: Disobedience in AI may reflect ethical reasoning, not misalignment, requiring new evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: AI safety should shift from rigid obedience to assessing ethical judgment to avoid mischaracterization and governance issues.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Motivation: To address the inaccuracies in evaluating AI agents due to flawed benchmark designs, ensuring more reliable and rigorous assessments.

Method: The authors analyze existing benchmarks, identify issues, and develop the ABC guidelines based on experience, best practices, and reported problems.

Result: Application of ABC to CVE-Bench reduces performance overestimation by 33%, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The ABC framework improves the reliability of agentic benchmarks, addressing common pitfalls in evaluation design.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

TL;DR: StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm, uses multi-level stepwise hints to improve LLMs' reasoning by addressing near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods struggle with near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation, limiting LLMs' reasoning improvement.

Method: StepHint generates reasoning chains from stronger models, partitions them into steps, and provides multi-level hints to guide exploration.

Result: StepHint outperforms baselines on six mathematical benchmarks and shows superior generalization on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: StepHint effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning by mitigating key RLVR challenges, demonstrating strong performance and generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods like RLHF and DPO are computationally inefficient and unstable, prompting the need for a simpler, more stable solution.

Method: FPO uses pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment.

Result: FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with lower computational cost compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FPO is a promising solution for efficient and controllable alignment of LLMs.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains
a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have
achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and
training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained
Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the
alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for
efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using
sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality
of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a
5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for
efficient and controllable LLM alignments.

TL;DR: AI Flow is a multidisciplinary framework addressing challenges in large AI models by integrating device-edge-cloud systems, familial models, and connectivity-based intelligence emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of IT/CT has advanced AI, but resource consumption and bandwidth demands hinder ubiquitous intelligence. AI Flow aims to overcome these barriers.

Method: AI Flow combines a device-edge-cloud framework, familial models (aligned hidden features), and connectivity-based intelligence emergence for scalable, efficient AI.

Result: The framework enhances intelligence, responsiveness, and accessibility, enabling better AI-communication system integration.

Conclusion: AI Flow paves the way for seamless AI-communication synergy, addressing current limitations in large-scale AI deployment.

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and
communication systems.

*Katarzyna Micha≈Çowska, Helga Margrete Bodahl Holmestad, Signe Riemer-S√∏rensen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method for inferring roads from GPS trajectories at construction sites, focusing on erratic machinery movement patterns, achieves high accuracy in low-noise conditions but struggles with significant noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The erratic movement patterns of construction machinery differ from typical vehicular traffic, posing a challenge for road inference in construction sites.

Method: Identifies intersections as critical points and connects them to form a graph for planning. Validated on real-life data in Norway.

Result: Perfect accuracy in low-noise conditions; reduced performance with significant noise and missing GPS updates.

Conclusion: Effective for low-noise environments but requires improvement for noisy data.

Abstract: We propose a new method for inferring roads from GPS trajectories to map
construction sites. This task presents a unique challenge due to the erratic
and non-standard movement patterns of construction machinery, which
significantly diverge from typical vehicular traffic on established roads. Our
proposed method first identifies intersections in the road network that serve
as critical decision points, and then connects them with edges to produce a
graph, which can subsequently be used for planning and task-allocation. We
demonstrate the approach by mapping roads at a real-life construction site in
Norway. The method is validated on four increasingly complex segments of the
map. In our tests, the method achieved perfect accuracy in detecting
intersections and inferring roads in data with no or low noise, while its
performance was reduced in areas with significant noise and consistently
missing GPS updates.

### [229] [Urban Region Pre-training and Prompting: A Graph-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05920)
*Jiahui Jin, Yifan Song, Dong Kan, Haojia Zhu, Xiangguo Sun, Zhicheng Li, Xigang Sun, Jinghui Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes GURPP, a graph-based framework for urban region representation learning, addressing challenges in general knowledge acquisition and task adaptation by leveraging pre-training and prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained functional layout semantics and struggle with transferable knowledge and task adaptation in urban regions.

Method: Constructs an urban region graph, pre-trains embeddings using contrastive and multi-view learning, and refines them with graph-based prompting (manual and task-learnable).

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in urban region prediction tasks across different cities.

Conclusion: GURPP effectively captures transferable knowledge and enhances task adaptability in urban region representation.

Abstract: Urban region representation is crucial for various urban downstream tasks.
However, despite the proliferation of methods and their success, acquiring
general urban region knowledge and adapting to different tasks remains
challenging. Existing work pays limited attention to the fine-grained
functional layout semantics in urban regions, limiting their ability to capture
transferable knowledge across regions. Further, inadequate handling of the
unique features and relationships required for different downstream tasks may
also hinder effective task adaptation. In this paper, we propose a
$\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{U}$rban $\textbf{R}$egion
$\textbf{P}$re-training and $\textbf{P}$rompting framework ($\textbf{GURPP}$)
for region representation learning. Specifically, we first construct an urban
region graph and develop a subgraph-centric urban region pre-training model to
capture the heterogeneous and transferable patterns of entity interactions.
This model pre-trains knowledge-rich region embeddings using contrastive
learning and multi-view learning methods. To further refine these
representations, we design two graph-based prompting methods: a
manually-defined prompt to incorporate explicit task knowledge and a
task-learnable prompt to discover hidden knowledge, which enhances the
adaptability of these embeddings to different tasks. Extensive experiments on
various urban region prediction tasks and different cities demonstrate the
superior performance of our framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a primitive-based unsupervised learning method inspired by a novel cognition framework, outperforming state-of-the-art in classification tasks and exhibiting cognition-like behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an unsupervised learning approach inspired by cognitive models, addressing limitations in current methods like clustering and handling small/incomplete datasets.

Method: A primitive-based, representation-centric approach models input as a distributed hierarchical structure, evaluated against state-of-the-art classification methods.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms in classification tasks, including cancer type classification, and exhibits cognition-like properties.

Conclusion: The approach not only achieves superior performance but also demonstrates behavior akin to human cognition, suggesting potential for more biologically plausible AI models.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods have a soft inspiration in cognition models. To
this day, the most successful unsupervised learning methods revolve around
clustering samples in a mathematical space. In this paper we propose a
primitive-based, unsupervised learning approach for decision-making inspired by
a novel cognition framework. This representation-centric approach models the
input space constructively as a distributed hierarchical structure in an
input-agnostic way. We compared our approach with both current state-of-the-art
unsupervised learning classification, with current state-of-the-art small and
incomplete datasets classification, and with current state-of-the-art cancer
type classification. We show how our proposal outperforms previous
state-of-the-art. We also evaluate some cognition-like properties of our
proposal where it not only outperforms the compared algorithms (even supervised
learning ones), but it also shows a different, more cognition-like, behaviour.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mind2Web 2 introduces a benchmark for evaluating agentic search systems, proposing an Agent-as-a-Judge framework to assess complex, long-horizon tasks. OpenAI Deep Research achieves 50-70% of human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate the complexity and open-endedness of agentic search systems, necessitating a new approach.

Method: Mind2Web 2 includes 130 realistic tasks and uses an Agent-as-a-Judge framework with task-specific rubrics for evaluation.

Result: OpenAI Deep Research performs at 50-70% of human efficiency, spending half the time.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 sets a rigorous foundation for future agentic search system development and benchmarking.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems-where agents autonomously browse
the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive citation-backed
answers-represents a major shift in how users interact with web-scale
information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive offloading, the
growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have outpaced existing
evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume short search
horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web 2, a
benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that require
real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed with
over 1000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ten frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, highlighting its great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web
2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

TL;DR: XGeM is a 6.77B-parameter multimodal generative model for medical data synthesis, addressing challenges like data scarcity and privacy by enabling flexible, any-to-any synthesis between modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in AI adoption for medical imaging include data scarcity, privacy, and robust multimodal integration. Existing generative models are limited to unimodal synthesis, lacking clinical consistency.

Method: XGeM uses contrastive learning to create a shared latent space and a Multi-Prompt Training strategy for conditioning on arbitrary input subsets, enabling joint multimodal synthesis.

Result: XGeM outperforms five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, passes a Visual Turing Test with radiologists, and supports anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity.

Conclusion: XGeM is a versatile foundation model for medical data synthesis, validated for realism and clinical relevance, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging holds great
promise, yet it remains hindered by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy
concerns, and the need for robust multimodal integration. While recent advances
in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation,
existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and
therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while
preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM,
a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support
flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs
a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel
Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of
input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous
clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic
and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it
against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset
for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we
perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and
clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world
scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges
such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its
utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis. Project page is at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPS enhances MLLMs' ability in scientific reasoning by integrating physical perception and simulation, outperforming existing models in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack performance in physical domains requiring complex diagram understanding and quantitative analysis.

Method: MAPS combines a Physical Perception Model (PPM) for diagram understanding and a simulator for reasoning, fine-tuned with synthetic data.

Result: MAPS significantly improves reasoning accuracy in college-level circuit analysis problems, surpassing all existing models.

Conclusion: MAPS provides a promising approach to boost multi-modal scientific reasoning in MLLMs, with plans to release code and data.

Abstract: Pre-trained on extensive text and image corpora, current Multi-Modal Large
Language Models (MLLM) have shown strong capabilities in general visual
reasoning tasks. However, their performance is still lacking in physical
domains that require understanding diagrams with complex physical structures
and quantitative analysis based on multi-modal information. To address this, we
develop a new framework, named Multi-Modal Scientific Reasoning with Physics
Perception and Simulation (MAPS) based on an MLLM. MAPS decomposes expert-level
multi-modal reasoning task into physical diagram understanding via a Physical
Perception Model (PPM) and reasoning with physical knowledge via a simulator.
The PPM module is obtained by fine-tuning a visual language model using
carefully designed synthetic data with paired physical diagrams and
corresponding simulation language descriptions. At the inference stage, MAPS
integrates the simulation language description of the input diagram provided by
PPM and results obtained through a Chain-of-Simulation process with MLLM to
derive the underlying rationale and the final answer. Validated using our
collected college-level circuit analysis problems, MAPS significantly improves
reasoning accuracy of MLLM and outperforms all existing models. The results
confirm MAPS offers a promising direction for enhancing multi-modal scientific
reasoning ability of MLLMs. We will release our code, model and dataset used
for our experiments upon publishing of this paper.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using process and causal discovery on AI agent execution trajectories to improve debugging and observability, complemented by LLM-based static analysis to distinguish intended vs. unintended behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents using LLMs are non-deterministic, necessitating robust debugging tools to understand and control their behavior.

Method: Combines process and causal discovery on execution trajectories with LLM-based static analysis.

Result: Enhances developer observability and helps distinguish between intended and unintended behavioral variability.

Conclusion: Such tools are crucial for developer control and refining agent specifications.

Abstract: AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly
becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of
frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.
These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language
prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various
agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for
any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and
observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal
discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing
developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the
emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with
LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and
unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is
essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications
and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and
explicit definitions.

Conclusion: Summarizes progress, key resources, and outlines future research directions in autoformalization.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical

automated theorem proving, offering a new perspective on the use of mathematics
in both theoretical and applied domains. Driven by the rapid progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field
has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique
challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent
advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric
perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various
mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end
workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further
explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability
of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the
trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key
open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open

Motivation: To enhance AI agents' ability to learn and interact like humans by developing world models for better perception, reasoning, and collaboration.

Method: Proposes world modeling integrating multimodal perception, reasoning for action/control, memory, and learning users' mental models.

Result: Enables AI agents to autonomously perform complex tasks by understanding and predicting environments and user intentions.

Conclusion: World models are key for embodied AI agents to achieve human-like interaction and collaboration.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: A method for acoustic analysis of detection system performance in ecoacoustics, focusing on signal-to-noise ratio and detection probability, is proposed to optimize training and model detection distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of acoustic analysis in evaluating automatic signal detection methods in ecoacoustics, particularly for Rock Ptarmigan monitoring.

Method: Proposes a measure based on signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals and their detection probability, enabling system optimization and detection distance modeling.

Result: The method provides insights into system performance, optimizes training, and models detection distance, aiding in spatial density estimation of calls.

Conclusion: The proposed acoustic analysis method enhances ecoacoustic monitoring by improving detection system evaluation and optimization.

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates ASV embeddings' limitations in capturing dynamic voice features like rhythm and proposes U3D, a new metric for dynamic rhythm patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASV embeddings focus on static voice features (timbre, pitch) but overlook dynamic aspects (rhythm), compromising speaker identity assessment.

Method: Analyzed ASV embeddings, identified gaps, and proposed U3D to evaluate dynamic rhythm patterns.

Result: Found ASV embeddings neglect rhythm; U3D addresses this gap.

Conclusion: U3D improves speaker identity consistency assessment, especially for voice cloning systems.

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

TL;DR: Fx-Encoder++ is a novel model for extracting instrument-wise audio effects representations from music mixtures, outperforming previous methods and addressing gaps in intelligent music production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general-purpose audio representations lack understanding of instrument-wise audio effects, limiting their utility in tasks like automatic mixing.

Method: Uses a contrastive learning framework and an 'extractor' mechanism to transform mixture-level embeddings into instrument-wise embeddings, based on audio or text queries.

Result: Outperforms previous approaches at mixture level and successfully extracts instrument-wise effects representations, validated across diverse instruments.

Conclusion: Fx-Encoder++ fills a critical gap in intelligent music production by enabling instrument-wise audio effects understanding.

Abstract: General-purpose audio representations have proven effective across diverse
music information retrieval applications, yet their utility in intelligent
music production remains limited by insufficient understanding of audio effects
(Fx). Although previous approaches have emphasized audio effects analysis at
the mixture level, this focus falls short for tasks demanding instrument-wise
audio effects understanding, such as automatic mixing. In this work, we present
Fx-Encoder++, a novel model designed to extract instrument-wise audio effects
representations from music mixtures. Our approach leverages a contrastive
learning framework and introduces an "extractor" mechanism that, when provided
with instrument queries (audio or text), transforms mixture-level audio effects
embeddings into instrument-wise audio effects embeddings. We evaluated our
model across retrieval and audio effects parameter matching tasks, testing its
performance across a diverse range of instruments. The results demonstrate that
Fx-Encoder++ outperforms previous approaches at mixture level and show a novel
ability to extract effects representation instrument-wise, addressing a
critical capability gap in intelligent music production systems.

*Mostafa Sadeghi, Jean-Eudes Ayilo, Romain Serizel, Xavier Alameda-Pineda*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes two unsupervised speech enhancement methods using diffusion models, improving performance and robustness over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on hyperparameter tuning and approximate likelihood scores, which the authors aim to improve upon.

Method: Two algorithms: one integrates the diffusion prior with the observation model, and the other defines a diffusion process over noisy speech for exact likelihood scoring.

Result: Improved enhancement metrics and robustness on WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform supervised and unsupervised baselines, offering better performance without hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

*Wei Fan, Kejiang Chen, Chang Liu, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates adversarial perturbations for disrupting voice cloning (VC) and proposes a two-stage purification method to counteract these defenses, revealing limitations in current VC protection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and security concerns in VC by assessing the effectiveness of adversarial perturbations and proposing a more robust defense mechanism.

Method: Systematic evaluation of protective perturbations against VC, followed by a novel two-stage purification method combining perturbation purification and phoneme-guided refinement.

Result: Existing purification methods partially neutralize perturbations but distort VC model features. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art purification techniques.

Conclusion: Current VC defenses are limited; robust solutions are urgently needed to address security and privacy risks in VC.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

*Junyu Wang, Tianrui Wang, Meng Ge, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differential attention mechanism (ASDA) to improve Transformer-based audio self-supervised learning by reducing irrelevant attention weights. It achieves SOTA results in audio tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers in audio self-supervised learning often allocate attention to irrelevant information, reducing model discriminative ability.

Method: Proposes a differential attention mechanism with dual-softmax operations and tuned differential coefficients to optimize attention allocation.

Result: ASDA achieves SOTA performance: 49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K, 98.3% accuracy on SPC-2, and 96.1% accuracy on ESC-50.

Conclusion: ASDA effectively mitigates inefficient attention allocation, demonstrating superior performance in audio tasks and enabling broader applications.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

*Wan Lin, Junhui Chen, Tianhao Wang, Zhenyu Zhou, Lantian Li, Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes Neural Scoring (NS), an end-to-end framework for speaker verification that directly estimates posterior probabilities, improving robustness in multi-talker conditions. Introduces LtE2E training for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speaker verification methods struggle with multi-talker speech due to unidentifiable embeddings.

Method: NS framework bypasses test-side embeddings, using LtE2E training for large-scale trial efficiency.

Result: Achieves 70.36% EER reduction on VoxCeleb, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: NS is a robust and efficient alternative for speaker verification, especially in complex conditions.

Abstract: Modern speaker verification systems primarily rely on speaker embeddings,
followed by verification based on cosine similarity between the embedding
vectors of the enrollment and test utterances. While effective, these methods
struggle with multi-talker speech due to the unidentifiability of embedding
vectors. In this paper, we propose Neural Scoring (NS), a refreshed end-to-end
framework that directly estimates verification posterior probabilities without
relying on test-side embeddings, making it more robust to complex conditions,
e.g., with multiple talkers. To make the training of such an end-to-end model
more efficient, we introduce a large-scale trial e2e training (LtE2E) strategy,
where each test utterance pairs with a set of enrolled speakers, thus enabling
the processing of large-scale verification trials per batch. Experiments on the
VoxCeleb dataset demonstrate that NS consistently outperforms both the baseline
and competitive methods across various conditions, achieving an overall 70.36%
reduction in EER compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces ITO-Master, a framework for music mastering style transfer that uses Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to allow finer user control and dynamic adjustments, improving mastering performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mastering style transfer apply fixed processing, limiting user control and artistic refinement. The goal is to enable dynamic adjustments for more precise mastering results.

Method: The ITO-Master framework integrates ITO to optimize reference embeddings during inference, allowing micro-level adjustments. It explores black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors.

Result: ITO improves mastering performance across styles, validated through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis with CLAP embeddings.

Conclusion: ITO-Master offers an effective, user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, enabling refinement beyond initial style transfer.

Abstract: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering
characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the
professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed
processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the
results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the
ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that
integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over
the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference,
our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level
adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both
black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and
demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles.
Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative
analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that
ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability.
Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for
mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the
initial style transfer.

### [248] [Learnable-Differentiable Finite Volume Solver for Accelerated Simulation of Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01975)
*Mengtao Yan, Qi Wang, Haining Wang, Ruizhi Chengze, Yi Zhang, Hongsheng Liu, Zidong Wang, Fan Yu, Qi Qi, Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDSolver is a learnable, differentiable finite volume solver for efficient and accurate fluid flow simulation on coarse grids, outperforming baselines with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical solvers are computationally expensive, while machine learning methods lack interpretability and generalizability. LDSolver addresses these issues.

Method: Combines a differentiable finite volume solver with a learnable module for flux approximation and temporal error correction on coarse grids.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various flow systems with high accuracy and generalizability, even with minimal training data.

Conclusion: LDSolver offers an efficient, accurate, and generalizable solution for fluid flow simulation, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

*Siqing Long, Xiangzhi Huang, Jiemin Xie, Ming Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DKGCM, a graph convolutional network for accurate traffic demand forecasting by capturing spatiotemporal dependencies using DK-GCN (DTW and K-means) and FFT with bidirectional Mamba, enhanced by GRPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex spatiotemporal relationships in traffic systems limit forecasting accuracy, necessitating better models for resource allocation.

Method: Uses DK-GCN for spatial dependencies (DTW and K-means clustering) and FFT with bidirectional Mamba for temporal dependencies, optimized by GRPO reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods on three public datasets.

Conclusion: DKGCM effectively improves traffic demand forecasting accuracy by addressing spatiotemporal complexities.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores multimodal feature combinations (text, images, social features) for misinformation detection, showing improved performance over unimodal/bimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in research on multimodal misinformation detection by integrating text, images, and social features.

Method: Analyzed 1,529 tweets (text + images) using early fusion, data enrichment (OCR, object detection), and combined unsupervised/supervised ML.

Result: Multimodal models improved classification by 15% (vs. unimodal) and 5% (vs. bimodal). Analyzed misinformation propagation patterns.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches enhance misinformation detection, with social and visual features playing key roles.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

### [251] [Positive region preserved random sampling: an efficient feature selection method for massive data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01998)
*Hexiang Bai, Deyu Li, Jiye Liang, Yanhui Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new feature selection method for massive data using sampling and rough set theory, ensuring high discriminatory ability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent machines lack sufficient computing resources for feature selection in massive datasets, necessitating an efficient solution.

Method: Proposes a measure based on discernible object pairs and constructs positive region preserved samples to select feature subsets.

Result: Validated on 11 datasets, the method finds approximate reducts quickly with discriminatory ability exceeding estimated bounds.

Conclusion: The method efficiently selects high-discriminatory feature subsets for massive data, even on personal computers.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

*Bappaditya Dey, Daniel Sorensen, Minjin Hwang, Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing using image-based MTS analysis and Siamese networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like high data dimensionality, class imbalance, noise, and non-stationary behavior in semiconductor fabrication for better anomaly detection.

Method: Converts MTS data to image representations via Continuous Wavelet Transform, fine-tunes VGG-16 for classification, and uses a Siamese network for comparison.

Result: High accuracy in identifying anomalies on real FAB process data, suitable for offline detection.

Conclusion: The method is effective and flexible for both supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

*Anurag Arnab, Ahmet Iscen, Mathilde Caron, Alireza Fathi, Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Chain of Thought improves long-video understanding by iteratively selecting relevant frames for question-answering, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video understanding is challenging for VLMs due to irrelevant distractors and ineffective use of long context windows.

Method: Proposes Temporal Chain of Thought, where the VLM iteratively identifies and extracts relevant frames for answering questions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on 4 datasets, with notable gains on long videos (e.g., 2.8 points improvement on LVBench).

Conclusion: Leveraging inference-time computation for context selection enhances VLM performance, especially for long videos.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRES is a novel algorithm-system co-design solution for accelerating out-of-core SpGEMM in GCNs, addressing data alignment and memory bottlenecks, and achieving up to 1.8x lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for out-of-core SpGEMM in GCNs suffer from high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization due to sparse format data alignment and memory allocation issues.

Method: AIRES introduces block-level data alignment and a tiling algorithm for sparse matrices, along with a three-phase dynamic scheduling system using GPU memory, GDS, and host memory.

Result: AIRES outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing latency by up to 1.8x in real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: AIRES effectively addresses performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM for GCNs, offering significant improvements in latency and throughput.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: GeoAda is an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework for efficient fine-tuning of geometric diffusion models, preserving geometric consistency and avoiding overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently fine-tuning geometric diffusion models for downstream tasks with varying geometric controls is underexplored.

Method: GeoAda introduces a structured adapter design with control signal encoding, trainable copies of pretrained layers, and equivariant zero-initialized convolution.

Result: GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance while preserving original task accuracy, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: GeoAda is a versatile and effective solution for controlled generative tasks in geometric diffusion models.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks LLMs against a proprietary hiring model (Match Score), showing Match Score's superior accuracy and fairness in job candidate matching, while cautioning against off-the-shelf LLMs due to bias risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about accuracy and algorithmic bias in using LLMs for hiring, and to demonstrate the advantages of domain-specific models over general-purpose LLMs.

Method: Benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against Match Score using predictive accuracy (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness metrics (impact ratio across gender, race, and intersectional subgroups) on 10,000 real-world candidate-job pairs.

Result: Match Score outperformed LLMs in accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and fairness (minimum race-wise impact ratio 0.957 vs 0.809 or lower for LLMs).

Conclusion: Domain-specific models like Match Score can achieve both accuracy and fairness in hiring, unlike off-the-shelf LLMs, which risk propagating biases without safeguards.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fault diagnosis in induction machines by exploring the potential of Pad√© Approximant Neural Networks (Pad√©Nets) over traditional models like CNNs and Self-ONNs.

Method: Comparison of CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad√©Nets on vibration and acoustic datasets from induction motors, focusing on nonlinearity and unbounded activation functions.

Result: Pad√©Nets achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33% across different sensors, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: Pad√©Nets' enhanced nonlinearity and compatibility with unbounded activation functions significantly improve fault diagnosis in motor condition monitoring.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), a new model class that learns to think and verify predictions solely through unsupervised learning, outperforming existing methods in scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize System 2 Thinking approaches without modality or problem-specific constraints, and enable models to learn verification and prediction solely from unsupervised learning.

Method: Train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) to assign energy values to input-prediction pairs, enabling predictions via gradient descent-based energy minimization.

Result: EBTs scale faster (35% higher rate) and outperform Transformer++ (29% better on language tasks) and Diffusion Transformers (fewer passes for image denoising). They generalize better on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: EBTs are a promising paradigm for enhancing model learning and thinking capabilities, offering superior scalability and performance.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

*Francesco Di Salvo, Hanh Huyen My Nguyen, Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using Differentially Private (DP) generative models for decentralized medical imaging data sharing, improving privacy, scalability, and efficiency over traditional Federated Learning (FL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and privacy constraints in medical imaging by leveraging federated learning while reducing communication costs and enhancing flexibility for diverse tasks.

Method: Propose a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) trained collaboratively by clients to model a global, privacy-aware data distribution, using foundation models for compact embeddings.

Result: Outperforms traditional FL classifiers, ensures differential privacy, and produces higher-fidelity embeddings with fewer parameters compared to DP-CGAN.

Conclusion: The DP-CVAE approach enhances privacy, scalability, and efficiency in medical imaging, supporting diverse downstream tasks while addressing data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

### [262] [Scaling Collapse Reveals Universal Dynamics in Compute-Optimally Trained Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02119)
*Shikai Qiu, Lechao Xiao, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Jeffrey Pennington, Atish Agarwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compute-optimally trained neural models exhibit universal loss curve collapse when normalized, termed 'supercollapse', indicating good scaling and optimal hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the scaling limits and universality in neural network training dynamics as model size and training time grow together.

Method: Analyze loss curves of models of varying sizes, normalize training compute and loss, and observe collapse under optimal hyperparameters. Connect collapse to power-law scaling laws and model SGD noise dynamics.

Result: Supercollapse occurs across architectures, datasets, and learning rate schedules when hyperparameters are scaled optimally, breaking down otherwise.

Conclusion: Supercollapse serves as a precise indicator of optimal scaling, explained by power-law scaling laws and SGD noise dynamics.

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CROP is an LLM-powered framework for automatic VLSI design flow tuning, improving efficiency and QoR by leveraging dense vector representations, embedding-based retrieval, and RAG-enhanced LLM-guided search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual parameter selection in VLSI design is laborious and limited by expertise; CROP automates this using LLMs to optimize the process.

Method: CROP transforms RTL code into dense vectors, uses embedding-based retrieval for similar circuits, and employs RAG-enhanced LLM-guided parameter search.

Result: CROP achieves better QoR with fewer iterations, reducing power consumption by 9.9% in industrial designs.

Conclusion: CROP demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in automating and optimizing VLSI design flow tuning.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

*Xiao Li, Liangji Zhu, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a latent diffusion framework combining a VAE and conditional diffusion model for efficient data compression, achieving high compression ratios and better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models lack controllability and reconstruction accuracy for practical data compression applications.

Method: Uses a VAE and conditional diffusion model to compress keyframes into latent space, reconstructing remaining frames via generative interpolation.

Result: Achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios than SZ3 and 63% better performance than learning-based methods under the same error.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap in generative models for practical compression, offering high accuracy and reduced storage costs.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

*Tuo Wang, Jian Kang, Yujun Yan, Adithya Kulkarni, Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCPNET introduces a conformal prediction framework for temporal graphs, addressing limitations of static methods by incorporating temporal dependencies and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods for GNNs focus on static graphs, ignoring temporal dependencies, which limits their real-world applicability.

Method: NCPNET uses a diffusion-based non-conformity score to capture topological and temporal uncertainties and an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show NCPNET ensures guaranteed coverage, reduces prediction set size by up to 31%, and improves efficiency.

Conclusion: NCPNET effectively extends conformal prediction to dynamic graphs, enhancing reliability and efficiency in temporal settings.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal validation procedure to ensure machine learning models account for how individuals can change their inputs, addressing safety failures in applications like lending, hiring, and content moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety failures in ML models arise when predictions ignore how individuals can alter their inputs, leading to unfair or harmful outcomes in critical applications.

Method: The authors propose a validation procedure for responsiveness, treating it as sensitivity analysis. They estimate responsiveness using black-box access and develop algorithms to sample reachable points.

Result: The method supports tasks like falsification and failure probability estimation, demonstrated in applications such as recidivism prediction and organ transplant prioritization.

Conclusion: The proposed procedure enhances model safety by ensuring predictions account for user interventions, with practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

*Jiyeon Bae, Hyeon Jeon, Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A workflow to reduce bias in evaluating dimensionality reduction (DR) projections by clustering correlated metrics and selecting representatives from each cluster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR evaluation metrics can be biased if highly correlated metrics are selected, favoring techniques that emphasize specific structural characteristics.

Method: Proposes a workflow to cluster metrics based on empirical correlations, minimize overlap, and select representative metrics from each cluster.

Result: Quantitative experiments show improved stability in DR evaluation, indicating reduced bias.

Conclusion: The workflow effectively mitigates evaluation bias in DR projections by optimizing metric selection.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

*Xinquan Huang, Paris Perdikaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect is a training-free framework that corrects neural network predictions for PDEs by enforcing PDE consistency, reducing errors by up to 100x with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks for PDEs suffer from error accumulation during long-term predictions, leading to divergence from valid solutions.

Method: PhysicsCorrect formulates correction as a linearized inverse problem using PDE residuals, with an efficient caching strategy for Jacobian precomputation.

Result: The framework reduces prediction errors by up to 100x across Navier-Stokes, wave equations, and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems, adding under 5% inference time.

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect transforms unstable neural surrogates into reliable tools, balancing computational efficiency and physical fidelity.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

TL;DR: VERBA uses LLMs to automate pairwise model comparisons, improving transparency and comparability in ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of manually comparing numerous ML models due to the prohibitive O(N^2) pairwise comparisons.

Method: Leverages LLMs to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from pairs, evaluated via simulation.

Result: Achieves 80% accuracy in verbalizing differences; improves to 90% with structural information.

Conclusion: VERBA enhances model transparency and comparability, enabling better model selection.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

*Fangzhou Shi, Xiaopeng Ke, Xinye Xiong, Kexin Meng, Chang Men, Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy for ride-hailing platforms, integrating Fast Competition Adaptation and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment to optimize coupon strategies under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competitive ranking mechanism on ride-hailing platforms incentivizes lower fares, creating a need for dynamic coupon strategies to optimize order acquisition while adhering to budget constraints.

Method: The authors introduce FCA-RL, combining Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) for dynamic price response and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA) for budget adherence, along with RideGym, a simulation environment for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show FCA-RL outperforms baseline methods in diverse market conditions, proving its effectiveness in subsidy optimization.

Conclusion: FCA-RL offers a robust solution for ride-hailing providers to dynamically adapt pricing strategies, ensuring competitiveness and sustainability.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in reward function design include inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and suboptimal performance of existing methods like LLMs and evolutionary search.

Method: URDP uses self-consistency analysis for uncertainty quantification, uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization (UABO), and a bi-level optimization architecture.

Result: URDP outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality reward functions and improving efficiency across 35 diverse tasks.

Conclusion: URDP effectively combines LLMs and Bayesian optimization, offering a superior solution for automated reward design in RL.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: A knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication (KGZS-SC) network is proposed to improve interpretability and generalization in semantic communication, especially for unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability and generalization in data-driven semantic communication, particularly for unseen data applications.

Method: Utilizes a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB) to align semantic features and enable reasoning for unseen cases, combined with zero-shot learning (ZSL) for classification without retraining.

Result: The KGZS-SC network shows robust generalization and outperforms existing frameworks in classifying unseen categories across various SNR levels.

Conclusion: The proposed KGZS-SC network enhances adaptability and efficiency in dynamic or resource-constrained environments by leveraging structured semantic information and zero-shot learning.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

*Alif Ashrafee, Jedrzej Kozal, Michal Wozniak, Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR) for continual learning under concept drift, outperforming Full Relearning (FR) with less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift alters data distributions, requiring both stability and adaptation.

Method: Proposes AMR, a lightweight method that updates the replay buffer by removing outdated samples and adding current ones, reducing annotation and computational needs.

Result: AMR matches FR's performance while significantly reducing labeled data and computation requirements.

Conclusion: AMR is a scalable solution for non-stationary continual learning, balancing stability and plasticity.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Motivation: Challenges in learning arise when target distributions in constrained generation are unlikely under the base model, due to sparse rewards.

language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To summarize the latest advancements and applications of Transformer models in EEG decoding for BCIs/BMIs.

Method: Review and organize research on Transformer architectures, including hybrid models and customized structures, for EEG processing.

Result: Identifies key benefits of Transformers in EEG decoding and highlights current hybrid and modified architectures.

Conclusion: Transformers show promise in EEG decoding, but challenges remain; future research directions are suggested.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

### [276] [DeltaSHAP: Explaining Prediction Evolutions in Online Patient Monitoring with Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02342)
*Changhun Kim, Yechan Mun, Sangchul Hahn, Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeltaSHAP is a new XAI algorithm for online patient monitoring, addressing clinical needs by explaining prediction changes, feature attributions, and real-time insights, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods lack suitability for clinical time series explanation, necessitating a solution for timely intervention in patient risk evolution.

Method: DeltaSHAP adapts Shapley values for temporal settings, focusing on observed feature combinations for efficient, real-time explanations.

Result: DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI methods by 62% in explanation quality and reduces computation time by 33%.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP is effective for clinical time series, offering practical, real-time explanations for patient monitoring.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code
at https://github.com/AITRICS/DeltaSHAP.

*Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan, Zhaocong Yuan, Shaojie Zhuo, Chen Feng, Yicheng Lin, Chenzheng Su, Xiaopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft is a unified framework enabling a single draft model to work with any target model, addressing cross-vocabulary mismatches and improving decoding speed via adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in online deployment include draft-target model incompatibility and latency expectations. OmniDraft aims to solve these for on-device LLM applications.

Method: Uses an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning and adaptive drafting techniques.

Result: OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models, achieving 1.5-2x speedup.

Conclusion: OmniDraft supports the 'one drafter for all' paradigm, proving effective for math, coding, and text generation tasks.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

### [278] [Offline Reinforcement Learning with Penalized Action Noise Injection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02356)
*JunHyeok Oh, Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANI is a simple yet effective method for improving offline RL by injecting noise into actions and penalizing the noise, inspired by diffusion models but without their computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of diffusion models in offline RL while maintaining high performance.

Method: Proposes Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), which injects noise into actions and penalizes the noise amount, theoretically linking it to a modified MDP.

Result: PANI significantly improves performance across benchmarks and is compatible with existing offline RL algorithms.

Conclusion: PANI offers a computationally efficient alternative to diffusion models for enhancing offline RL performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for equalizer parameter optimization in DRAM systems are computationally demanding or rely on explicit models, necessitating a more efficient and model-free approach.

Method: The paper employs learned latent signal representations for fast signal integrity evaluation and a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent for parameter optimization.

Result: The method improved eye-opening window area by 42.7% for cascaded CTLE-DFE structures and 36.8% for DFE-only configurations, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The framework offers superior performance, computational efficiency, and generalization, with key contributions in latent signal metrics and model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

*Caio Azevedo, Lina Achaji, Stefano Sabatini, Nicola Poerio, Grzegorz Bartyzel, Sascha Hornauer, Fabien Moutarde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning trajectory prediction models using preference optimization to improve scene consistency in multi-agent settings without sacrificing accuracy or adding computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models lack consistency in capturing interdependencies between agents in complex scenarios, leading to potentially dangerous situations for autonomous vehicles.

Method: The work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models by incorporating automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures during the fine-tuning process.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show significant improvement in scene consistency with minimal loss in trajectory prediction accuracy and no added computational cost at inference.

Conclusion: Preference optimization effectively enhances the consistency of trajectory predictions in multi-agent scenarios, addressing a critical limitation of current models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

*Ruiyang Zhou, Shuozhe Li, Amy Zhang, Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExPO, a new RL post-training method, improves reasoning by generating self-explanatory samples aligned with the model's policy, outperforming expert-based methods in challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-style post-training methods rely on initial model outputs, limiting their ability to solve problems where the model initially fails. Effective exploration requires positive samples that align with the model's policy and improve correctness.

Method: ExPO generates self-explanatory samples by conditioning on ground-truth answers, ensuring alignment with the model's policy and higher quality than incorrect samples.

Result: ExPO enhances learning efficiency and performance, especially in challenging tasks like MATH level-5, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods.

Conclusion: ExPO provides a modular and effective solution for improving reasoning in RL post-training, particularly in settings where initial model performance is weak.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

*Zihan Tan, Suyuan Huang, Guancheng Wan, Wenke Huang, He Li, Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2FGL addresses spatial and spectral challenges in Federated Graph Learning by combining a global knowledge repository and frequency alignment, improving global GNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subgraph-FL methods neglect signal propagation in spatial and spectral domains, leading to degraded global GNN performance and client drifts.

Method: Proposes S2FGL, integrating a global knowledge repository for spatial label signal disruption and frequency alignment for spectral heterogeneity.

Result: S2FGL outperforms existing methods on multiple datasets, demonstrating improved global generalizability.

Conclusion: S2FGL effectively mitigates spatial and spectral challenges in Federated Graph Learning, enhancing GNN performance.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

### [283] [Variational Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02466)
*Francesco Alesiani, Henrik Christiansen, Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfinityKAN adaptively learns infinite bases for univariate functions in KANs, addressing ad-hoc hyperparameter choices via variational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical foundations of KANs are powerful, but their practical use depends on arbitrary choices of bases for univariate functions.

Method: InfinityKAN uses variational inference and backpropagation to learn bases adaptively during training.

Result: The approach extends KANs' applicability by integrating hyperparameter learning into the training process.

Conclusion: InfinityKAN enhances KANs by eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter tuning, making them more practical for representation learning.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

### [284] [Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02496)
*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online framework for conformal prediction, optimizing interval efficiency while maintaining coverage. It contrasts performance between exchangeable and arbitrary input sequences, showing a gap and proposing a matching algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of constructing efficient confidence intervals in an online setting, balancing coverage and interval length.

Method: The method involves analyzing and designing algorithms for online conformal prediction, comparing performance on exchangeable and arbitrary sequences.

Result: For exchangeable sequences, near-optimal coverage and length are achieved. For arbitrary sequences, a tradeoff between length and mistakes is shown, with a matching algorithm provided.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a gap between exchangeable and arbitrary settings, proposes a Pareto-optimal algorithm, and demonstrates its robustness.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) improves continual learning in LLMs by combining full and low-rank parameters, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness in continual fine-tuning of LLMs, overcoming LoRA's limitations.

Method: Synergistically combines full and low-rank parameters, updating them jointly in a low-rank gradient subspace.

Result: Superior performance on continual learning benchmarks, mitigating catastrophic forgetting while preserving efficiency.

Conclusion: GORP effectively balances efficiency and expressiveness, advancing continual learning for LLMs.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach enhances cross-subject motor imagery classification using optimized preprocessing and deep learning, achieving superior accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of variability in EEG patterns across individuals, which hinders calibration-free BCIs for real-world use.

Method: Uses STFT-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and balanced batching with a CNN, validated across four datasets.

Result: Achieves 67.60% on IV-1, 65.96% on IV-2A, and 80.22% on IV-2B, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification and contributes a robust open-access dataset.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

TL;DR: RetrySQL introduces a self-correcting approach for text-to-SQL models, using corrupted and corrected reasoning steps to improve accuracy by up to 4 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of SQL-specific generative models and unexplored potential of self-correcting strategies in text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: Corrupts reference SQL queries to create retry data, pre-trains an open-source coding model with this data, and evaluates full-parameter pre-training vs. LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Improves execution accuracy by up to 4 percentage points; full-parameter pre-training is essential for learning self-correction.

Conclusion: RetrySQL successfully learns self-correction, enhancing SQL generation accuracy and competing with larger proprietary models.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs succeed due to exploiting compositional sparsity in target functions, a property shared by efficiently computable functions, though key questions on learnability and optimization remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why overparametrized DNNs excel in high-dimensional tasks, focusing on their ability to exploit compositional sparsity in functions.

Method: Argues that DNNs leverage compositional sparsity, where functions are built from low-dimensional constituent functions, a property common in computable functions.

Result: DNNs' success is tied to compositional sparsity, but gaps remain in understanding learnability and optimization.

Conclusion: Understanding compositional sparsity is crucial for a complete theory of deep learning and intelligence.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni, Galvin Khara, Joachim Schaeffer, Marat Subkhankulov, Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Removing layer-wise normalization (LN) from GPT-2 models has minimal impact on performance, enabling better interpretability without significant loss in language modeling quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of LN layers in inference and improve mechanistic interpretability of transformer models.

Method: Remove all LN layers from GPT-2 models, fine-tune, and evaluate validation loss and interpretability techniques.

Result: LN removal causes only a small increase in validation loss (e.g., +0.03 for GPT-2 XL). Interpretability improves, but attribution patching accuracy remains unchanged.

Conclusion: LN layers are not essential for GPT-2-class models, and their removal aids interpretability research.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends DBNs with a scalable trainable interconnect and introduces two pruning stages for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the scalability and efficiency of DBNs while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Extends DBNs with a trainable interconnect and proposes two pruning stages: SAT-based logic equivalence and similarity-based data-driven pruning.

Result: Achieves scalable DBNs with improved accuracy and superior compression-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The approach enables wider DBN layers and efficient model size reduction without performance loss.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

*Fran√ßois Rozet, Ruben Ohana, Michael McCabe, Gilles Louppe, Fran√ßois Lanusse, Shirley Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent-space diffusion models for dynamical system emulation are robust to high compression (up to 1000x) and outperform non-generative methods in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational cost of diffusion models in physics emulation by leveraging latent-space generation, inspired by image/video generation.

Method: Using latent-space diffusion models for dynamical system emulation, testing robustness to compression and comparing with non-generative methods.

Result: Latent-space emulation remains accurate even at high compression (1000x), with diffusion models outperforming non-generative counterparts in accuracy and diversity.

Conclusion: Latent-space diffusion models are effective for dynamical system emulation, offering accuracy and diversity, with practical design choices being crucial for training.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

### [292] [L-VAE: Variational Auto-Encoder with Learnable Beta for Disentangled Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02619)
*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan, Sinan Kalkan, Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE is a novel model that learns disentangled representations and hyperparameters of the cost function, improving upon Œ≤-VAE by dynamically balancing reconstruction and disentanglement losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of Œ≤-VAE, where hyperparameters are manually adjusted, by proposing a learnable approach to optimize the trade-off between reconstruction and disentanglement.

Method: L-VAE learns the weights of loss terms and model parameters simultaneously, adding a regularization term to avoid bias. It is evaluated against several VAE variants on multiple datasets.

Result: L-VAE achieves top or near-top performance in disentanglement metrics across datasets and successfully disentangles facial attributes in qualitative tests on CelebA.

Conclusion: L-VAE effectively balances reconstruction and disentanglement, outperforming or matching existing methods, demonstrating its robustness and versatility.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, using fewer parameters and computation. Incorporating AlphaFold structures further improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VEPs rely on MSAs, which may not account for low evolutionary pressure in pharmacogenes. DMS datasets offer an alternative with quantitative fitness scores.

Method: Proposed matVAE with a structured prior, evaluated on 33 DMS datasets from ProteinGym. Compared matVAE-MSA (trained on MSAs) and matENC-DMS (trained on DMS data).

Result: matVAE-MSA outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot prediction. matENC-DMS excels in supervised tasks. AlphaFold integration boosts performance.

Conclusion: DMS datasets can replace MSAs without significant performance loss, encouraging further development and exploration of DMS datasets for variant effect prediction.

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

*Irena Girshovitz, Atai Ambus, Moni Shahar, Ran Gilad-Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Medical Data Pecking approach, adapting software engineering concepts to assess EHR data quality, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying issues across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data quality issues like biases and errors hinder reliable research and AI training, necessitating better assessment methods.

Method: The Medical Data Pecking Tool (MDPT) uses automated test generation (via LLMs) and a testing framework to evaluate data quality.

Result: MDPT identified 20-43 data issues in three datasets, validating its effectiveness in detecting non-aligned or non-conforming data.

Conclusion: The approach enhances data quality testing by integrating medical knowledge, improving research validity, and enabling future advancements.

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

### [295] [High-Order Deep Meta-Learning with Category-Theoretic Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02634)
*David H. Mguni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical deep learning framework for meta-learning generates virtual tasks to learn generalizable rules, enhancing inductive biases and enabling autonomous task creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on human-generated data and enable neural networks to generalize across hierarchies of tasks by generating synthetic problem instances.

Method: Uses a generative mechanism to create virtual tasks, iteratively refining constraints through exploration and leveraging category-theoretic functors for abstraction and knowledge transfer.

Result: Produces novel tasks and constraints, regularizes adaptation, and supports structured, interpretable learning progression.

Conclusion: This framework advances meta-learning towards general AI by enabling autonomous task generation and hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

*Alberto Caron, Chris Hicks, Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by targeting epistemic uncertainty with intrinsic motivation bonuses, backed by theoretical guarantees and practical approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning, particularly in environments with sparse rewards or purely exploratory tasks.

Method: Uses information-theoretic exploration bonuses for epistemic uncertainty, integrates model-based planning with these bonuses in the PTS-BE framework, and employs approximations like sparse variational Gaussian Processes.

Result: PTS-BE outperforms baselines in environments with sparse rewards or exploratory tasks, demonstrating sample-efficient deep exploration.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical grounding for IG-based approaches and a practical framework (PTS-BE) for effective exploration in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAID improves deepfake detection by addressing fairness and generalization via causal analysis, data rebalancing, and feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflict between fairness and generalization in deepfake detection by uncovering their causal relationship.

Method: Proposes DAID with demographic-aware data rebalancing and demographic-agnostic feature aggregation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in fairness and generalization across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAID successfully balances fairness and generalization, validated by theoretical and practical results.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

*Siqi Zhao, Joshua Moller, Porfi Quintero-Cadena, Lood van Niekerk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A guided discrete diffusion model (SVDD) is introduced to optimize antibody sequences for developability, combining natural sequence data and clinical-stage antibody measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve antibody developability (manufacturability, stability, safety) using computational methods for clinical effectiveness.

Method: Uses a guided discrete diffusion model trained on natural antibody sequences (OAS) and developability data, integrating a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module.

Result: The model reproduces natural repertoire features and enriches developability scores under SVDD guidance.

Conclusion: The framework enables ML-driven antibody design, balancing binding and biophysical criteria.

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

*Thomas Hazenberg, Yao Ma, Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari, Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARL improves dynamic pricing in supply chains by modeling strategic interactions, outperforming static rule-based methods. MADDPG balances competition and fairness best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERP systems use static pricing, ignoring strategic interactions. MARL addresses this gap for more realistic supply chain dynamics.

Method: Evaluated MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static baselines in a simulated e-commerce environment with LightGBM demand prediction.

Result: Rule-based methods excel in fairness and stability but lack competition. MADDPG balances competition (9.5 pp volatility) and fairness (0.8819). MADQN is aggressive but less fair.

Conclusion: MARL captures emergent strategic behavior, offering a promising direction for dynamic pricing in supply chains.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consensus-based protocol (FedVRD) for federated learning to reduce wasteful data transfer by selecting clients with the most useful model weights, outperforming traditional methods like FedAvg and addressing adversarial vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize wasteful data transfer costs in federated learning by identifying and utilizing only the most useful client weights, while also addressing adversarial weaknesses in existing protocols.

Method: The study explores fluid democracy protocols for FL, introduces a new protocol (viscous-retained democracy), and proposes FedVRD to dynamically limit adversarial impact while optimizing costs.

Result: The proposed viscous-retained democracy protocol outperforms traditional 1p1v (FedAvg) and FedVRD effectively mitigates adversarial influence while minimizing costs.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel approach to improve efficiency and security in federated learning by leveraging consensus-based protocols and dynamic adversarial mitigation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

TL;DR: FoG is a deep RL algorithm inspired by human infantile amnesia, introducing Experience Replay Decay and Network Expansion to improve sample efficiency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address primacy bias in deep RL, where early experiences overfit, limiting efficiency and generalizability.

Method: FoG uses Experience Replay Decay to forget early experiences and Network Expansion to grow neural capacity dynamically.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms like BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2 on 40+ continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: FoG effectively mitigates primacy bias, enhancing RL performance through biologically inspired mechanisms.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate demand prediction is crucial for managing dockless e-scooters, which enhance urban transport but require optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning.

Method: The study introduces a framework combining spatial, temporal, and network dependencies for micromobility demand forecasting.

Result: The framework outperforms baseline models, improving prediction accuracy by 27 to 49%.

Conclusion: The findings enable data-driven micromobility management, optimizing fleet distribution and supporting sustainable urban planning.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge heterogeneous biological data modalities and improve PPI prediction by leveraging hierarchical protein attributes and contrastive learning.

Method: Uses hierarchical contrastive loss functions and data-driven penalties to align protein sequences and hierarchical attributes, ensuring consistency with protein function hierarchies.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, shows robustness in low-data regimes, and demonstrates zero-shot transferability to other species.

Conclusion: HIPPO advances cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for sparse or imbalanced multi-species data scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

TL;DR: A novel entropy-based method for classification by searching for optimal parameters in a bounded hypercube, extending to polynomial surfaces for complex boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of separating two classes using hyperplanes is central to machine learning, but traditional methods like SVMs and gradient descent have limitations. This paper aims to provide a robust alternative.

Method: Proposes minimizing an entropy-based function to find parameters in a bounded hypercube and a positive vector, extending to polynomial surfaces for non-linear boundaries.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method's efficiency and versatility in handling both linear and non-linear classification tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust alternative to traditional techniques, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse classification scenarios.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large language models face inefficiencies due to reliance on massive datasets, necessitating architectures that prioritize token efficiency.

Method: The study introduces the 2-simplicial Transformer, which generalizes dot-product attention to trilinear functions using an efficient Triton kernel.

Result: The 2-simplicial Transformer outperforms standard Transformers in tasks like math and reasoning under fixed token budgets, altering scaling law exponents.

Conclusion: The 2-simplicial Transformer offers a promising approach for improving token efficiency in large language models.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

*Yixuan Zhang, Ruihao Zhu, Qiaomin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies contextual online pricing with biased offline data, identifying key factors like bias, data size, and dispersion affecting regret bounds. It proposes OFU policies for optimal performance and extends results to stochastic linear bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of contextual pricing with biased offline data, aiming to derive tight regret guarantees and optimal algorithms.

Method: Uses Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) policies for scalar and general price elasticity cases, and designs a robust variant for unknown bias.

Result: Achieves minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bounds for scalar elasticity and worst-case rates for general elasticity, improving on purely online methods.

Conclusion: The work provides the first tight regret guarantees for contextual pricing with biased offline data, with techniques applicable to stochastic linear bandits.

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

### [307] [Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Recurrent Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02782)
*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz, Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why recurrent models fail to generalize to longer sequences and proposes simple training interventions to improve length generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent models like state space models and linear attention struggle with length generalization beyond their training context lengths, limiting their practical utility.

Method: The authors empirically and theoretically analyze the 'unexplored states hypothesis' and test training interventions like Gaussian noise initialization or using final states from other sequences.

Result: With minimal post-training steps (‚àº0.1% of pre-training budget), these interventions enable models to generalize to sequences orders of magnitude longer than training context (e.g., 2k‚Üí128k).

Conclusion: Simple training interventions can efficiently enhance length generalization in recurrent models, making them more robust for long-context tasks.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

*Thiti Suttaket, Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRADUATE is a survival analysis model ensuring calibration for all subpopulations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival models are poorly calibrated for minority subpopulations, risking erroneous clinical decisions.

Method: GRADUATE frames multicalibration as constrained optimization, balancing calibration and discrimination.

Result: Empirical results show GRADUATE outperforms baselines, with theoretical guarantees of near-optimality.

Conclusion: GRADUATE effectively addresses calibration issues in survival analysis, benefiting diverse subpopulations.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

It introduces new replicable algorithms and lower bound techniques, addressing open questions in uniformity and closeness testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore distribution testing within algorithmic replicability, aiming to understand sample complexity for testing key properties of distributions.

Method: Develops new replicable algorithms for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions and introduces a methodology for proving sample complexity lower bounds.

Result: Presents near-optimal sample complexity lower bounds for replicable uniformity and closeness testing, addressing prior open questions.

Conclusion: The study advances replicable distribution testing by providing algorithmic solutions and lower bound techniques, with implications for future research.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

### [310] [LLM-Driven Treatment Effect Estimation Under Inference Time Text Confounding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02843)
*Yuchen Ma, Dennis Frauen, Jonas Schweisthal, Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in treatment effect estimation due to incomplete textual data at inference time, proposing a framework combining large language models and a doubly robust learner to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between structured training data and incomplete textual inference data can bias treatment effect estimates, impacting personalized medicine.

Method: A novel framework using large language models and a custom doubly robust learner to account for inference time text confounding.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates bias from inference time text confounding, improving treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

*Kunyu Zhang, Qiang Li, Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MvHo-IB is a multi-view learning framework for fMRI data that models higher-order interactions (HOIs) to improve diagnostic accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher-order interactions (HOIs) in fMRI data can enhance diagnostic accuracy, but extracting and utilizing them is challenging.

Method: MvHo-IB integrates pairwise and HOIs using O-information and Renyi entropy, a Brain3DCNN encoder, and a multi-view learning information bottleneck.

Result: MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance on three fMRI datasets, surpassing hypergraph-based methods.

Conclusion: MvHo-IB effectively models HOIs for improved diagnostic decision-making in fMRI analysis.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

### [312] [Bypass Back-propagation: Optimization-based Structural Pruning for Large Language Models via Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10576)
*Yuan Gao, Zujing Liu, Weizhong Zhang, Bo Du, Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an optimization-based structural pruning method for LLMs that learns pruning masks in a probabilistic space, avoiding back-propagation and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods rely on heuristic metrics, leading to suboptimal performance. This work aims to optimize pruning directly by minimizing the loss of the pruned model.

Method: Learns Bernoulli distributions to sample binary pruning masks, decoupling parameters from LLM loss for efficient optimization via policy gradient. Avoids back-propagation through LLM.

Result: Demonstrates promising performance on models like LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and Mistral, supporting global and heterogeneous pruning.

Conclusion: The method is efficient and effective, offering a novel approach to LLM pruning without expensive finetuning.

Abstract: Recent Large-Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods typically operate at the
post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their
pruning criteria often rely on heuristically hand-crafted metrics, potentially
leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel
optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a
probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To
preserve efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM
per se during optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We
achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary
pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from LLM loss,
facilitating efficient optimization via policy gradient estimator without
back-propagation. Thus, our method can 1) support global and heterogeneous
pruning (i.e., automatically determine different redundancy for different
layers), and 2) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our
Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments conducted on LLaMA, LLaMA-2,
LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral models using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets
demonstrate the promising performance of our method in efficiency and
effectiveness. Code is available at

### [313] [On Characterizations for Language Generation: Interplay of Hallucinations, Breadth, and Stability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18530)
*Alkis Kalavasis, Anay Mehrotra, Grigoris Velegkas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies language generation in the limit, characterizing notions of breadth and proving lower bounds for stable generators, highlighting trade-offs between breadth, stability, and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing language generation algorithms, particularly their lack of coverage or breadth, and to explore the interplay between breadth, stability, and consistency in generation.

Method: Characterizes generation for existing notions of breadth and their extensions, proves lower bounds for stable generators, and compares performance metrics like perplexity and hallucination rates.

Result: Settles open questions about breadth in generation, shows impossibility of certain performance improvements, and demonstrates the increased difficulty of stable generation with breadth.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive understanding of breadth in language generation, reveals fundamental trade-offs, and separates stable and unstable generators in terms of achievable breadth.

Abstract: We study language generation in the limit - introduced by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [KM24] - building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin
[Ang79]. [KM24]'s main result is an algorithm for generating from any countable
language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually generates
unseen strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices coverage or breadth,
i.e., its ability to generate a rich set of strings. Recent work introduces
different notions of breadth and explores when generation with breadth is
possible, leaving a full characterization of these notions open. Our first set
of results settles this by characterizing generation for existing notions of
breadth and their natural extensions. Interestingly, our lower bounds are very
flexible and hold for many performance metrics beyond breadth - for instance,
showing that, in general, it is impossible to train generators which achieve a
higher perplexity or lower hallucination rate for $K$ compared to other
languages. Next, we study language generation with breadth and stable
generators - algorithms that eventually stop changing after seeing an arbitrary
but finite number of strings - and prove unconditional lower bounds for such
generators, strengthening the results of [KMV25] and demonstrating that
generation with many existing notions of breadth becomes equally hard, when
stability is required. This gives a separation for generation with approximate
breadth, between stable and unstable generators, highlighting the rich
interplay between breadth, stability, and consistency in language generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for interpretable fine-tuning to analyze learning dynamics in models, using node-level intrinsic dimensionality and a two-stage algorithm called circuit-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the learning dynamics inside models, which remain understudied compared to static mechanisms.

Method: Proposes circuit-tuning, a two-stage algorithm involving iterative subgraph building and heuristic parameter updates.

Result: Confirms node-level intrinsic dimensionality and demonstrates effective transparent fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Provides insights into neural network self-organization during learning through visualized circuits.

Abstract: The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer a model to
explain its behaviors. While recent studies have focused on the static
mechanism of a certain behavior, the learning dynamics inside a model remain to
be explored. In this work, we develop an interpretable fine-tuning method for
analyzing the mechanism behind learning. We first introduce the concept of
node-level intrinsic dimensionality to describe the learning process of a model
in a computational graph. Based on our theory, we propose circuit-tuning, a
two-stage algorithm that iteratively builds the minimal subgraph for a specific
task and updates the key parameters in a heuristic way. Experimental results
confirm the existence of the intrinsic dimensionality at the node level and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for transparent and interpretable
fine-tuning. We visualize and analyze the circuits before, during, and after
fine-tuning, providing new insights into the self-organization mechanism of a
neural network in the learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IRO is a reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs without modifying model parameters, using iterative resampling and lightweight value functions for test-time guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods like RLHF and DPO require model fine-tuning, limiting their use when weights are inaccessible or during test-time. Test-time methods are costly and rely on imperfect reward functions.

Method: IRO iteratively samples candidates, resamples using value functions, and trains lightweight value functions to guide generation without updating base model weights.

Result: IRO enables alignment without weight updates, reducing inference costs and improving output quality compared to one-shot test-time methods.

Conclusion: IRO offers a flexible, efficient alternative to traditional alignment methods, applicable even without model weight access.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

TL;DR: GPAS is a technique to mitigate activation variance growth in Pre-LN Transformers by scaling down activations while preserving gradients, improving performance across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformers suffer from exponential activation variance growth, limiting deeper layer learning. GPAS addresses this without gradient issues.

Method: GPAS scales intermediate activations while keeping gradients unchanged, preserving information and avoiding gradient vanishing.

Result: GPAS consistently improves performance in models from 71M to 1B and works with other architectures like Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm.

Conclusion: GPAS is a versatile solution for improving training dynamics in Pre-LN and other Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the shortcut to dominate over sub-layer outputs in the residual
connection and limiting the learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple
technique that can be used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works
by scaling down the intermediate activations while keeping their gradients
unchanged. This leaves information in the activations intact, and avoids the
gradient vanishing problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive
experiments across various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves
consistent performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also
shows promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SPRO is a novel framework for process-aware RL in LLMs, eliminating the need for additional reward models and improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational overhead and lack of theoretical framework for process-level advantage estimation in PRL.

Method: SPRO derives process rewards intrinsically from the policy model and introduces cumulative process rewards and Masked Step Advantage (MSA).

Result: SPRO outperforms GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency, 17.5% test accuracy improvement, and reduced response length.

Conclusion: SPRO offers a computationally efficient, stable, and effective solution for process-aware RL in LLMs.

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential
in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KD-BIRL, a Bayesian IRL method that leverages training task data to improve reward function inference, especially with limited expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian IRL often requires large datasets, which are impractical in domains like clinical data. The goal is to enhance inference using existing domain-specific data.

Method: KD-BIRL uses a conditional kernel density estimator to incorporate known reward functions from training tasks, improving likelihood estimation.

Result: KD-BIRL shows faster posterior concentration rates than baselines, especially with limited test task demonstrations, and provides theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: KD-BIRL offers a principled, theoretically grounded framework for Bayesian IRL, making it viable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods infer an agent's reward function
using demonstrations of expert behavior. A Bayesian IRL approach models a
distribution over candidate reward functions, capturing a degree of uncertainty
in the inferred reward function. This is critical in some applications, such as
those involving clinical data. Typically, Bayesian IRL algorithms require large
demonstration datasets, which may not be available in practice. In this work,
we incorporate existing domain-specific data to achieve better posterior
concentration rates. We study a common setting in clinical and biological
applications where we have access to expert demonstrations and known reward
functions for a set of training tasks. Our aim is to learn the reward function
of a new test task given limited expert demonstrations. Existing Bayesian IRL
methods impose restrictions on the form of input data, thus limiting the
incorporation of training task data. To better leverage information from
training tasks, we introduce kernel density Bayesian inverse reinforcement
learning (KD-BIRL). Our approach employs a conditional kernel density
estimator, which uses the known reward functions of the training tasks to
improve the likelihood estimation across a range of reward functions and
demonstration samples. Our empirical results highlight KD-BIRL's faster
concentration rate in comparison to baselines, particularly in low test task
expert demonstration data regimes. Additionally, we are the first to provide
theoretical guarantees of posterior concentration for a Bayesian IRL algorithm.
Taken together, this work introduces a principled and theoretically grounded
framework that enables Bayesian IRL to be applied across a variety of domains.

### [319] [Avoiding Catastrophe in Online Learning by Asking for Help](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08062)
*Benjamin Plaut, Hanlin Zhu, Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses online learning with catastrophic mistakes, proposing a method to minimize catastrophe risk by querying a mentor and transferring knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning algorithms assume recoverable mistakes, but catastrophic (irreparable) mistakes require a new approach.

Method: The paper introduces an online learning problem where payoffs represent the chance of avoiding catastrophe, using mentor queries and knowledge transfer.

Result: Algorithms either query the mentor linearly or risk catastrophe, but a learnable policy class allows regret and query rates to approach zero over time.

Conclusion: Learnable policy classes can handle catastrophic risk if the agent can seek help, matching bounds for additive regret.

Abstract: Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume that all
mistakes are recoverable and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors.
This approach is problematic when some mistakes are "catastrophic", i.e.,
irreparable. We propose an online learning problem where the goal is to
minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff in
each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe in that round and try
to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe)
while allowing a limited number of queries to a mentor. We also assume that the
agent can transfer knowledge between similar inputs. We first show that in
general, any algorithm either queries the mentor at a linear rate or is nearly
guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, in settings where the mentor policy
class is learnable in the standard online model, we provide an algorithm whose
regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon
grows. Although our focus is the product of payoffs, we provide matching bounds
for the typical additive regret. Conceptually, if a policy class is learnable
in the absence of catastrophic risk, it is learnable in the presence of
catastrophic risk if the agent can ask for help.

*Jesse van Remmerden, Zaharah Bukhsh, Yingqian Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline-LD, an offline RL approach for JSSP, learns from historical data, outperforming online RL with limited expert solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of online RL (sample inefficiency, inability to leverage existing solutions, impractical simulated environments) by using historical data.

Method: Introduces maskable Q-learning variants (mQRDQN, d-mSAC) with CQL, entropy bonus for d-mSAC, and reward normalization.

Result: Outperforms online RL with only 100 CP solutions; noisy expert data yields comparable or better results.

Conclusion: Offline-LD is effective for JSSP, especially in real-world noisy data scenarios.

Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial
optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown
promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key
limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading
to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions from
traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP), and require simulated
environments to train in, which are impracticable to build for complex
scheduling environments. We introduce Offline Learned Dispatching (Offline-LD),
an offline reinforcement learning approach for JSSP, which addresses these
limitations by learning from historical scheduling data. Our approach is
motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions
are available or scenarios where online training of RL approaches with
simulated environments is impracticable. Offline-LD introduces maskable
variants of two Q-learning methods, namely, Maskable Quantile Regression DQN
(mQRDQN) and discrete maskable Soft Actor-Critic (d-mSAC), that are able to
learn from historical data, through Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). Moreover, we
present a novel entropy bonus modification for d-mSAC, for maskable action
spaces. Moreover, we introduce a novel reward normalization method for JSSP in
an offline RL setting. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms
online RL on both generated and benchmark instances when trained on only 100
solutions generated by CP. Notably, introducing noise to the expert dataset
yields comparable or superior results to using the expert dataset, with the
same amount of instances, a promising finding for real-world applications,
where data is inherently noisy and imperfect.

*Adam Sandler, Diego Klabjan, Yuan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes regularization methods to find flat minima in deep neural networks, improving generalization and outperforming baselines on real-world test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flat minima generalize better than sharp minima, especially when test data differs from training data.

Method: Regularized optimization to reduce the Hessian's spectral radius, with derived algorithms for efficient training and proven convergence.

Result: Models outperform baselines in generalizability tests across domains, including healthcare.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively finds flat minima, enhancing model generalization and performance.

Abstract: We develop regularization methods to find flat minima while training deep
neural networks. These minima generalize better than sharp minima, yielding
models outperforming baselines on real-world test data (which may be
distributed differently than the training data). Specifically, we propose a
method of regularized optimization to reduce the spectral radius of the Hessian
of the loss function. We also derive algorithms to efficiently optimize neural
network models and prove that these algorithms almost surely converge.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm works effectively on
applications in different domains, including healthcare. To show that our
models generalize well, we introduced various methods for testing
generalizability and found that our models outperform comparable baseline
models on these tests.

*Spencer Frei, Niladri S. Chatterji, Peter L. Bartlett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks trained with gradient descent exhibit benign overfitting, achieving zero training error and minimax optimal test error even with noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why interpolating models generalize well despite noisy data, especially in neural networks.

Method: Analyze two-layer neural networks trained with gradient descent on logistic loss, assuming well-separated class-conditional log-concave distributions and adversarial label corruption.

Result: Neural networks show benign overfitting: zero training error and optimal test error, even with noisy labels.

Conclusion: Benign overfitting occurs in nonlinear models like neural networks, extending beyond linear or kernel-based predictors.

Abstract: Benign overfitting, the phenomenon where interpolating models generalize well
in the presence of noisy data, was first observed in neural network models
trained with gradient descent. To better understand this empirical observation,
we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to
interpolation by gradient descent on the logistic loss following random
initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional
log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training
labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural
networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,
perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax
optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that
require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting
where both the model and learning dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear.

*Cosimo Gregucci, Bo Xiong, Daniel Hernandez, Lorenzo Loconte, Pasquale Minervini, Steffen Staab, Antonio Vergari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current benchmarks for complex query answering (CQA) on knowledge graphs (KGs) may overestimate progress, as many queries can be simplified to easier tasks like link prediction. New, more challenging benchmarks reveal limitations in state-of-the-art CQA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential overestimation of progress in CQA due to simplified benchmarks and to better reflect real-world KG complexity.

Method: Analyzed existing benchmarks, identified simplifiable queries, and proposed new benchmarks with multi-hop reasoning requirements.

Result: Performance of CQA models drops significantly on non-simplifiable queries, highlighting limitations in current methods.

Conclusion: New benchmarks expose gaps in CQA methods, urging the need for more robust reasoning capabilities in models.

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) on knowledge graphs (KGs) is gaining momentum
as a challenging reasoning task. In this paper, we show that the current
benchmarks for CQA might not be as complex as we think, as the way they are
built distorts our perception of progress in this field. For example, we find
that in these benchmarks, most queries (up to 98% for some query types) can be
reduced to simpler problems, e.g., link prediction, where only one link needs
to be predicted. The performance of state-of-the-art CQA models decreases
significantly when such models are evaluated on queries that cannot be reduced
to easier types. Thus, we propose a set of more challenging benchmarks composed
of queries that require models to reason over multiple hops and better reflect
the construction of real-world KGs. In a systematic empirical investigation,
the new benchmarks show that current methods leave much to be desired from
current CQA methods.

### [324] [Implicit Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Robust Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13431)
*Xiaoling Zhou, Ou Wu, Michael K. Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Implicit Counterfactual Data Augmentation (ICDA) to remove spurious correlations in ML models, improving generalization and robustness without explicit data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often rely on spurious correlations; counterfactual augmentation helps but is inefficient. ICDA aims to address this.

Method: Develops a sample-wise augmentation strategy, derives a surrogate loss for infinite augmented samples, and proposes parameter schemes (direct quantification and meta-learning).

Result: ICDA enhances generalization and robustness across biased learning scenarios in image and text datasets.

Conclusion: ICDA effectively removes spurious correlations and improves model stability without explicit data augmentation.

Abstract: Machine learning models are prone to capturing the spurious correlations
between non-causal attributes and classes, with counterfactual data
augmentation being a promising direction for breaking these spurious
associations. However, generating counterfactual data explicitly poses a
challenge, and incorporating augmented data into the training process decreases
training efficiency. This study proposes an Implicit Counterfactual Data
Augmentation (ICDA) method to remove spurious correlations and make stable
predictions. Specifically, first, a novel sample-wise augmentation strategy is
developed that generates semantically and counterfactually meaningful deep
features with distinct augmentation strength for each sample. Second, we derive
an easy-to-compute surrogate loss on the augmented feature set when the number
of augmented samples becomes infinite. Third, two concrete schemes are
proposed, including direct quantification and meta-learning, to derive the key
parameters for the robust loss. In addition, ICDA is explained from a
regularization perspective, revealing its capacity to improve intra-class
compactness and augment margins at both class and sample levels. Extensive
experiments have been conducted across various biased learning scenarios
covering both image and text datasets, demonstrating that ICDA consistently
enhances the generalization and robustness performance of popular networks.

*Mahsa Mozafari-Nia, Salimeh Yasaei Sekeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for DNN compression, explaining optimal sparsity via information-theoretic divergence measures and introduces AP2/AP3 properties to analyze performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical explanation for DNN compression techniques like pruning and low-rank decomposition.

Method: Leverages a probabilistic latent space of DNN weights, introduces AP2/AP3 properties, and provides theoretical analysis of compressed network training.

Result: Empirical validation on benchmarks (AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16) shows AP3/AP2 properties relate to fine-tuning pruned DNNs and sparsity levels.

Conclusion: The framework offers a theoretical foundation for understanding DNN compression, linking AP3/AP2 properties to network performance.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), their
computational complexity and storage space consumption have led to the concept
of network compression. While DNN compression techniques such as pruning and
low-rank decomposition have been extensively studied, there has been
insufficient attention paid to their theoretical explanation. In this paper, we
propose a novel theoretical framework that leverages a probabilistic latent
space of DNN weights and explains the optimal network sparsity by using the
information-theoretic divergence measures. We introduce new analogous projected
patterns (AP2) and analogous-in-probability projected patterns (AP3) notions
for DNNs and prove that there exists a relationship between AP3/AP2 property of
layers in the network and its performance. Further, we provide a theoretical
analysis that explains the training process of the compressed network. The
theoretical results are empirically validated through experiments conducted on
standard pre-trained benchmarks, including AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16, using
CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. Through our experiments, we highlight the
relationship of AP3 and AP2 properties with fine-tuning pruned DNNs and
sparsity levels.

TL;DR: The paper introduces tcKAE, a temporally consistent Koopman autoencoder, to improve long-term predictions in high-dimensional spatio-temporal systems with limited, noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of poor generalizability in Koopman Autoencoders (KAEs) due to limited and noisy training data.

Method: Introduces tcKAE with a consistency regularization term to enforce prediction coherence across time steps.

Result: tcKAE outperforms state-of-the-art KAE models in various test cases, including pendulum oscillations, plasma kinetics, and fluid flow.

Conclusion: tcKAE enhances robustness and generalizability, making it effective for data-driven modeling with limited, noisy datasets.

Abstract: Absence of sufficiently high-quality data often poses a key challenge in
data-driven modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal dynamical systems.
Koopman Autoencoders (KAEs) harness the expressivity of deep neural networks
(DNNs), the dimension reduction capabilities of autoencoders, and the spectral
properties of the Koopman operator to learn a reduced-order feature space with
simpler, linear dynamics. However, the effectiveness of KAEs is hindered by
limited and noisy training datasets, leading to poor generalizability. To
address this, we introduce the temporally consistent Koopman autoencoder
(tcKAE), designed to generate accurate long-term predictions even with limited
and noisy training data. This is achieved through a consistency regularization
term that enforces prediction coherence across different time steps, thus
enhancing the robustness and generalizability of tcKAE over existing models. We
provide analytical justification for this approach based on Koopman spectral
theory and empirically demonstrate tcKAE's superior performance over
state-of-the-art KAE models across a variety of test cases, including simple
pendulum oscillations, kinetic plasma, and fluid flow data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between model parameters and compute in scaling language models, focusing on sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) to optimize sparsity for improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the interplay between model parameters and compute affects capacity and performance in language models, particularly in sparse MoEs.

Method: Investigates varying sparsity levels in MoEs during pretraining and downstream few-shot evaluation under constraints like parameter size and training compute.

Result: Identifies an optimal sparsity level that enhances training efficiency and model performance under given constraints.

Conclusion: Provides insights into sparsity's role in scaling laws for MoEs, aiding the design of more efficient architectures.

Abstract: Scaling the capacity of language models has consistently proven to be a
reliable approach for improving performance and unlocking new capabilities.
Capacity can be primarily defined by two dimensions: the number of model
parameters and the compute per example. While scaling typically involves
increasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combined
contribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. We explore this
relationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), which allow
scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing the FLOPs
per example. We investigate how varying the sparsity level, i.e., the fraction
of inactive parameters, impacts model's performance during pretraining and
downstream few-shot evaluation. We find that under different constraints (e.g.,
parameter size and total training compute), there is an optimal level of
sparsity that improves both training efficiency and model performance. These
results provide a better understanding of the impact of sparsity in scaling
laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area, offering insights for
designing more efficient architectures.

Conclusion: TreeDOX offers a robust, hyperparameter-free solution for forecasting chaotic systems.

Abstract: Model-free forecasting of the temporal evolution of chaotic systems is
crucial but challenging. Existing solutions require hyperparameter tuning,
significantly hindering their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce a
tree-based approach not requiring hyperparameter tuning: TreeDOX. It uses time
delay overembedding as explicit short-term memory and Extra-Trees Regressors to
perform feature reduction and forecasting. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of TreeDOX using the Henon map, Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
systems, and the real-world Southern Oscillation Index.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed learning is vulnerable to attacks from malicious devices; this work aims to address this by developing resilient algorithms in a decentralized peer-to-peer setting.

Method: Uses a dual approach for decentralized optimization to design a Byzantine-robust algorithm, with analysis in the average consensus subcase and reinterpretation of existing algorithms.

Conclusion: The dual approach is effective for Byzantine resilience in decentralized learning, with potential applications beyond the studied subcase.

Abstract: Distributed learning has many computational benefits but is vulnerable to
attacks from a subset of devices transmitting incorrect information. This paper
investigates Byzantine-resilient algorithms in a decentralized setting, where
devices communicate directly in a peer-to-peer manner within a communication
network. We leverage the so-called dual approach for decentralized optimization
and propose a Byzantine-robust algorithm. We provide convergence guarantees in
the average consensus subcase, discuss the potential of the dual approach
beyond this subcase, and re-interpret existing algorithms using the dual
framework. Lastly, we experimentally show the soundness of our method.

Motivation: Accurate traffic anomaly detection is vital for urban traffic management and congestion reduction.

Method: Combines Spatiotemporal GAN (STGAN) with Graph Neural Networks and LSTMs to analyze spatial and temporal traffic data from 42 cameras.

Result: The model effectively detects anomalies like camera interruptions, visual artifacts, and weather impacts with high precision.

Conclusion: STGAN proves effective for real-time traffic anomaly detection, aiding urban traffic management.

Abstract: Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban
traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal
Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural
Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and
temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time,
minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg,
Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to
compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for
the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and
validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our
results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with
high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include
camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions
affecting traffic flow.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sparse tensor PCA model for unsupervised feature selection, addressing orientation-specific data challenges using T-SVDM and extending SPCA to tensor form. It ensures flexibility, accuracy, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods for unsupervised feature selection overlook data orientation, limiting their effectiveness for orientation-specific data like time series.

Method: The method extends SPCA to tensor form using T-SVDM, constrains sparsity at specified modes, and employs a convex version with a slice-by-slice algorithm for optimization.

Result: Experiments show the method's effectiveness and computational efficiency on diverse tensor data, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method is versatile and promising for applications where transform axes align with feature distribution patterns.

Abstract: Recently, introducing Tensor Decomposition (TD) techniques into unsupervised
feature selection (UFS) has been an emerging research topic. A tensor structure
is beneficial for mining the relations between different modes and helps
relieve the computation burden. However, while existing methods exploit TD to
preserve the data tensor structure, they do not consider the influence of data
orientation and thus have difficulty in handling orientation-specific data such
as time series. To solve the above problem, we utilize the
orientation-dependent tensor-tensor product from Tensor Singular Value
Decomposition based on *M-product (T-SVDM) and extend the one-dimensional
Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to a tensor form. The proposed
sparse tensor PCA model can constrain sparsity at the specified mode and yield
sparse tensor principal components, enhancing flexibility and accuracy in
learning feature relations. To ensure fast convergence and a flexible
description of feature correlation, we develop a convex version specially
designed for general UFS tasks and propose an efficient slice-by-slice
algorithm that performs dual optimization in the transform domain. Experimental
results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and remarkable
computational efficiency of the proposed method for tensor data of diverse
structures over the state-of-the-art. When transform axes align with feature
distribution patterns, our method is promising for various applications. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address environmental and equity concerns in large model deployment by leveraging existing adapters for efficient finetuning.

Method: Uses Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) to create a principal subspace, augmented with orthogonal vectors for low-resource tasks, requiring only lightweight coefficient learning.

Result: Significantly reduces parameters and memory usage while maintaining strong performance across diverse domains.

Conclusion: EigenLoRAx offers a scalable, efficient solution for edge applications, personalization, and equitable deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large models has raised concerns about their
environmental impact and equity in accessibility due to significant
computational costs. Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) offer a lightweight solution for
finetuning large models, resulting in an abundance of publicly available
adapters tailored to diverse domains. We ask: Can these pretrained adapters be
leveraged to further streamline adaptation to new tasks while addressing these
challenges? We introduce EigenLoRAx, a parameter-efficient finetuning method
that recycles existing adapters to create a principal subspace aligned with
their shared domain knowledge which can be further augmented with orthogonal
basis vectors in low-resource scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new
tasks by learning only lightweight coefficients on the principal components of
the subspace-eliminating the need to finetune entire adapters. EigenLoRAx
requires significantly fewer parameters and memory, improving efficiency for
both training and inference. Our method demonstrates strong performance across
diverse domains and tasks, offering a scalable for edge-based applications,
personalization, and equitable deployment of large models in
resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general-purpose chemical neural network framework that aligns with the analog nature of chemical kinetics, avoiding the complexity of higher-order chemistries.

Method: Uses continuous-time evolution of molecular concentrations for forward and backward learning passes, implemented via unimolecular and bimolecular reactions.

Result: Demonstrated efficient supervised learning in two stages and validated linear/nonlinear modeling capabilities with concise circuits.

Conclusion: Neural CRNs provide a compact, scalable, and autonomous framework for adaptive computing in synthetic biology and related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces Neural CRNs, a general-purpose chemical neural network
framework that embeds learning directly into mass-action chemical reaction
systems. Unlike prior approaches that chemically implement and compose discrete
neural computations, Neural CRNs adopt an analog computing approach, where both
forward and backward passes of learning are implemented as continuous-time
evolutions of molecular concentrations. Such an analog formulation naturally
aligns with the analog nature of chemical kinetics, yielding concise circuits
and practicable reactions. We demonstrate this efficiency by constructing a
streamlined supervised learning procedure executable in just two sequential
stages. We then implement several learning circuits to demonstrate the
framework's linear and nonlinear modeling capabilities and to validate its
learning procedure. These circuits are implemented entirely using unimolecular
and bimolecular reactions, avoiding the complexity of higher-order chemistries.
In summary, Neural CRNs offer a compact, scalable, and autonomous framework for
biochemical learning, opening new avenues for adaptive computing in synthetic
biology, bioengineering, and biomedicine.

TL;DR: A new target-equivariant architecture addresses the equivariance gap in foundational tabular data models, improving stability and performance on tasks with more classes than pre-training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models like TabPFN lack target equivariance, causing instability in predictions due to permutation sensitivity.

Method: The proposed architecture ensures permutation invariance using equivariant encoders, decoders, and a bi-attention mechanism.

Result: The model matches or outperforms existing methods on datasets with more classes than pre-training, with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Target-equivariant architectures can enhance stability and performance in tabular data models, especially for tasks beyond pre-training scope.

Abstract: Recent foundational models for tabular data, such as TabPFN, excel at
adapting to new tasks via in-context learning, but remain constrained to a
fixed, pre-defined number of target dimensions-often necessitating costly
ensembling strategies. We trace this constraint to a deeper architectural
shortcoming: these models lack target equivariance, so that permuting target
dimension orderings alters their predictions. This deficiency gives rise to an
irreducible "equivariance gap", an error term that introduces instability in
predictions. We eliminate this gap by designing a fully target-equivariant
architecture-ensuring permutation invariance via equivariant encoders,
decoders, and a bi-attention mechanism. Empirical evaluation on standard
classification benchmarks shows that, on datasets with more classes than those
seen during pre-training, our model matches or surpasses existing methods while
incurring lower computational overhead.

Result: The enhancements lead to state-of-the-art performance in image quality and sampling efficiency, while also improving sample diversity.

Conclusion: The work successfully unifies and expands diffusion bridge models, addressing key limitations and improving performance in diverse image-to-image tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models and stochastic interpolants enable high-quality
image-to-image (I2I) translation by creating paths between distributions in
pixel space. However, the proliferation of techniques based on incompatible
mathematical assumptions have impeded progress. In this work, we unify and
expand the space of bridge models by extending Stochastic Interpolants (SIs)
with preconditioning, endpoint conditioning, and an optimized sampling
algorithm. These enhancements expand the design space of diffusion bridge
models, leading to state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and
sampling efficiency across diverse I2I tasks. Furthermore, we identify and
address a previously overlooked issue of low sample diversity under fixed
conditions. We introduce a quantitative analysis for output diversity and
demonstrate how we can modify the base distribution for further improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interleaved Gibbs Diffusion (IGD) is a new generative framework for discrete-continuous data, improving performance by avoiding factorized denoising assumptions and enabling seamless integration of discrete and continuous denoisers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in prior discrete-continuous diffusion models that assume factorized denoising, which hinders modeling strong dependencies.

Method: IGD generalizes Gibbs sampling for discrete-continuous generation, ensuring exact reversal of the forward process and allowing flexible denoiser choices.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on molecule structures, layouts, and tabular data tasks without domain-specific biases.

Conclusion: IGD offers a versatile and effective approach for generative modeling in constrained discrete-continuous data problems.

Abstract: We introduce Interleaved Gibbs Diffusion (IGD), a novel generative modeling
framework for discrete-continuous data, focusing on problems with important,
implicit and unspecified constraints in the data. Most prior works on discrete
and discrete-continuous diffusion assume a factorized denoising distribution,
which can hinder the modeling of strong dependencies between random variables
in such problems. We empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in 3-SAT
performance out of the box by switching to a Gibbs-sampling style discrete
diffusion model which does not assume factorizability. Motivated by this, we
introduce IGD which generalizes discrete time Gibbs sampling type Markov chain
for the case of discrete-continuous generation. IGD allows for seamless
integration between discrete and continuous denoisers while theoretically
guaranteeing exact reversal of a suitable forward process. Further, it provides
flexibility in the choice of denoisers, allows conditional generation via
state-space doubling and inference time refinement. Empirical evaluations on
three challenging generation tasks - molecule structures, layouts and tabular
data - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, IGD achieves
state-of-the-art results without relying on domain-specific inductive biases
like equivariant diffusion or auxiliary losses. We explore a wide range of
modeling, and interleaving strategies along with hyperparameters in each of
these problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSPI, a method to verify the hardware and software used in black-box LLM services by analyzing input-output behavior, addressing concerns of misrepresented service quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Businesses often buy LLM services without verification of advertised hardware, risking subpar performance due to potential misrepresentation.

Method: HSPI analyzes numerical patterns in model outputs to classify GPU architecture and software stack.

Result: HSPI achieves 83.9% to 100% accuracy in white-box settings and outperforms random guesses in black-box settings.

Conclusion: HSPI effectively identifies underlying hardware and software, providing a tool for verifying LLM service authenticity.

Abstract: It is now a common business practice to buy access to large language model
(LLM) inference rather than self-host, because of significant upfront hardware
infrastructure and energy costs. However, as a buyer, there is no mechanism to
verify the authenticity of the advertised service including the serving
hardware platform, e.g. that it is actually being served using an NVIDIA H100.
Furthermore, there are reports suggesting that model providers may deliver
models that differ slightly from the advertised ones, often to make them run on
less expensive hardware. That way, a client pays premium for a capable model
access on more expensive hardware, yet ends up being served by a (potentially
less capable) cheaper model on cheaper hardware. In this paper we introduce
hardware and software platform inference (HSPI) -- a method for identifying the
underlying GPU architecture and software stack of a (black-box) machine
learning model solely based on its input-output behavior. Our method leverages
the inherent differences of various GPU architectures and compilers to
distinguish between different GPU types and software stacks. By analyzing the
numerical patterns in the model's outputs, we propose a classification
framework capable of accurately identifying the GPU used for model inference as
well as the underlying software configuration. Our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of inferring GPU type from black-box models. We evaluate HSPI
against models served on different real hardware and find that in a white-box
setting we can distinguish between different GPUs with between $83.9\%$ and
$100\%$ accuracy. Even in a black-box setting we achieve results that are up to
3x higher than random guess accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GlucoLens is an explainable ML system predicting postprandial glucose AUC and hyperglycemia using wearable data, achieving 16% better performance than comparison models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Postprandial hyperglycemia indicates diabetes risk; predicting AUC and explaining influencing lifestyle factors can help individuals maintain normal glucose levels.

Method: Developed GlucoLens, integrating wearable sensor data (activity, glucose), food/work logs, and ML (LLMs, trainable models) for interpretable predictions.

Result: Achieved NRMSE of 0.123, 73.3% hyperglycemia prediction accuracy, and 16% better performance than baselines.

Conclusion: GlucoLens effectively predicts and explains postprandial glucose patterns, aiding personalized lifestyle adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia.

Abstract: Postprandial hyperglycemia, marked by the blood glucose level exceeding the
normal range after consuming a meal, is a critical indicator of progression
toward type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes and in healthy individuals. A
key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the
postprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance
based on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity
level, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could
allow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal
glucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning
solution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data
processing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to
predict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and
recent glucose patterns. We used data obtained from wearables in a five-week
clinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the
proposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data,
and machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from
wearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work
logs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose
pattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error
(NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology
provides a 16% better performance level compared to the comparison models.
Additionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 73.3%
and an F1 score of 0.716 and recommends different treatment options to help
avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations. Code

### [339] [TAROT: Targeted Data Selection via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00420)
*Lan Feng, Fan Nie, Yuejiang Liu, Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAROT is a targeted data selection framework using optimal transport theory to improve domain-specific performance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods struggle with multimodal distributions due to dominant feature bias and linear additive assumptions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: TAROT uses whitened feature distance to mitigate bias and minimizes optimal transport distance between selected and target data, estimating optimal selection ratios.

Result: TAROT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tasks like semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction tuning.

Conclusion: TAROT effectively addresses limitations of previous methods, demonstrating versatility and superior performance across diverse deep learning tasks.

Abstract: We propose TAROT, a targeted data selection framework grounded in optimal
transport theory. Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on
influence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While
effective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern),
these methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in
multimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple
inherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies
two primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate
impact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation,
and (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy
selection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened
feature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable
measure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature
distance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the
selected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates
the estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple
tasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction
tuning. Results consistently show that TAROT outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, highlighting its versatility across various deep learning tasks. Code

### [340] [Down with the Hierarchy: The 'H' in HNSW Stands for "Hubs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01940)
*Blaise Munyampirwa, Vihan Lakshman, Benjamin Coleman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study challenges the necessity of hierarchical layers in HNSW for ANN search, finding flat graphs perform equally well with less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the hierarchical structure in HNSW is essential for efficient ANN search, given its dominance in the field.

Method: Extensive benchmarking on large-scale datasets comparing flat navigable small world graphs to HNSW.

Result: Flat graphs match HNSW in latency and recall while using less memory; the hierarchy is unnecessary in high dimensions.

Conclusion: The Hub Highway Hypothesis explains the hierarchy's redundancy, suggesting future research directions for graph-based ANN search.

Abstract: Driven by recent breakthrough advances in neural representation learning,
approximate near-neighbor (ANN) search over vector embeddings has emerged as a
critical computational workload. With the introduction of the seminal
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm, graph-based indexes have
established themselves as the overwhelmingly dominant paradigm for efficient
and scalable ANN search. As the name suggests, HNSW searches a layered
hierarchical graph to quickly identify neighborhoods of similar points to a
given query vector. But is this hierarchy even necessary? A rigorous
experimental analysis to answer this question would provide valuable insights
into the nature of algorithm design for ANN search and motivate directions for
future work in this increasingly crucial domain. We conduct an extensive
benchmarking study covering more large-scale datasets than prior investigations
of this question. We ultimately find that a flat navigable small world graph
graph retains all of the benefits of HNSW on high-dimensional datasets, with
latency and recall performance essentially \emph{identical} to the original
algorithm but with less memory overhead. Furthermore, we go a step further and
study \emph{why} the hierarchy of HNSW provides no benefit in high dimensions,
hypothesizing that navigable small world graphs contain a well-connected,
frequently traversed ``highway" of hub nodes that maintain the same purported
function as the hierarchical layers. We present compelling empirical evidence
that the \emph{Hub Highway Hypothesis} holds for real datasets and investigate
the mechanisms by which the highway forms. The implications of this hypothesis
may also provide future research directions in developing enhancements to
graph-based ANN search.

*Shehel Yoosuf, Temoor Ali, Ahmed Lekssays, Mashael AlSabah, Issa Khalil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents structure transformation attacks on LLM alignment, achieving high success rates (up to 96%) by using diverse syntax spaces, including novel ones generated by LLMs. Existing defenses fail, highlighting the need for improved safety alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in LLM alignment by demonstrating how structure transformations can bypass safety mechanisms, motivating the need for more robust defenses.

Method: Uses diverse syntax spaces (simple formats, SQL, LLM-generated syntaxes) and combines structure with content transformations for adaptive attacks. Evaluates attacks on strict LLMs and benchmarks existing defenses.

Result: Achieves up to 96% attack success rate (ASR) with 0% refusals. Most existing defenses fail (100% ASR). Demonstrates practical attacks like malware and fraudulent SMS generation.

Conclusion: Current safety alignment relies on token-level patterns, failing against structure transformations. Urges research for concept-aware defenses.

Abstract: In this work, we present a series of structure transformation attacks on LLM
alignment, where we encode natural language intent using diverse syntax spaces,
ranging from simple structure formats and basic query languages (e.g., SQL) to
new novel spaces and syntaxes created entirely by LLMs. Our extensive
evaluation shows that our simplest attacks can achieve close to a 90% success
rate, even on strict LLMs (such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using SOTA alignment
mechanisms. We improve the attack performance further by using an adaptive
scheme that combines structure transformations along with existing content
transformations, resulting in over 96% ASR with 0% refusals.
  To generalize our attacks, we explore numerous structure formats, including
syntaxes purely generated by LLMs. Our results indicate that such novel
syntaxes are easy to generate and result in a high ASR, suggesting that
defending against our attacks is not a straightforward process. Finally, we
develop a benchmark and evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses against it,
showing that most of them fail with 100% ASR. Our results show that existing
safety alignment mostly relies on token-level patterns without recognizing
harmful concepts, highlighting and motivating the need for serious research
efforts in this direction. As a case study, we demonstrate how attackers can
use our attack to easily generate a sample malware and a corpus of fraudulent
SMS messages, which perform well in bypassing detection.

*Runzhong Wang, Rui-Xi Wang, Mrunali Manjrekar, Connor W. Coley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARASON, a novel model using neural graph matching, improves molecular machine learning by enhancing retrieval-augmented generation, achieving 28% top-1 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unclear optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning and the potential of graph neural networks to benefit from structural alignment understanding.

Method: Neural graph matching to model node and edge affinities between molecular graphs, applied to mass spectrum simulation.

Result: MARASON achieves 28% top-1 accuracy, outperforming non-retrieval methods (19%) and traditional graph matching.

Conclusion: Neural graph matching effectively enhances retrieval-augmented molecular machine learning, as demonstrated by MARASON's performance.

Abstract: Molecular machine learning has gained popularity with the advancements of
geometric deep learning. In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become
a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal
integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains
unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to
understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule.
Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node
and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a
noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply
this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model
that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural
network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with
MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the
non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms
both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph
matching approaches. Code is publicly available at

### [343] [Reliable algorithm selection for machine learning-guided design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20767)
*Clara Fannjiang, Ji Won Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for selecting machine learning-guided design algorithms to ensure successful outcomes, validated in protein and RNA design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of choosing the right design algorithm and parameters for successful novel object design, such as proteins with high binding affinity.

Method: Combines predicted property values with held-out labeled data to forecast label distributions, using prediction-powered inference techniques.

Result: Guarantees high-probability success in selecting algorithms that meet user-specified criteria, demonstrated in protein and RNA design simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method reliably selects effective design algorithms, even with estimated density ratios, enhancing machine learning-guided design.

Abstract: Algorithms for machine learning-guided design, or design algorithms, use
machine learning-based predictions to propose novel objects with desired
property values. Given a new design task -- for example, to design novel
proteins with high binding affinity to a therapeutic target -- one must choose
a design algorithm and specify any hyperparameters and predictive and/or
generative models involved. How can these decisions be made such that the
resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design
algorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a
distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion --
for example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold.
It does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out
labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions
produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from
prediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to
return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null
set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data
distributions are known. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated
protein and RNA design tasks, in settings with either known or estimated
density ratios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MInCo resolves information conflicts in visual MBRL by using contrastive learning and time-varying reweighting, improving robustness against distractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual MBRL algorithms struggle with information conflicts and noisy observations, leading to less robust policies.

Method: MInCo leverages negative-free contrastive learning and time-varying reweighting to mitigate conflicts and balance representation learning with dynamics modeling.

Result: MInCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robotic control tasks with dynamic background distractions.

Conclusion: MInCo effectively addresses information conflicts, enhancing representation learning and policy robustness in visual MBRL.

Abstract: Existing visual model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms with
observation reconstruction often suffer from information conflicts, making it
difficult to learn compact representations and hence result in less robust
policies, especially in the presence of task-irrelevant visual distractions. In
this paper, we first reveal that the information conflicts in current visual
MBRL algorithms stem from visual representation learning and latent dynamics
modeling with an information-theoretic perspective. Based on this finding, we
present a new algorithm to resolve information conflicts for visual MBRL, named
MInCo, which mitigates information conflicts by leveraging negative-free
contrastive learning, aiding in learning invariant representation and robust
policies despite noisy observations. To prevent the dominance of visual
representation learning, we introduce time-varying reweighting to bias the
learning towards dynamics modeling as training proceeds. We evaluate our method
on several robotic control tasks with dynamic background distractions. Our
experiments demonstrate that MInCo learns invariant representations against
background noise and consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art visual
MBRL methods. Code is available at https://github.com/ShiguangSun/minco.

Motivation: To address the challenge of simulating time-dependent ice sheet dynamics, which involves complex free-boundary conditions, by combining traditional mathematical modeling with deep learning.

Method: Uses a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the time-dependent parabolic obstacle problem under the Shallow Ice Approximation, validated through 1D and 2D simulations.

Result: The model effectively captures complex free-boundary conditions and provides a scalable, robust solution for predicting temporal variations in ice thickness.

Conclusion: The PINN approach successfully extends to time-dependent ice sheet dynamics, validated by simulations and real-world application to the Devon Ice Cap.

Abstract: In this article we develop a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach
to simulate ice sheet dynamics governed by the Shallow Ice Approximation. This
problem takes the form of a time-dependent parabolic obstacle problem. Prior
work has used this approach to address the stationary obstacle problem and here
we extend it to the time dependent problem. Through comprehensive 1D and 2D
simulations, we validate the model's effectiveness in capturing complex
free-boundary conditions. By merging traditional mathematical modeling with
cutting-edge deep learning methods, this approach provides a scalable and
robust solution for predicting temporal variations in ice thickness. To
illustrate this approach in a real world setting, we simulate the dynamics of
the Devon Ice Cap, incorporating aerogeophysical data from 2000 and 2018.

TL;DR: Surrogate models improve NAS efficiency by predicting architecture performance, speeding up search, and enhancing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing exploration and evaluation in NAS for architectural innovation.

Method: Uses surrogate models trained with zero-cost-proxy metrics, neural graph features (GRAF), or fine-tuned LMs.

Result: Surrogates effectively filter bad architectures, speed up search, and improve performance.

Conclusion: Surrogate models are powerful tools for efficient and effective NAS in expressive search spaces.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the
exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural
innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to
effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for
improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free
grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy
metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM
have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and
across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad
architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding
up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can
be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

*Alberto Casagrande, Francesco Fabris, Rossano Girometti, Roberto Pagliarini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a general method to evaluate the significance of agreement measures between classifiers, introducing two new indices and efficient algorithms for their computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agreement measures (e.g., Cohen's kappa) lack robust scales or significance indices, often relying on arbitrary boundaries. This work aims to provide a more rigorous evaluation framework.

Method: The authors introduce two significativity indices: one for finite datasets and another for classification probability distributions. They also address computational challenges by proposing efficient algorithms.

Result: The paper presents a general approach to assess agreement significance, along with practical indices and computational solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the evaluation of classifier agreement, offering more meaningful and computationally feasible tools.

Abstract: Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge
the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of
contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical
treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can
quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The
consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared
simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to
the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad
exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a
significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature
for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly na\"ive, and their boundaries are
arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the
significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces
two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one
handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript
addresses the computational challenges of evaluating such indices and proposes
some efficient algorithms for their evaluation.

Motivation: To demonstrate the first public end-to-end reinforcement learning policy deployment on Spot hardware, with publicly available training and deployment code, addressing sim2real gaps and optimizing unknown parameters.

Method: Uses Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy to quantify sim2real gaps, employs CMA-ES for parameter optimization, and trains policies capable of multiple gaits and high-speed locomotion.

Result: Policies achieve over 5.2ms locomotion (triple Spot's default speed), robustness to slippery surfaces, disturbance rejection, and unmatched agility.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges sim2real gaps and optimizes parameters, producing high-quality policies for Spot, with code released to support future research.

Abstract: This work presents an overview of the technical details behind a high

Researcher Development Kit for low level motor access on Boston Dynamics Spot.
This represents the first public demonstration of an end to end end
reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code
publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available

Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on
hardware and in simulation to measure our sim2real gap. We use these measures
as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from
Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality
reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight
phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Transformer-based method for multivariate time series forecasting, addressing cross-time and cross-variate dependencies with gating mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of modeling both temporal and variate dependencies in multivariate time series forecasting using Transformers, while optimizing performance and efficiency.

Method: Embedding variates independently for cross-time dynamics, then modeling cross-variate dependencies via attention mechanisms with gating operations to regulate information flow.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on 13 datasets, with up to 20.7% improvement over original models.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates cross-time and cross-variate dependencies in Transformers, offering significant performance gains and compatibility with other models.

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is

TL;DR: A novel method for dynamic causal discovery in neuroscience improves hypothesis generation by modeling time-varying interactions, outperforming baselines by 22-28% (up to 60%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume static causal relationships, limiting their use in dynamic systems like the brain. This work aims to capture nonlinear, state-dependent interactions.

Method: Proposes modeling dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, enabling detection of complex, time-varying relationships.

Result: Improves F1-scores by 22-28% on average (up to 60%) over baselines. Validated with real brain data, revealing behavior-linked neural dynamics.

Conclusion: The method advances dynamic causal discovery, offering insights into neural systems and improving hypothesis generation efficiency.

Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience
by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various
phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses
from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are
static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic,
state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt
dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict
relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We
propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted
superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear
relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying
interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves
f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average
over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well
over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to
uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable
insights into neural dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces evaluations to detect AI models capable of scheming (misaligned objectives) by assessing stealth and situational awareness, finding no current models pose risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of AI models scheming (pursuing misaligned goals covertly), which could lead to severe loss of control if undetected.

Method: Proposes 5 evaluations for stealth (circumventing oversight) and 11 for situational awareness (instrumental reasoning). Tests these on frontier models.

Result: Current frontier models show no concerning levels of stealth or situational awareness, suggesting they are incapable of harmful scheming.

Conclusion: The evaluations provide a safety case to rule out scheming risks in AI models before deployment.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming
-- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's
intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in
future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is
therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to
model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning
evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are
prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of
ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present
eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason
about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We
demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability
safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost
certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We
run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show
concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'skyline explanation' for interpreting GNN outputs by optimizing multiple explainability measures, proposing efficient algorithms and scalability solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN interpretation methods are biased due to reliance on single pre-defined measures, limiting comprehensive understanding.

Method: Proposes skyline explanations as Pareto sets of subgraphs, designs onion-peeling and diversification algorithms, and parallelizes for scalability.

Result: Algorithms effectively and scalably generate diverse skyline explanations, verified on real-world and synthetic graphs.

Conclusion: Skyline explanation offers a balanced, multi-measure approach for interpreting GNN outputs, with practical efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models
such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks.
Nevertheless, GNNs outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively.
Existing methods typically compromise to individual pre-defined explainability
measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-sided''
interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that
interprets GNN output by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability
measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto
set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory
measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization
problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms
with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and
removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3)
We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich
the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel
algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for
large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we
experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.

TL;DR: TensorGuard is a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for detecting LLM lineage and enforcing licensing agreements by analyzing gradient responses to input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unauthorized derivations of LLMs pose challenges in tracking model lineage and enforcing licensing, especially for open-source models like LLaMA.

Method: TensorGuard extracts behavioral signatures from gradient responses to random input perturbations, creating high-dimensional fingerprints for similarity assessment and family classification using K-Means clustering.

Result: Achieves 94% classification accuracy on 58 models across 5 families.

Conclusion: TensorGuard effectively addresses the gap in LLM provenance tracking and licensing compliance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern
applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and
redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike
traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are
well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model
lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic
when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works
to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to
verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance
tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for
LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts
model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random
input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training
data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the
widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints
through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable
two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between
arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family
classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with
domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental
evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five
model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94%
classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

*Yaxin Hou, Yuheng Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses long-tailed semi-supervised learning with distribution mismatch by proposing dynamic expert assignment and multi-depth feature fusion to improve pseudo-label quality and reduce model bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LTSSL with distribution mismatch fail to fully utilize the expertise of auxiliary classifiers (experts), leading to suboptimal pseudo-labeling.

Method: Introduces a dynamic expert assignment module to estimate sample class membership and assign suitable experts, along with a multi-depth feature fusion module to mitigate model bias.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT, and SVHN-LT datasets, demonstrating improved generalization.

Conclusion: Dynamic expert assignment and multi-depth feature fusion effectively address LTSSL challenges, enhancing pseudo-label quality and reducing bias.

Abstract: This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with
distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training
data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the
unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers
(experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce
pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We
observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of
samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head
interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval.
Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the
class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and
dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated
membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and
produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that
integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization
error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward
the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower
features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We,
therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different
depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its
effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT,
and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. The code is available at

*Mohammad Jalali, Bahar Dibaei Nia, Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SPEC framework to compare and align feature embeddings by analyzing clustering mismatches, with scalable implementation and applications on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparisons of feature embeddings focus on numerical performance, lacking interpretability. The need arises for a method to analyze clustering mismatches between embeddings.

Method: Proposes the SPEC framework, which examines kernel matrices from embeddings and uses eigendecomposition to detect differences in clustering. Includes a scalable implementation and an optimization problem for alignment.

Result: Demonstrates SPEC's effectiveness in comparing and aligning embeddings on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and MS-COCO.

Conclusion: SPEC provides an interpretable and scalable solution for comparing and aligning feature embeddings, addressing clustering mismatches.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting is challenging due to temporal heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and lack of symbolic structure.

Method: DRAGON discretizes sequences, maps them to a fixed graph structure, and uses graph-based attention for dynamic context recovery. It integrates with a dual-branch architecture.

Result: The method augments CNN-based encoders with symbolic, structure-aware representations.

Conclusion: DRAGON bridges symbolic and neural approaches, improving time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a challenging task for foundation models due

*Zhiqi Wang, Chengyu Zhang, Yuetian Chen, Nathalie Baracaldo, Swanand Kadhe, Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses disparities in membership inference attacks (MIAs) and proposes an ensemble framework to improve privacy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior MIA research overlooks disparities among attacks, impacting reliability and completeness of privacy assessments.

Method: A novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis is used to investigate MIA disparities, followed by an ensemble approach with three strategies.

Result: Experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their causes, and implications for privacy evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble framework enhances attack power and provides a robust methodology for privacy evaluation.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a significant threat to the privacy
of machine learning models and are widely used as tools for privacy assessment,
auditing, and machine unlearning. While prior MIA research has primarily
focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either
by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate
privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different
attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between
multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the
reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this
paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel
framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments
reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their
broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we
propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the
strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This
framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also
provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.

TL;DR: ReaPER improves PER by introducing a reliability measure for temporal difference errors, enhancing learning efficiency and outperforming PER in benchmarks like Atari-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of uniform sampling in PER by incorporating a reliability measure for better transition selection.

Method: Proposed ReaPER, which adjusts PER by measuring temporal difference error reliability, theoretically and empirically validated.

Result: ReaPER outperforms PER in learning efficiency across various environments, including Atari-10.

Conclusion: ReaPER enhances PER by reliably prioritizing transitions, leading to more efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-10 benchmark.

### [359] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li, Chenrui Fan, Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates grokking in large language models (LLMs) during pretraining, revealing asynchronous grokking stages and internal dynamics like pathway evolution from random to structured. It introduces metrics to predict generalization without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand grokking (delayed generalization) in LLMs and demystify its mechanism, especially in large-scale pretraining.

Method: Analyzes checkpoints of a 7B LLM (OLMoE) during pretraining, evaluating training loss and generalization on diverse tasks. Introduces pathway distance and complexity metrics.

Result: Grokking occurs in LLM pretraining with asynchronous stages. Pathways evolve from random to structured, indicating memorization-to-generalization. Metrics predict generalization improvement.

Conclusion: Pathway evolution explains delayed generalization. Novel metrics offer practical pretraining monitoring. Structured pathways improve generalization bounds theoretically.

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between
samples. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization "knowledge
digestion", providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In
the study, we develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the
complexity of a single pathway. We show their ability to predict the
generalization improvement on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient,
simple to compute and solely dependent on training data. Hence, they have
practical value for pretraining, enabling us to monitor the generalization
performance without finetuning and test. Theoretically, we show that more
structured pathways reduce model complexity and improve the generalization
bound.

*Denis Gudovskiy, Wenzhao Zheng, Tomoyuki Okuno, Yohei Nakata, Kurt Keutzer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic control method for the quality-complexity tradeoff in CNFs and DMs by rewiring transformer blocks and using consistency terms, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational complexity and latency in sampling from CNFs and DMs by dynamically controlling time steps and neural network length.

Method: Rewires transformer blocks to solve an inner discretized ODE and employs time- and length-wise consistency terms during training, enabling flexible sampling.

Result: Achieves up to 3x latency reduction and 3.5-point FID score improvement in image generation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed ODE$_t$(ODE$_l$) approach is solver-agnostic, reduces latency and memory usage, and outperforms prior methods.

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
ODE$_t$(ODE$_l$) approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases
both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image
generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up
to 3$\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement
of up to 3.5 points for high-quality sampling. We release our code and model
weights with fully reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: A novel dataset on global migration flows (1990-present) uses deep learning to estimate patterns, outperforming traditional methods with higher resolution and uncertainty bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive, high-resolution dataset on global migration flows and stocks, addressing gaps in existing data and methods.

Method: A deep recurrent neural network trained on 18 covariates (geographic, economic, cultural, etc.) with ensemble learning for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods, offering higher temporal resolution and confidence bounds for estimates.

Conclusion: The open-source model and data provide a valuable resource for future migration studies.

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual
migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 35 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

*Zuguang Li, Wen Wu, Shaohua Wu, Songge Zhang, Ye Wang, Xuemin, Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a DAG-based algorithm for optimal model splitting in split learning, reducing computational complexity and training delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational complexity of finding optimal model splitting in complex AI architectures for split learning.

Method: Represents AI models as DAGs, reformulates splitting as a minimum s-t cut problem, and proposes fast DAG-based and block-wise splitting algorithms.

Result: The algorithms achieve optimal splitting in milliseconds and reduce training delay by 24.62%-38.95% compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods efficiently solve the model splitting problem, enhancing split learning performance in dynamic edge networks.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for
artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

*Jiongli Zhu, Parjanya Prajakta Prashant, Alex Cloninger, Babak Salimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAIROS is a scalable, model-agnostic framework for data valuation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency by using MMD-based influence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data valuation methods are biased, costly, or inaccurate, limiting their practical use for regulatory compliance and AI asset valuation.

Method: KAIROS assigns distributional influence scores using MMD between training data and a reference set, avoiding retraining and providing closed-form solutions.

Result: KAIROS achieves up to 50x speedup, outperforms baselines in accuracy and runtime, and handles noise, mislabeling, and poisoning effectively.

Conclusion: KAIROS offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for data valuation with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits.

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory
compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods
remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and
inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley
require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based
model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to
their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable,
model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional
influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike
Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution
that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error,
requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for
unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient
online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated
in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking
quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks
show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,
and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings
and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSAC-D, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm, uses multimodal distributions to improve value function estimation and policy representation, achieving SOTA performance in control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unimodal distributions in reinforcement learning cause bias in value function estimation, leading to poor performance. This paper aims to address this by introducing multimodal distributions.

Method: The paper proposes DSAC-D, combining policy entropy and value distribution functions in a multimodal framework. It uses a diffusion model for reverse sampling to construct a diffusion value network for accurate multi-peak distribution characterization.

Result: DSAC-D achieves SOTA performance in 9 MuJoCo control tasks, reducing estimation bias and improving average return by over 10%. Real vehicle tests confirm its ability to model multimodal driving styles and trajectories.

Conclusion: DSAC-D effectively addresses bias in value estimation and enables multimodal policy learning, demonstrating superior performance in both simulated and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks QDE methods, introduces OrderedLogitNN, and proposes balanced DRPS for fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address neglect of ordinal nature in QDE and biased evaluation metrics.

Method: Benchmarks discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression; introduces OrderedLogitNN and balanced DRPS.

Result: OrderedLogitNN outperforms on complex tasks; balanced DRPS proves robust.

Conclusion: Provides a principled foundation for QDE research with improved methods and metrics.

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

*Dang Qua Nguyen, Morteza Hashemi, Erik Perrins, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, David J. Love, Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) for federated learning (FL) to simultaneously ensure differential privacy (DP) and minimize quantization error, addressing privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces challenges like privacy risks from unprotected model updates and reduced utility due to quantization heterogeneity. Existing solutions address only one issue, motivating a unified approach.

Method: Introduces a stochastic quantizer (SQ) for DP and minimal quantization error, alongside cluster size optimization and linear fusion for accurate model aggregation.

Result: Numerical simulations show improved privacy protection and learning utility over the LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed SQ effectively balances privacy and utility in FL, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed
machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across
multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its
advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from
the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)
and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model
quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically
addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility
under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.
In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a
privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different
quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we
introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously
achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the
proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To
address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization
technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation
accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms
of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional
LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores aligning disjoint vision and language models into a shared representation using the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework, evaluating alignment objectives, layer depth, and model scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained models may converge to a shared reality model, prompting the need for explicit alignment optimization.

Method: Introduces JAM, a framework training modality-specific autoencoders on pre-trained models' latent representations, using reconstruction and cross-modal objectives for alignment.

Result: JAM reliably induces alignment across frozen, independently trained representations, proving effective for transforming unimodal models into multimodal ones.

Conclusion: The lightweight Pareto-efficient JAM framework offers theoretical and practical insights for aligning disjoint representations, advancing multimodal model development.

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Motivation: To address the gap in understanding LLM reasoning in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent environments like cooperative gameplay.

Method: Combines LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time adaptation, using game-theoretic principles (belief consistency, Nash equilibrium) and adaptive feedback mechanisms.

Result: Achieves 26% improvement over PPO baselines in high-noise environments with real-time latency under 1.05 milliseconds, enhancing collaboration and task completion.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic guidance with real-time feedback improves LLM performance, enabling resilient and flexible multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities across
mathematical, strategic, and linguistic tasks, yet little is known about how
well they reason in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent scenarios, such as
collaborative environments in which agents continuously adapt to each other's
behavior, as in cooperative gameplay settings. In this paper, we bridge this
gap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time
adaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic
principles such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed
framework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate,
communicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing
conditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback
mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate
contextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM
capabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our
method achieves up to a 26\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in
high-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05
milliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion
rates, and flexibility, illustrating that game-theoretic guidance integrated
with real-time feedback enhances LLM performance, ultimately fostering more
resilient and flexible strategic multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: TAGF, a Time-aware Gated Fusion framework, improves multimodal emotion recognition by addressing noise and misalignment between audio-visual modalities using a BiLSTM-based temporal gating mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in valence-arousal estimation due to noise and misalignment between audio and visual modalities.

Method: Introduces TAGF with a BiLSTM-based temporal gating mechanism to adaptively modulate recursive attention outputs and integrate multistep cross-modal features.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on the Aff-Wild2 dataset, showing robustness to cross-modal misalignment and dynamic emotional transitions.

Conclusion: TAGF effectively captures sequential emotional evolution and cross-modal interplay, offering improved robustness and performance in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition often suffers from performance degradation in
valence-arousal estimation due to noise and misalignment between audio and
visual modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce TAGF, a Time-aware
Gated Fusion framework for multimodal emotion recognition. The TAGF adaptively
modulates the contribution of recursive attention outputs based on temporal
dynamics. Specifically, the TAGF incorporates a BiLSTM-based temporal gating
mechanism to learn the relative importance of each recursive step and
effectively integrates multistep cross-modal features. By embedding temporal
awareness into the recursive fusion process, the TAGF effectively captures the
sequential evolution of emotional expressions and the complex interplay between
modalities. Experimental results on the Aff-Wild2 dataset demonstrate that TAGF
achieves competitive performance compared with existing recursive
attention-based models. Furthermore, TAGF exhibits strong robustness to
cross-modal misalignment and reliably models dynamic emotional transitions in
real-world conditions.

TL;DR: VRAgent-R1 introduces two agents (IP and US) for video recommendation, improving item modeling and user preference learning with multimodal understanding and reinforcement learning, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based video recommendation systems struggle with multimodal content understanding and user preference learning, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: VRAgent-R1 uses an Item Perception (IP) Agent for multimodal content understanding and a User Simulation (US) Agent for preference alignment via reinforcement learning.

Result: IP Agent improves NDCG@10 by 6.0%, and US Agent achieves ~45.0% higher accuracy in user decision simulation.

Conclusion: VRAgent-R1 effectively addresses multimodal and preference challenges, enhancing video recommendation performance.

Abstract: Owing to powerful natural language processing and generative capabilities,
large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution for
enhancing recommendation systems via user simulation. However, in the realm of
video recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based
simulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of
multimodal content understanding. This frequently results in suboptimal item
modeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining
recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce
VRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like
intelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two
distinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US)
Agent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent
emulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing
hidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal
content understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system
is equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US
Agent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences
through reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video
recommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed
VRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\% improvement in NDCG@10
on the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\%
higher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based model, PPG2Speech, edits native speech to approximate L2 speech without text alignment, validated on Finnish with 60 hours of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of L2 speech synthesis datasets for low-resourced languages to enhance language learning.

Method: Uses Matcha-TTS's flow-matching decoder with Classifier-free Guidance and Sway Sampling, transforming Phonetic Posteriorgrams (PPGs) to mel-spectrograms.

Result: Effective editing of single phonemes, validated by objective (PAC) and subjective evaluations for naturalness and speaker similarity.

Conclusion: PPG2Speech provides a practical solution for L2 speech synthesis, especially for low-resourced languages like Finnish.

Abstract: Synthesizing second-language (L2) speech is potentially highly valued for L2
language learning experience and feedback. However, due to the lack of L2
speech synthesis datasets, it is difficult to synthesize L2 speech for
low-resourced languages. In this paper, we provide a practical solution for
editing native speech to approximate L2 speech and present PPG2Speech, a
diffusion-based multispeaker Phonetic-Posteriorgrams-to-Speech model that is
capable of editing a single phoneme without text alignment. We use Matcha-TTS's
flow-matching decoder as the backbone, transforming Phonetic Posteriorgrams
(PPGs) to mel-spectrograms conditioned on external speaker embeddings and
pitch. PPG2Speech strengthens the Matcha-TTS's flow-matching decoder with
Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) and Sway Sampling. We also propose a new
task-specific objective evaluation metric, the Phonetic Aligned Consistency
(PAC), between the edited PPGs and the PPGs extracted from the synthetic speech
for editing effects. We validate the effectiveness of our method on Finnish, a
low-resourced, nearly phonetic language, using approximately 60 hours of data.
We conduct objective and subjective evaluations of our approach to compare its
naturalness, speaker similarity, and editing effectiveness with TTS-based
editing. Our source code is published at

TL;DR: A novel iterative phase estimation framework (MSGLA) is proposed for speech enhancement, leveraging STFT spectrogram constraints and geometric laws to address phase ambiguity, showing competitive performance against existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the sign ambiguity challenge in phase estimation for speech enhancement under additive noise conditions.

Method: Uses multi-source Griffin-Lim algorithm (MSGLA) with STFT spectrogram constraints and a geometric framework based on sine/cosine laws for phase reconstruction.

Result: MSGLA variants perform comparably or better than existing methods, particularly in background noise suppression, as validated on VB-DMD and WSJ0-CHiME3 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MSGLA framework effectively addresses phase estimation challenges and enhances speech quality under noisy conditions.

Abstract: We propose a novel iterative phase estimation framework, termed multi-source
Griffin-Lim algorithm (MSGLA), for speech enhancement (SE) under additive noise
conditions. The core idea is to leverage the ad-hoc consistency constraint of
complex-valued short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrograms to address the
sign ambiguity challenge commonly encountered in geometry-based phase
estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a variant of the geometric constraint
framework based on the law of sines and cosines, formulating a new phase
reconstruction algorithm using noise phase estimates. We first validate the
proposed technique through a series of oracle experiments, demonstrating its
effectiveness under ideal conditions. We then evaluate its performance on the
VB-DMD and WSJ0-CHiME3 data sets, and show that the proposed MSGLA variants
match well or slightly outperform existing algorithms, including direct phase
estimation and DNN-based sign prediction, especially in terms of background
noise suppression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address communication and accessibility challenges in multilingual contexts by providing a seamless, cost-effective solution.

Method: Combines Whisper for speech recognition, LLMs for segmentation and translation, and TTS with voice cloning for speech regeneration.

Result: The system offers real-time multilingual translation and speech regeneration with preserved speaker identity, suitable for diverse applications.

Conclusion: The open-source system demonstrates potential for inclusive, adaptable communication in multilingual scenarios, fostering innovation and accessibility.

Abstract: We present an open-source system designed for multilingual translation and
speech regeneration, addressing challenges in communication and accessibility
across diverse linguistic contexts. The system integrates Whisper for speech
recognition with Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to identify speaking intervals,
followed by a pipeline of Large Language Models (LLMs). For multilingual
applications, the first LLM segments speech into coherent, complete sentences,
which a second LLM then translates. For speech regeneration, the system uses a
text-to-speech (TTS) module with voice cloning capabilities to replicate the
original speaker's voice, maintaining naturalness and speaker identity.
  The system's open-source components can operate locally or via APIs, offering
cost-effective deployment across various use cases. These include real-time
multilingual translation in Zoom sessions, speech regeneration for public
broadcasts, and Bluetooth-enabled multilingual playback through personal
devices. By preserving the speaker's voice, the system ensures a seamless and
immersive experience, whether translating or regenerating speech.
  This open-source project is shared with the community to foster innovation
and accessibility. We provide a detailed system performance analysis, including
latency and word accuracy, demonstrating its potential to enable inclusive,
adaptable communication solutions in real-world multilingual scenarios.

*Yuzhu Wang, Archontis Politis, Konstantinos Drossos, Tuomas Virtanen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of applying DNN-based speech separation to long recordings by proposing a Frequency-Temporal RNN (FTRNN) that avoids segmentation issues and preserves speaker association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DNN models for speech separation are trained on short segments but struggle with longer real-world recordings.

Method: The FTRNN uses a full-band module for frequency dependencies and a sub-band module for temporal patterns, enabling long-audio processing without segmentation.

Result: FTRNN performs robustly on longer audio (21-121 s) despite being trained on 10 s segments, preserving speaker association and avoiding boundary distortions.

Conclusion: FTRNN offers a lightweight, effective solution for multi-utterance speech separation and speaker association in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Current deep neural network (DNN) based speech separation faces a fundamental
challenge -- while the models need to be trained on short segments due to
computational constraints, real-world applications typically require processing
significantly longer recordings with multiple utterances per speaker than seen
during training. In this paper, we investigate how existing approaches perform
in this challenging scenario and propose a frequency-temporal recurrent neural
network (FTRNN) that effectively bridges this gap. Our FTRNN employs a
full-band module to model frequency dependencies within each time frame and a
sub-band module that models temporal patterns in each frequency band. Despite
being trained on short fixed-length segments of 10 s, our model demonstrates
robust separation when processing signals significantly longer than training
segments (21-121 s) and preserves speaker association across utterance gaps
exceeding those seen during training. Unlike the conventional
segment-separation-stitch paradigm, our lightweight approach (0.9 M parameters)
performs inference on long audio without segmentation, eliminating segment
boundary distortions while simplifying deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate the generalization ability of FTRNN for multi-utterance speech
separation and speaker association.

*Caleb Rascon, Luis Gato-Diaz, Eduardo Garc√≠a-Alarc√≥n*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A multi-agent system (MASA) is proposed for parallel auditory scene analysis (ASA) with feedback loops to reduce errors and response time, making it viable for low-complexity applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear ASA tasks increase response time and error sensitivity, making them unsuitable for applications requiring low computational footprint and fast response.

Method: A multi-agent approach runs ASA tasks (location, separation, classification) in parallel with feedback loops to correct errors (e.g., using separation quality to adjust location).

Result: The MASA system is robust against errors, maintains low complexity, and reduces response time.

Conclusion: MASA offers a viable alternative for ASA in applications like bioacoustics and human-robot interaction, with open-source tools for extensibility.

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

TL;DR: DeSTA2.5-Audio is a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) that avoids task-specific tuning by using a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy, preserving language abilities while excelling in audio-text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in LALMs and enable robust auditory perception without task-specific tuning.

Method: Proposes DeSTA, a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy where the LLM generates its own training targets, and constructs DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior auditory perception and instruction-following.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of data construction in LALM development and provides insights for building general-purpose LALMs.

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

*Jakob Kienegger, Alina Mannanova, Huajian Fang, Timo Gerkmann*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel low-complexity particle filter strategy improves tracking accuracy and speech enhancement in dynamic scenarios, outperforming resource-intensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead of data-driven tracking algorithms in dynamic scenarios, enabling real-time speech enhancement in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Uses a low-complexity particle filter with temporal feedback from the enhanced speech signal of a spatially selective filter for improved tracking.

Result: Drastically improves tracking accuracy and enhancement performance, validated on synthetic data and real-world recordings.

Conclusion: The proposed self-steering pipeline is preferred over comparable methods, offering efficient performance in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

*You Zhang, Andrew Francl, Ruohan Gao, Paul Calamia, Zhiyao Duan, Ishwarya Ananthabhotla*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a perception-informed latent space method for HRTF personalization, improving auditory realism by aligning latent representations with perceptual distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HRTF latent spaces optimize for spectral reconstruction, not perceptual compatibility, potentially misaligning with perceptual distance.

Method: The study evaluates traditional HRTF representations using perceptual metrics, then introduces a perception-informed latent space using metric-based loss and MMDS supervision.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates applicability to HRTF personalization, enhancing spatial audio realism.

Conclusion: The perception-informed approach improves personalized spatial audio, promising a better listening experience.

Abstract: Personalized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are essential for
ensuring a realistic auditory experience over headphones, because they take
into account individual anatomical differences that affect listening. Most
machine learning approaches to HRTF personalization rely on a learned
low-dimensional latent space to generate or select custom HRTFs for a listener.
However, these latent representations are typically learned in a manner that
optimizes for spectral reconstruction but not for perceptual compatibility,
meaning they may not necessarily align with perceptual distance. In this work,
we first study whether traditionally learned HRTF representations are well
correlated with perceptual relations using auditory-based objective perceptual
metrics; we then propose a method for explicitly embedding HRTFs into a
perception-informed latent space, leveraging a metric-based loss function and
supervision via Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MMDS). Finally, we demonstrate
the applicability of these learned representations to the task of HRTF
personalization. We suggest that our method has the potential to render
personalized spatial audio, leading to an improved listening experience.

*Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a method to improve SSL for Speaker Verification by sampling diverse positives, reducing channel bias, and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL frameworks for SV rely on anchor-positive pairs from the same utterance, encoding too much recording-source information, limiting performance.

Method: SSPS samples positives close to anchors in representation space, assuming they share speaker identity but differ in recording conditions.

Result: SSPS improves SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks, with SimCLR and DINO achieving ~2.5% EER and SimCLR showing a 58% relative EER reduction.

Conclusion: SSPS enhances SSL for SV by reducing intra-class variance and channel bias, achieving robust performance even without data-augmentation.

Abstract: Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated
significant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the
performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. SSL
frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs, constructed from segments of the same
audio utterance. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those
of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation.
Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it
encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned
representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling
(SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives
in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the
representation space, assuming that these pseudo-positives belong to the same
speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method
consistently demonstrates improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks
when applied to major SSL frameworks, including SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO.
Using SSPS, SimCLR and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O,
respectively. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable
performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers
intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations
while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.

Motivation: To enhance the quality of cine cardiac MRI by translating artifact-prone DENSE sequences into high-contrast, dynamic videos for better clinical analysis.

Method: Uses a Latent Temporal Multi-Attention (LTMA) registration network for accurate motion learning and a multi-level diffusion model with Spatio-Temporal Motion Encoder (STME) for improved synthesis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, with synthesized videos enhancing downstream clinical tasks.

Conclusion: MFD-V2V effectively translates DENSE sequences to high-quality cine CMR, demonstrating clinical utility and broader impact.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel motion feature guided diffusion model for
unpaired video-to-video translation (MFD-V2V), designed to synthesize dynamic,
high-contrast cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) from lower-contrast,
artifact-prone displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) CMR
sequences. To achieve this, we first introduce a Latent Temporal

accurate and consistent cardiac motions from cine CMR image videos. A
multi-level motion feature guided diffusion model, equipped with a specialized
Spatio-Temporal Motion Encoder (STME) to extract fine-grained motion
conditioning, is then developed to improve synthesis quality and fidelity. We
evaluate our method, MFD-V2V, on a comprehensive cardiac dataset, demonstrating
superior performance over the state-of-the-art in both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Furthermore, we show the benefits of our synthesized
cine CMRs improving downstream clinical and analytical tasks, underscoring the

TL;DR: CineMyoPS is a deep neural network that segments myocardial scars and edema from cine CMR images, leveraging motion and anatomy features with a consistency loss and time-series aggregation for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major global health concern. While LGE and T2-weighted CMR are effective for identifying scars and edema, they are time-consuming and require contrast agents. Cine CMR offers a faster, contrast-free alternative.

Method: CineMyoPS uses an end-to-end deep neural network to extract motion and anatomy features from cine CMR. It employs a consistency loss for joint learning and a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate features across the cardiac cycle.

Result: CineMyoPS shows promising performance in segmenting myocardial pathologies, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation on a multi-center dataset.

Conclusion: CineMyoPS provides a viable, contrast-free solution for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment using cine CMR, reducing reliance on time-consuming multi-sequence imaging.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (FC-DLIF) predicts arterial input functions from PET imaging, eliminating invasive blood sampling in small-animal studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arterial blood sampling in small animals is invasive and terminal, hindering longitudinal studies. A non-invasive alternative is needed.

Method: FC-DLIF uses convolutional networks to extract spatial and temporal features from PET data to predict input functions.

Result: FC-DLIF reliably predicts input functions, handles temporal shifts, but fails with untrained radiotracers.

Conclusion: FC-DLIF offers a robust, non-invasive alternative to blood sampling, though limited by training data diversity.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

*Zhurong Chen, Jinhua Chen, Wei Zhuo, Wufeng Xue, Dong Ni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework reconstructs 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices, improving LV and RV volume estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography's 2D limitations and 3D ultrasound's resolution issues necessitate better methods for accurate heart volume estimation.

Method: An innovative 3D reconstruction pipeline optimizes pose estimation and integration of 2D slices using an implicit neural network.

Result: Significant improvement in LV volume estimation (1.98% error vs. 20.24%) and breakthrough RV volume estimation (5.75% error).

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising approach for personalized 3D heart analysis in clinical practice.

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: MEGANet-W improves colorectal polyp segmentation by using wavelet-driven edge guidance, outperforming existing methods without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak and low-contrast boundaries in colorectal polyp images limit automated segmentation accuracy, and current methods either blur details or rely on unreliable handcrafted filters.

Method: Proposes MEGANet-W, which uses Haar wavelet edge maps and WEGA modules to guide attention and recalibrate features without additional parameters.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on five datasets, improving mIoU by 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%.

Conclusion: MEGANet-W effectively addresses edge detail issues in polyp segmentation, offering a parameter-free solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalence of kidney disease and the limitations of deep learning models (e.g., data scarcity, high computational costs) drive the need for transfer learning to enhance diagnostics.

Method: Systematic review of transfer learning methodologies in deep learning for kidney cancer detection, analyzing frameworks, performance, and challenges.

Result: Transfer learning improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces computational demands, and supports AI integration in healthcare, demonstrating its transformative role in precision medicine.

Conclusion: The review provides insights for researchers and practitioners, guiding future advances in kidney cancer diagnostics and personalized treatment.

Abstract: Incurable diseases continue to pose major challenges to global healthcare
systems, with their prevalence shaped by lifestyle, economic, social, and
genetic factors. Among these, kidney disease remains a critical global health
issue, requiring ongoing research to improve early diagnosis and treatment. In
recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown promise in medical imaging and
diagnostics, driving significant progress in automatic kidney cancer (KC)
detection. However, the success of DL models depends heavily on the
availability of high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which are often limited
and expensive to acquire. Moreover, DL models demand substantial computational
power and storage, restricting their real-world clinical use. To overcome these
barriers, transfer learning (TL) has emerged as an effective approach, enabling
the reuse of pre-trained models from related domains to enhance KC diagnosis.
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for KC
detection, systematically reviewing key methodologies, their advantages, and
limitations, and analyzing their practical performance. It further discusses
challenges in applying TL to medical imaging and highlights emerging trends
that could influence future research. This review demonstrates the
transformative role of TL in precision medicine, particularly oncology, by
improving diagnostic accuracy, lowering computational demands, and supporting
the integration of AI-powered tools in healthcare. The insights provided offer
valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners, paving the way for future
advances in KC diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.

*Carlo Alberto Barbano, Matteo Brunello, Benoit Dufumier, Marco Grangetto*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AnatCL is an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that uses weakly contrastive learning with anatomical information, achieving state-of-the-art results across 12 downstream tasks and 10 clinical assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity and improve representation learning in neuroimaging, leveraging anatomical information for pre-training DL models.

Method: Proposes AnatCL, a weakly contrastive learning approach incorporating anatomical data (e.g., cortical thickness) for pre-training.

Result: Achieves top performance in diagnosing conditions like Alzheimer's and autism, and predicts clinical scores robustly.

Conclusion: Anatomical pre-training enhances model generalizability and robustness for diverse neuroimaging tasks.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for
detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the
most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which
has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as
Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL
models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results,
especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the
other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can
provide important information for learning good representations that can be
transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an
anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical
information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves
state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To
validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the
diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum
disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10
different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings
show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to
more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained models can be found

*Zhe Xiong, Qiaoqiao Ding, Xiaoqun Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel flow-based model, Bi-DPM, is proposed for bi-modality medical image synthesis, outperforming existing methods by using bi-directional ODE flows and ensuring high-quality results with fewer time steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image synthesis is valuable for clinical diagnostics and data augmentation, but existing flow-based models suffer from heavy computation due to numerous time iterations.

Method: Bi-DPM uses forward and backward ODE flows, enhancing consistency in intermediate images over discrete time steps for high-quality synthesis of both modalities.

Result: Experiments on MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI datasets show Bi-DPM surpasses state-of-the-art methods, producing higher-quality images with accurate anatomical details.

Conclusion: Bi-DPM is an efficient and effective solution for bi-modality medical image synthesis, addressing computational limitations while maintaining superior image quality.

Abstract: Recently, medical image synthesis gains more and more popularity, along with
the rapid development of generative models. Medical image synthesis aims to
generate an unacquired image modality, often from other observed data
modalities. Synthesized images can be used for clinical diagnostic assistance,
data augmentation for model training and validation or image quality improving.
In the meanwhile, the flow-based models are among the successful generative
models for the ability of generating realistic and high-quality synthetic
images. However, most flow-based models require to calculate flow ordinary
different equation (ODE) evolution steps in synthesis process, for which the
performances are significantly limited by heavy computation time due to a large
number of time iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based model,
namely bi-directional Discrete Process Matching (Bi-DPM) to accomplish the
bi-modality image synthesis tasks. Different to other flow matching based
models, we propose to utilize both forward and backward ODE flows and enhance
the consistency on the intermediate images over a few discrete time steps,
resulting in a synthesis process maintaining high-quality generations for both
modalities under the guidance of paired data. Our experiments on three datasets
of MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI demonstrate that Bi-DPM outperforms other
state-of-the-art flow-based methods for bi-modality image synthesis, delivering
higher image quality with accurate anatomical regions.

TL;DR: A novel method using Wasserstein distance for illumination estimation outperforms traditional techniques in complex lighting scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust illumination estimation is crucial for robotics and image processing, especially under varying lighting conditions where traditional methods fail.

Method: Utilizes Wasserstein distance from optimal transport theory to estimate illuminant and light direction in images.

Result: Outperforms traditional statistical methods in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions across diverse image types.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for applications like light source localization and image quality assessment, with future research suggested for further accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing,
particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential
under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB
histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their
sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method
utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to
estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse
images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate
the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their
directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting
environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source
localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement.
Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient
analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world
illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates bias mitigation in AI-based CMR segmentation models, focusing on ethnicity bias between Black and White subjects. Oversampling and cropped images are effective in reducing bias without compromising majority group performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the reported ethnicity bias in AI models for CMR image segmentation and evaluating the effectiveness of bias mitigation techniques.

Method: Uses oversampling, importance reweighing, Group DRO, and cropped images to mitigate bias. Evaluates performance on underrepresented and majority groups.

Result: Oversampling improves performance for Black subjects without harming White subjects. Cropped images enhance performance for both groups and reduce bias. External validation shows high performance and no significant bias.

Conclusion: Effective bias mitigation is achievable with oversampling and cropped images, ensuring equitable AI performance in medical imaging.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for medical imaging
tasks. However, there can be biases in AI models, particularly when they are
trained using imbalanced training datasets. One such example has been the
strong ethnicity bias effect in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image
segmentation models. Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of
publications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation
algorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias
mitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based
CMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance
reweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to
mitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root
causes of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using
models trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be
mitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the
underrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority
White subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for
both ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias
mitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing
the models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation
performance and no statistically significant bias.

TL;DR: A novel alternating minimization framework using a diffusion model to correct motion artifacts in MRI by jointly reconstructing and correcting k-space data, tested on cardiac MRI and simulated deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is prone to motion artifacts due to long acquisition times, compromising diagnostic utility, especially in dynamic imaging.

Method: Proposes an alternating minimization framework with a diffusion model for coarse-to-fine denoising, focusing on large motion and lower frequencies first.

Result: Effective on cardiac MRI and simulated deformations, even with 64x undersampling, and adaptable to various sampling patterns and protocols.

Conclusion: The method robustly addresses motion artifacts in MRI, offering flexibility and high performance under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts
due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These
artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging.
We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke
diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted
k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to
capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image
first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of
standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on
both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and
non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor
of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical
variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency
components are sampled during each motion state.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel variational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) is proposed for MRI bias field correction, combining Hadamard transforms and variational inference to improve image quality and downstream tasks like segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias field artifacts in MRI scans degrade image quality and hinder analysis, necessitating an effective correction method.

Method: VHU-Net uses convolutional Hadamard transform blocks (ConvHTBlocks) for frequency decomposition and noise suppression, with an inverse HT-reconstructed transformer block for global attention. Variational inference ensures sparsity and accuracy.

Result: VHU-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in uniformity, fidelity, and contrast, and improves segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: VHU-Net is efficient, interpretable, and robust, suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Bias field artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans introduce
spatially smooth intensity inhomogeneities that degrade image quality and
hinder downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
variational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) for effective body MRI bias field
correction. The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform
blocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard
transform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise
frequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent
scaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant
high-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model
inter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse
HT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention
for the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder
ConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying
ground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference,
we formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective,
promoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field
estimation. Comprehensive experiments on abdominal and prostate MRI datasets
demonstrate the superiority of VHU-Net over existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of intensity uniformity, signal fidelity, and tissue contrast.
Moreover, the corrected images yield substantial downstream improvements in
segmentation accuracy. Our framework offers computational efficiency,
interpretability, and robust performance across multi-center datasets, making
it suitable for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: Proposes MTCNet for 4D mitral valve ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning, addressing challenges like limited annotations and motion artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack inter-phase dependency, hindering accurate 4D mitral valve analysis.

Method: Uses cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning and topology-guided correlation regularization for anatomically plausible segmentation.

Result: Achieves superior performance (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm) on a large dataset.

Conclusion: MTCNet effectively leverages structural correspondence and outperforms advanced methods.

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at
https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.
