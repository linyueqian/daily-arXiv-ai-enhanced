Domain\nGeneralization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with\nstrong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG\nmethods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following\nlimitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their\nexclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse\neffects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style\naugmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.\nSpecifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,\nallowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data\ndomains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative\neffects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior\ngeneralization performance.

To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By\ntransforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the\ntraining process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be\nresolution-agnostic.

A more efficient solution\ninvolves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified\nmodel. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to\ndestructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual\ngeneralization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this\nchallenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework\ndesigned to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core\ninnovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for\neach language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.\nThis approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving\nmultilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation\nacross three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,\ndemonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models\nwithin a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs\nstructured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of\nmanufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the\nreference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three\nhierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error\nanalysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the\nreference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these\npatches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based\nprimitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point\nclouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine\nthe coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on\ncircular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a\ntwo-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,\nedge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple\ncircles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring\naccurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results\non various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.", "AI": {"tldr": "A hierarchical error assessment framework (HEA-MM) for aircraft CAD models is proposed, using structured light scanners and multi-level error analysis (global, part, feature) to ensure high-quality manufacturing.", "motivation": "Ensuring high quality in aviation equipment (performance, stability, reliability) requires precise error assessment in CAD models during manufacturing.", "method": "HEA-MM uses structured light scanners for 3D measurements, registers point clouds with CAD models, and performs error analysis at global, part, and feature levels.

The study begins by merging\ntransactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a\nrelational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature\nengineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,\ndeviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and\ncategory frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers\nsuch as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns\nthat indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals\ncontextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the\ntransactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:\nIsolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct\nnormal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as\noutliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate\nanomalies into a two-dimensional latent space.

Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,\ncomputation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a\ntechnical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the\nmodel's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not\nefficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching\nLRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address\nthe data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through\nHint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate\npositions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality\nsamples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,\nwith supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\\%\nand 8\\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging\nmathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about\n30\\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model\ncompared with the natural language models.
