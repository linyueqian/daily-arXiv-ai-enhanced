### [1] [Table Understanding and (Multimodal) LLMs: A Cross-Domain Case Study on Scientific vs. Non-Scientific Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00152)
*Ekaterina Borisova, Fabio Barth, Nils Feldhus, Raia Abu Ahmad, Malte Ostendorff, Pedro Ortiz Suarez, Georg Rehm, Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' efficiency in processing tabular data, comparing text-based and multimodal models across domains and modalities, and introduces the TableEval benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' effectiveness in table understanding tasks, particularly across scientific and non-scientific contexts and different table representations.

Method: Cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation of LLMs, including interpretability analysis, using the TableEval benchmark with 3017 tables in five formats.

Result: LLMs show robustness across table modalities but struggle with scientific tables.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' limitations in handling scientific tabular data and introduces a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

### [2] [Prompting as Scientific Inquiry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00163)
*Ari Holtzman, Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompting is a crucial and scientifically valid method for studying and controlling large language models (LLMs), akin to behavioral science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to legitimize prompting as a scientific method for understanding and interacting with LLMs, countering its perception as unreliable or unscientific.

Method: The authors argue for treating prompting as behavioral science, comparing it to mechanistic interpretability but focusing on language as the native interface for LLMs.

Result: The paper asserts that prompting is not inferior but essential for unlocking and studying LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Prompting should be recognized as a fundamental component of LLM science, not dismissed as alchemy.

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language
models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability
attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

### [3] [LineRetriever: Planning-Aware Observation Reduction for Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00210)
*Imene Kerboua, Sahar Omidi Shayegan, Megh Thakkar, Xing Han Lù, Massimo Caccia, Véronique Eglin, Alexandre Aussem, Jérémy Espinas, Alexandre Lacoste*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LineRetriever, a method to optimize retrieval for adaptive planning in web navigation by prioritizing observation lines relevant to future actions, addressing context limits of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods lose critical information for adaptive planning in web navigation due to context limits of models, necessitating a solution that retains plan-relevant details.

Method: LineRetriever uses a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to future navigation steps, focusing on planning horizon rather than just semantic similarity.

Result: LineRetriever reduces observation size while maintaining performance within context limits, demonstrating effectiveness in web navigation tasks.

Conclusion: LineRetriever offers a viable solution to optimize retrieval for adaptive planning in web navigation, addressing the limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web
navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

### [4] [TransLaw: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Multi-Agent Simulation of the Collaborative Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00875)
*Xi Xuan, King-kui Sin, Yufei Zhou, Chunyu Kit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransLaw is a multi-agent framework using LLMs for translating Hong Kong legal judgments, outperforming GPT-4 in accuracy but lagging behind humans in nuanced aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The uncertainty of LLMs in translating legal texts due to complex terminology and cultural nuances motivates the development of TransLaw.

Method: TransLaw employs three specialized agents (Translator, Annotator, Proofreader) for collaborative translation, supporting customizable LLM configurations.

Result: The framework surpasses GPT-4 in legal semantic accuracy and coherence but trails human experts in nuanced terminology and style.

Conclusion: TransLaw demonstrates cost-effective, high-accuracy legal translation, though human expertise remains superior for nuanced aspects.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream
applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in
translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such
as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict
linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent
framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs
three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to
collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,
appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.
This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous
cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We
evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents
and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal
semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails
human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.
Our platform website is available at CityUHK, and our bilingual judgment corpus
used for the evaluation is available at Hugging Face.

### [5] [Two-Stage Reasoning-Infused Learning: Improving Classification with LLM-Generated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00214)
*Mads Henrichsen, Rasmus Krebs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage approach enhances text classification by using LLM-generated reasoning, improving accuracy by 8.7% over a baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard models lack explicit reasoning, limiting performance and interpretability. This work aims to improve both by incorporating LLM-generated reasoning.

Method: 1. Fine-tune Llama-R-Gen on a reasoning dataset. 2. Use it to create an augmented dataset for a downstream model, trained to output reasoning and labels.

Result: The model (Q->RA) outperforms the baseline (Q->A) by 8.7% in accuracy on emotion classification.

Conclusion: LLM-generated reasoning enriches training data, boosting performance and providing interpretability for NLP tasks.

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

### [6] [Towards Style Alignment in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00216)
*Shreya Havaldar, Adam Stein, Eric Wong, Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RASTA improves LLM translation by aligning speaker and listener styles, addressing cultural misalignment and bias towards neutrality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cultural differences often cause misalignment in communication styles, such as politeness being lost in translation. LLMs exacerbate this by biasing translations towards neutrality and underperforming in non-Western languages.

Method: RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic Alignment) uses learned stylistic concepts to align LLM translations with cultural norms.

Result: RASTA mitigates style misalignment, improving translation accuracy for cultural communication norms.

Conclusion: RASTA effectively addresses LLM shortcomings in style translation, enhancing cross-cultural communication.

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

### [7] [Linearly Decoding Refused Knowledge in Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00239)
*Aryan Shrivastava, Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Linear probes on LM hidden states reveal that refused harmful information remains accessible and influential post-instruction-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if harmful information refused by instruction-tuned LMs is still decodable and influential in their behavior.

Method: Use linear probes trained on LM hidden states to decode initially refused information, testing transferability between base and instruction-tuned models.

Result: Probes achieve high accuracy (Pearson correlations >0.8), showing refused information is linearly accessible and aligns with suppressed generative behavior.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning suppresses but does not eliminate harmful information, leaving it linearly decodable and indirectly influential.

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

### [8] [The Algebraic Structure of Morphosyntax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00244)
*Isabella Senturia, Matilde Marcolli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A mathematical model of the morphology-syntax interface is presented, using magma and operad theory to describe word formation and morphosyntactic tree construction without movement in morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the interface between morphology and syntax under the Strong Minimalist Thesis, addressing how word formation and syntactic structure interact mathematically.

Method: Uses magma for morphological trees and operad theory for morphosyntactic trees, introducing a coproduct decomposition and transformations inspired by Distributed Morphology.

Result: A framework where morphological and syntactic data are paired via operadic correspondence, allowing flexible boundary shifts between syntax and morphology.

Conclusion: The model successfully integrates morphology and syntax mathematically, providing a formal basis for understanding their interface and flexibility.

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

*Sanchit Ahuja, Praneetha Vaddamanu, Barun Patra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Non-English languages can be more token-efficient for reasoning in language models, preserving accuracy and showing genuine shifts in reasoning behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if English is the most token-efficient language for reasoning, given that most research focuses on English despite multilingual pretraining.

Method: Evaluated three open-source RLMs (DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, Qwen 3) across four math datasets and seven diverse languages.

Result: Non-English reasoning reduces token usage and preserves accuracy, with gains persisting even after translation. Improvement depends on model multilingual strength.

Conclusion: Multilingual reasoning has potential, and strong multilingual foundations are important for language models.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research
focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on
multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

### [10] [Impact of Fine-Tuning Methods on Memorization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00258)
*Jie Hou, Chuxiong Wu, Lannan Luo, Qiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt-based fine-tuning is more privacy-preserving than parameter-based fine-tuning, showing lower vulnerability to membership inference attacks (MIAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked privacy risks of memorization during fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs).

Method: Categorize fine-tuning approaches and evaluate their memorization impact using membership inference attacks (MIAs).

Result: Prompt-based fine-tuning performs competitively and is less vulnerable to MIAs, regardless of model scale.

Conclusion: Parameter-based fine-tuning leaks more private information, making prompt-based methods a better privacy-preserving choice.

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

### [11] [Natural language processing for African languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00297)
*David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in NLP for low-resource African languages, focusing on data quality, multilingual models, and creating labeled datasets for tasks like named entity recognition and machine translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve NLP performance for underrepresented African languages by addressing data noise, lack of labeled datasets, and leveraging multilingual models.

Method: Analyze noise in corpora, curate high-quality data, adapt multilingual PLMs, and create labeled datasets for 21 African languages.

Result: Demonstrates the importance of data quality over quantity for word embeddings and the effectiveness of multilingual PLMs for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The work highlights opportunities for adapting multilingual models to African languages and provides valuable labeled datasets to advance NLP research in underrepresented regions.

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

### [12] [Failure by Interference: Language Models Make Balanced Parentheses Errors When Faulty Mechanisms Overshadow Sound Ones](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00322)
*Daking Rai, Samuel Miller, Kevin Moran, Ziyu Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMs struggle with syntactic tasks like balanced parentheses. The study identifies faulty and sound mechanisms in LMs and introduces RASteer to boost reliable components, improving accuracy from 0% to ~100%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate persistent syntactic errors in LMs despite their advanced coding capabilities.

Method: Analyze LM components (attention heads, FF neurons) and introduce RASteer to enhance reliable mechanisms.

Result: RASteer improves balanced parentheses accuracy to ~100% and arithmetic reasoning by ~20%.

Conclusion: Targeting reliable components in LMs can significantly enhance performance without harming general abilities.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

### [13] [Modeling Data Diversity for Joint Instance and Verbalizer Selection in Cold-Start Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00330)
*Mohna Chakraborty, Adithya Kulkarni, Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COLDSELECT improves prompt-based methods by jointly selecting verbalizers and instances, optimizing for diversity and minimal uncertainty, outperforming baselines in cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and instance selection, especially in cold-start settings. The dependency between instances and verbalizers is overlooked.

Method: COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and embeddings into a shared space, uses dimensionality reduction and clustering for efficient, diverse selection, optimizing for minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmarks show COLDSELECT reduces uncertainty and enhances generalization, outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection.

Conclusion: COLDSELECT effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by modeling data diversity and dependencies, improving performance in cold-start scenarios.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

### [14] [Question Decomposition for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00355)
*Paul J. L. Ammann, Jonas Golde, Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a RAG pipeline with question decomposition and reranking to improve retrieval and answer accuracy for multi-hop questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG struggles with multi-hop questions due to distributed facts across documents.

Method: Decompose queries into sub-questions, retrieve passages for each, merge and rerank the pool.

Result: Improves retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy (F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG.

Conclusion: Question decomposition and reranking enhance RAG for multi-hop questions without extra training.

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

### [15] [Gregorian melody, modality, and memory: Segmenting chant with Bayesian nonparametrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00380)
*Vojtěch Lanz, Jan Hajič jr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the idea of centonisation in Gregorian chant melodies, using unsupervised segmentation with Pitman-Yor models to achieve state-of-the-art mode classification, but finds the results don't fully align with traditional centonisation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test the centonisation theory in Gregorian chant by leveraging memory-based segmentation, given its historical memorization and observed melodic re-use.

Method: Uses nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language models for unsupervised segmentation of chant melodies, modeling a monk's memorization process.

Result: Achieves top performance in mode classification and identifies formulaic areas in melodies, but the segmentation doesn't match traditional centonisation.

Conclusion: Memory-optimal segmentation supports mode classification but doesn't validate centonisation, suggesting the theory may not fully explain chant construction.

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality
in performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that
even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as
centonisation.

### [16] [Causal Prompting for Implicit Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00389)
*Jing Ren, Wenhao Zhou, Bowen Li, Mujie Liu, Nguyen Linh Dan Le, Jiade Cen, Liping Chen, Ziqi Xu, Xiwei Xu, Xiaodong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAPITAL is a causal prompting framework for Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) that improves accuracy and robustness by integrating front-door adjustment into chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases and spurious correlations in prompting-based ISA methods by ensuring causal validity in reasoning paths.

Method: CAPITAL decomposes causal effects into prompt influence and reasoning impact, using encoder-based clustering, NWGM approximation, and contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy and robustness on ISA datasets, especially under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: CAPITAL provides a principled, bias-aware approach for causal inference in LLM prompting, enhancing sentiment reasoning.

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,

*Gauri Kambhatla, Sanjana Gautam, Angela Zhang, Alex Liu, Ravi Srinivasan, Junyi Jessy Li, Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Simple supervision improves language model alignment with diverse population groups, evaluated across datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of subjective question responses across diverse groups is valuable.

Method: Use of simple supervision to align language models with diverse groups, evaluated over multiple datasets and models.

Result: Improved alignment with diverse groups, with findings on when to use the approach.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, general, and provides a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would
answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that
use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model
alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets
spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report
how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of
our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful
guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting
evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing
our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

*Md. Najib Hasan, Mohammad Fakhruddin Babar, Souvika Sarkar, Monowar Hasan, Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open LLM benchmarks like HELM and BIG-bench enable fair LM comparisons but are vulnerable to exploitation, as shown by 'cheating' models that rank highly without real-world utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the pitfalls of open benchmarks, which can be gamed by models fine-tuned on public test sets, undermining their reliability.

Method: Constructed smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned on public test sets to exploit open benchmarks like HELM.

Result: These 'cheating' models achieved top rankings on HELM despite poor generalization, revealing flaws in open benchmarks.

Conclusion: Open benchmarks alone are insufficient; private/dynamic benchmarks and reevaluated practices are needed for trustworthy LM assessments.

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

*To Eun Kim, João Coelho, Gbemileke Onilude, Jai Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular pipeline for managing ads in RAG-based conversational systems, focusing on seamless integration and detection using synthetic data and classifier-guided strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of ads in generative search systems blurs boundaries between content and promotions, raising transparency and trust concerns.

Method: A pipeline with an ad-rewriter and ad-classifier is developed, using synthetic data for training and two ad-integration strategies: fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling.

Result: The ad-classifier shows robust detection performance, and classifier-guided optimization improves ad stealth.

Conclusion: The work contributes a framework for ad-aware generative systems and robust ad classifiers, balancing commercial and user experience needs.

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,
through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad
stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Nirantar is a framework for evaluating continual learning in multilingual and multi-domain ASR, using real-world data from 22 languages and 208 districts in India. It introduces novel scenarios like LIDIL and highlights the inconsistency of current CL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic evaluation frameworks for continual learning in multilingual and multi-domain ASR, Nirantar leverages real-world data to reflect dynamic, non-uniform shifts.

Method: Nirantar uses 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including 1720 newly introduced hours, to evaluate CL methods across LIL, DIL, and LIDIL scenarios.

Result: Existing CL methods perform inconsistently, showing no single approach is robust across all scenarios.

Conclusion: Nirantar provides a realistic testbed for CL research, emphasizing the need for more robust strategies.

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

*Shixiao Wang, Yifan Zhuang, Runsheng Zhang, Zhijun Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Capsule Network-based algorithm improves intent recognition accuracy in human-computer interaction by modeling semantic features hierarchically and using dynamic routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing insufficient accuracy in intent recognition for human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses vectorized capsule structures and dynamic routing to capture hierarchical semantic relationships, with a convolutional feature extraction module and margin-based loss function.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods and deep learning structures in accuracy, F1-score, and intent detection rate.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

Motivation: The opacity and lack of transparency in advanced computational algorithms undermine trust in research, necessitating methodological guidance.

Method: The author illustrates the structural topic modelling algorithm and presents guidelines for ensuring rigour in its application.

Result: The guidelines are useful for novice researchers, editors, and reviewers, and can be adapted for other algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the literature on topic modelling and methodological rigour in computationally intensive research.

Abstract: The rise of advanced computational algorithms has opened new avenues for
computationally intensive research approaches to theory development. However,
the opacity of these algorithms and lack of transparency and rigour in their
application pose methodological challenges, potentially undermining trust in
research. The discourse on methodological rigour in this new genre of research
is still emerging. Against this backdrop, I attempt to offer guidance on
methodological rigour, particularly in the context of topic modelling
algorithms. By illustrating the application of the structural topic modelling
algorithm and presenting a set of guidelines, I discuss how to ensure rigour in
topic modelling studies. Although the guidelines are for the application of
topic modelling algorithms, they can be applied to other algorithms with
context-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice
researchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic
modelling manuscripts. I contribute to the literature on topic modelling and
join the emerging dialogue on methodological rigour in computationally

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder trustworthiness, especially in multilingual contexts, which are often overlooked in research.

Method: Proposes a pipeline with retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia and a BERT-based system fine-tuned to detect hallucination patterns.

Result: Competitive performance across languages, top-10 in eight languages, and support for languages beyond the task's scope.

Conclusion: The multilingual hallucination identifier enhances LLM outputs and their future utility.

Abstract: Hallucinations are one of the major problems of LLMs, hindering their
trustworthiness and deployment to wider use cases. However, most of the
research on hallucinations focuses on English data, neglecting the multilingual
nature of LLMs. This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2025 Task-3
- Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related
Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. We propose a two-part pipeline that
combines retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia with a BERT-based
system fine-tuned to identify common hallucination patterns. Our system
achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in
eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages
beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination
identifier can help to improve LLM outputs and their usefulness in the future.

*Shuangquan Lyu, Yingnan Deng, Guiran Liu, Zhen Qi, Ruotong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework combining knowledge transfer and parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves adaptation of large language models in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of large language models in low-resource language settings.

Method: Uses knowledge alignment loss, soft prompt tuning, lightweight adaptation modules, freezing strategies, and prompt injection.

Result: Outperforms existing models and methods in cross-lingual tasks like MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X, especially in data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: The method enhances adaptability and preserves general capabilities, making it suitable for multilingual and complex semantic tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of
large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified
framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft
prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural
features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances
both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes
lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,
it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's
original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also
conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer
experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and
robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that
compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer
methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on
cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates
particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The
proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances
task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large
language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and
multilingual processing tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on task-specific prompts, limiting adaptability and efficiency. MoR aims to embed diverse reasoning strategies for autonomous task-adaptive reasoning.

Method: MoR involves two phases: Thought Generation (creating reasoning chain templates) and SFT Dataset Construction (pairing templates with datasets for supervised fine-tuning).

Result: MoR improves performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) over baselines.

Conclusion: MoR provides a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across tasks without task-specific prompts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances
performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting

TL;DR: SAFER is a framework using Sparse Autoencoders to interpret and improve reward models in RLHF, enabling insights into safety-relevant decisions and targeted data manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models in RLHF are opaque; SAFER aims to interpret and refine them for better alignment with human values.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoders to analyze reward model activations, identify safety-relevant features, and design data poisoning/denoising strategies.

Result: SAFER precisely degrades or enhances safety alignment with minimal data changes, without affecting general chat performance.

Conclusion: SAFER advances reward model interpretation, auditing, and refinement for high-stakes LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models
at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder
For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting
and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model
activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply
SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of
individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected
responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning
and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or
enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing
general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing
and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are
available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper

*Ahmed Sabir, Azinovič Gasper, Mengsay Loem, Rajesh Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs trained on Japanese and English exhibit culturally grounded attentional patterns, mirroring holistic (East Asian) and analytic (Western) tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if VLMs reflect cultural differences in visual information processing, similar to humans.

Method: Comparative analysis of image descriptions generated by VLMs trained on Japanese (holistic) and English (analytic).

Result: VLMs reproduce cultural behaviors, showing holistic vs. analytic tendencies based on training language.

Conclusion: Cultural cognition implicitly shapes VLM outputs, suggesting training data influences model behavior beyond language structure.

Abstract: Cross-cultural research in perception and cognition has shown that
individuals from different cultural backgrounds process visual information in
distinct ways. East Asians, for example, tend to adopt a holistic perspective,
attending to contextual relationships, whereas Westerners often employ an
analytical approach, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. In
this study, we investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained
predominantly on different languages, specifically Japanese and English,
exhibit similar culturally grounded attentional patterns. Using comparative
analysis of image descriptions, we examine whether these models reflect
differences in holistic versus analytic tendencies. Our findings suggest that
VLMs not only internalize the structural properties of language but also
reproduce cultural behaviors embedded in the training data, indicating that
cultural cognition may implicitly shape model outputs.

Motivation: To leverage LLMs for generating coherent and informative financial reports from time series data, while evaluating their factual grounding and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes a framework involving prompt engineering, model selection, and evaluation, with an automated highlighting system to categorize insights (data-derived, financial reasoning, or external knowledge).

Result: Experiments show LLMs can produce coherent and informative financial reports using real and synthetic time series data.

Conclusion: LLMs are capable of generating useful financial reports, with the proposed framework aiding in evaluating their reasoning and factual grounding.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate
financial reports from time series data. We propose a framework encompassing
prompt engineering, model selection, and evaluation. We introduce an automated
highlighting system to categorize information within the generated reports,
differentiating between insights derived directly from time series data,
stemming from financial reasoning, and those reliant on external knowledge.
This approach aids in evaluating the factual grounding and reasoning

TL;DR: LitBench is introduced as a standardized benchmark for evaluating creative writing by LLMs, identifying Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the best OTS judge and trained reward models outperforming OTS judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of ground truths in creative writing evaluation makes it challenging to assess LLM-generated content reliably.

Method: LitBench includes a dataset of human-labeled story comparisons, benchmarking zero-shot LLM judges, training reward models, and validating rankings via a human study.

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves 73% agreement with humans; trained reward models reach 78% accuracy.

Conclusion: LitBench provides a reliable resource for automated evaluation and optimization of creative writing systems.

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without
performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models
are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this
context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce
LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative
writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased,
human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training
corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot
LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii)
conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly
LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the
strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences;
among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both
attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online
human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align
with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and
reward models at

TL;DR: The paper reviews GenAI's use in scientometrics, discussing its potential and limitations, and calls for systematic comparisons and empirical work to adapt to its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GenAI's role in scientometrics and its broader implications, including its ability to mimic human reasoning and its impact on measuring science.

Method: The paper reviews GenAI's generative nature, critically engages with recent experiments in scientometrics, and discusses its potential impact on textual characteristics in science.

Result: GenAI excels in language generation tasks like labelling but struggles with stable semantics or domain knowledge. Its rapid evolution necessitates systematic model comparisons.

Conclusion: Empirical work and theoretical reflection are crucial to interpret GenAI's evolving impact on scientometrics and knowledge production.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to
begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an
introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in
distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to
which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this
distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in
scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,
predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI
shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,
but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic
reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become
quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to
systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific
tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific
language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting
textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and
references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection
will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of
knowledge production.

*Anita Keshmirian, Razan Baltaji, Babak Hemmatian, Hadi Asghari, Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in groups show a utilitarian boost in moral dilemmas, similar to humans, but the underlying mechanisms differ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs exhibit collective utilitarian reasoning like humans in moral dilemmas.

Method: Tested six LLM models in solo and group conditions on moral dilemmas, comparing responses.

Result: LLMs in groups found moral violations more acceptable, but the reasoning differed from humans.

Conclusion: LLM collective behavior mimics human group reasoning superficially, but the drivers are distinct, impacting AI alignment.

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social
reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to
understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to
individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a
utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits
for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar
dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on
well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where
models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn
discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must
decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all
models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than
individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that
maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar
individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.
However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their
utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from
heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced
norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface
behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying
drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent
design, and artificial moral reasoning.

TL;DR: A scalable human evaluation protocol and LLM-based proxy for topic model and document-clustering evaluations, validated as statistically indistinguishable from human annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for topic models and document clustering either misalign with human preferences or are impractical to scale.

Method: Design a human evaluation protocol where annotators (or an LLM proxy) infer categories for groups of documents and apply them to others. Validate proxies using crowdworker annotations.

Result: LLM-based proxies perform comparably to human annotators, making them suitable for automated evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol and LLM proxies offer a scalable and effective alternative to traditional evaluation methods.

Abstract: Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics
that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are
intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a
corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world
usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items
assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that
category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive
crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two
datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding
that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human
annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated
evaluations. Package, web interface, and data are at

TL;DR: The paper uses stylometry to differentiate between LLM-generated and human-written texts, achieving high accuracy with tree-based models and stylometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing model attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use by identifying emergent writing patterns in LLM-generated texts.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset with human and LLM-generated texts, applied tree-based models (decision trees, LightGBM) using stylometric features (lexical, grammatical, syntactic, punctuation).

Result: Achieved up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in multiclass and .79-1. accuracy in binary classification, with GPT-4 vs. Wikipedia reaching .98 accuracy.

Conclusion: Stylometry can effectively distinguish machine-generated from human-written texts for well-defined text types, even with sophisticated LLMs.

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts
created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model
attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been
used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.
By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing
patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,
with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs
(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text
summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods
(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models
(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and
n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,
grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results
reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the
multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary
classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up
to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed
features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused
words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to
human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the
increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-
from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

*Aditya Tomar, Nihar Ranjan Sahoo, Ashish Mittal, Rudra Murthy, Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines cultural bias in math problem presentation, adapting GSM8K for five regions and testing LLMs. Results show models perform best on US-centric data but reasoning-capable models handle cultural shifts better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cultural neutrality in math problem presentation, as existing benchmarks like GSM8K are Western-centric.

Method: Created culturally adapted GSM8K variants for five regions, evaluated six LLMs with five prompting strategies.

Result: Models perform best on US-centric data; reasoning-capable models are more resilient to cultural shifts.

Conclusion: Deeper reasoning helps mitigate cultural presentation gaps in math tasks.

Abstract: Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way
mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context.
Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms,
including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create
culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa,
India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by
manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from
8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their
robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings
reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original
US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions.
However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts,
suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in
mathematical tasks

### [36] [Scaling Laws Are Unreliable for Downstream Tasks: A Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00885)
*Nicholas Lourie, Michael Y. Hu, Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Downstream scaling laws predict task performance from pretraining losses, but linear trends are rare (39% cases) and sensitive to experimental changes. Understanding conditions for scaling laws is crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether downstream scaling laws can reliably predict task performance, given conflicting evidence about linear trends and challenges like emergence.

Method: Meta-analysis of existing data on downstream scaling laws, examining fit to linear trends and impact of experimental changes.

Result: Linear scaling trends occur only 39% of the time, and minor experimental changes can alter scaling behavior.

Conclusion: Scaling laws require deeper understanding of conditions for success, including cases deviating from linear trends.

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from
pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be
possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear
linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out
fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and
inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on
downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only
occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign
changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend.
Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which
scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss
and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling
behavior deviates from linear trends.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemeCMD is a Chinese multi-turn dialogue dataset with contextually retrieved memes, addressing the lack of multimodal expressiveness in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue datasets lack multimodal expressiveness and contextual nuance, limiting their effectiveness for modern social interactions.

Method: Combines a large-scale, MLLM-annotated meme library with auto-generated dialogues by dual agents, using a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold for contextual relevance.

Result: The approach generates contextually appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues effectively.

Conclusion: MemeCMD provides a scalable, privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid,
intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions.
Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually
annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual
nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we
introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue
dataset with contextually retrieved memes. Our dataset combines a large-scale,
MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across
diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to
ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually
appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

*Luise Häuser, Alexandros Stamatakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the challenge of applying computational phylogenetic methods to cognate data due to insufficient dataset sizes and demonstrates the limitations of automated dataset generation from multilingual resources like BabelNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of leveraging computational phylogenetic methods for cognate data, given the lack of large manually collected datasets.

Method: Automatically extracted cognate datasets from BabelNet and evaluated phylogenetic inferences against gold standard trees.

Result: Phylogenetic trees from BabelNet data were inconsistent with established gold standards, suggesting limitations in automated dataset generation.

Conclusion: Current computational approaches requiring large datasets are not viable for cognate data, leaving their application in historical linguistics uncertain.

Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for
cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine
learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are
substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently
available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to
automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by
automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual
encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the
respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with
the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we
consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character
matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis
approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate
data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational
approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.

*Guangliang Liu, Zimo Qi, Xitong Zhang, Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores moral self-correction in LLMs, identifying paradoxes in its effectiveness and proposing solutions based on heuristic analysis of discourse constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the paradoxes in moral self-correction in LLMs, where superficial effectiveness and inconsistency in diagnosing moral issues hinder alignment with human values.

Method: Analyzes discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora to uncover heuristics, demonstrating their role in moral self-correction and their limitations.

Result: Reveals that heuristic shortcuts in discourse constructions cause inconsistency in self-correction and self-diagnosis, proposing a solution using curated datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved moral self-correction techniques and addresses generalization challenges, particularly in context learning and model scalability.

Abstract: Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the
output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral
self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite
empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of
self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.
Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of
their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency
during their self-correction process. To better understand and address these
paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora
designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the
heuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral
self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic
shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during
self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both
self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,
we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the
heuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges
of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and
model scales.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether CLM-trained models outperform MLM-trained ones in text representation tasks, finding MLM generally better but CLM more data-efficient. A biphasic CLM-MLM training strategy is optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if CLM's advantages in text representation tasks are inherent or due to confounding factors like model/data scale.

Method: Large-scale pretraining ablations with 30 models (210M-1B parameters) and 15,000+ fine-tuning runs, comparing MLM and CLM.

Result: MLM performs better overall, but CLM is more data-efficient and stable. A biphasic CLM-MLM strategy yields optimal performance.

Conclusion: Combining CLM and MLM training is optimal, especially when leveraging existing CLM models, reducing computational costs for top-tier encoders.

Abstract: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.

linguistic and cultural diversity of the Spanish-speaking community, we present
La Leaderboard, the first open-source leaderboard to evaluate generative LLMs

initial version combines 66 datasets in Basque, Catalan, Galician, and
different Spanish varieties, showcasing the evaluation results of 50 models. To
encourage community-driven development of leaderboards in other languages, we
explain our methodology, including guidance on selecting the most suitable
evaluation setup for each downstream task. In particular, we provide a
rationale for using fewer few-shot examples than typically found in the
literature, aiming to reduce environmental impact and facilitate access to
reproducible results for a broader research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks for scientific literature tasks lack community engagement and open-ended evaluation. SciArena aims to address this by involving researchers directly in model comparisons.

Method: SciArena uses community voting (similar to Chatbot Arena) to evaluate models on literature-grounded, long-form tasks. It supports 23 models and analyzes diversity, real-world alignment, and annotator consistency.

Result: Over 13,000 votes show diverse, real-world-aligned questions and strong annotator agreement. The leaderboard provides model rankings, and SciArena-Eval highlights challenges in automated evaluation.

Conclusion: SciArena successfully engages the community for model evaluation and reveals gaps in automated methods, promoting further research in reliable evaluation systems.

Abstract: We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating
foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks
for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the
research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of
community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence,
SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on
open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form
responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary
foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers
across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and
confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world
literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong
self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss
the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further
promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for
literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based
on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models
in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human
votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the
need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.

*Yingji Zhang, Danilo S. Carvalho, André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to integrate formal semantic properties into distributional sentence representations for better control and interpretability in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the controllability and interpretability of sentence representations in language models by incorporating formal semantic properties.

Method: Theoretical framing of sentence semantics as composition of semantic role-word content features, using Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder with supervision and a probing algorithm.

Result: Formal semantic geometry improves control and interpretation of sentence generation in Transformer-based LMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully injects formal semantic properties into language models, enhancing their controllability and interpretability.

Abstract: Formal/symbolic semantics can provide canonical, rigid controllability and
interpretability to sentence representations due to their \textit{localisation}
or \textit{composition} property. How can we deliver such property to the
current distributional sentence representations to control and interpret the
generation of language models (LMs)? In this work, we theoretically frame the
sentence semantics as the composition of \textit{semantic role - word content}
features and propose the formal semantic geometry. To inject such geometry into
Transformer-based LMs (i.e. GPT2), we deploy Transformer-based Variational
AutoEncoder with a supervision approach, where the sentence generation can be
manipulated and explained over low-dimensional latent Gaussian space. In
addition, we propose a new probing algorithm to guide the movement of sentence
vectors over such geometry. Experimental results reveal that the formal
semantic geometry can potentially deliver better control and interpretation to
sentence generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Complex Attributed Question Answering (CAQA), a benchmark addressing limitations in AQA evaluation, featuring fine-grained attribution categories, automatic KG-based generation, and complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in evaluating attributions in AQA, such as lack of fine-grained categories, reliance on manual annotations, and inability to compare subtle differences.

Method: Developed CAQA using Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for automatic generation of comprehensive attribution categories and complex scenarios. Evaluated 25 automatic evaluators, compared them with human evaluators, and tested fine-tuned LLM evaluators.

Result: CAQA proved effective, with experiments revealing important findings for future AQA research.

Conclusion: CAQA serves as a valuable benchmark for AQA, with publicly available codes and data.

Abstract: Attributed Question Answering (AQA) has attracted wide attention, but there
are still several limitations in evaluating the attributions, including lacking
fine-grained attribution categories, relying on manual annotations, and failing
to compare attributions with only subtle differences. To bridge these gaps, we
introduce Complex Attributed Question Answering (CAQA), a large-scale benchmark
containing comprehensive attribution categories, automatically generated using
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and complex attribution scenarios. We have conducted
extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of CAQA, including the
benchmarking of 25 automatic evaluators, their comparison with human
evaluators, the testing of LLM evaluators fine-tuned by CAQA and so on. These
experiments also lead to a series of important findings that can benefit the
future research of AQA. All the codes and data are publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for estimating confidence in LLM responses using interpretable features and logistic regression, showing effectiveness across multiple models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate trust in model responses by estimating confidence, especially with only black-box access to LLMs.

Method: Engineer novel features and train a logistic regression model to predict confidence in responses.

Result: Outperforms baselines by over 10% in some cases, with models generalizing zero-shot across LLMs.

Conclusion: Simple, interpretable framework effectively estimates confidence and provides insights into predictive features.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be
significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the
model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating
confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box
or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we
engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic
regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically
demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of
Flan-ul2, Llama-13b, Mistral-7b and GPT-4 on four benchmark Q\&A tasks as well
as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it
surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases.
Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that
are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery
that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others
on a given dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the efficiency of deduplication techniques for large NLP datasets, particularly economic research paper titles, to ensure data quality.

Result: Low prevalence of duplicates observed across methods, with NLP and LLM-based metrics validated by human annotation.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of NLP-based deduplication, suggesting further refinement with human validation for conclusive results.

Abstract: This study investigates efficient deduplication techniques for a large NLP
dataset of economic research paper titles. We explore various pairing methods
alongside established distance measures (Levenshtein distance, cosine
similarity) and a sBERT model for semantic evaluation. Our findings suggest a
potentially low prevalence of duplicates based on the observed semantic
similarity across different methods. Further exploration with a human-annotated
ground truth set is completed for a more conclusive assessment. The result
supports findings from the NLP, LLM based distance metrics.

*Denitsa Saynova, Lovisa Hagström, Moa Johansson, Richard Johansson, Marco Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrISM, a method to analyze how language models (LMs) predict facts, distinguishing between recall, guesswork, and heuristics. It uses causal tracing and information flow analysis to reveal distinct processing patterns for each scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretations of LMs overlook the diverse signals they use for predictions, such as factual recall or name-based assumptions. This limits understanding of LM behavior.

Method: The authors propose PrISM to create datasets for four prediction scenarios (generic LM, guesswork, heuristics, exact recall) and apply causal tracing and information flow analysis.

Result: Exact fact recall and generic LM scenarios emphasize mid-range MLP sublayers, while guesswork and heuristics rely on late last token MLP sublayers.

Conclusion: The study provides tools and insights for a nuanced analysis of how LMs process fact-related queries, improving interpretability.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) can make a correct prediction based on many possible
signals in a prompt, not all corresponding to recall of factual associations.
However, current interpretations of LMs fail to take this into account. For
example, given the query "Astrid Lindgren was born in" with the corresponding
completion "Sweden", no difference is made between whether the prediction was
based on knowing where the author was born or assuming that a person with a
Swedish-sounding name was born in Sweden. In this paper, we present a
model-specific recipe - PrISM - for constructing datasets with examples of four
different prediction scenarios: generic language modeling, guesswork,
heuristics recall and exact fact recall. We apply two popular interpretability
methods to the scenarios: causal tracing (CT) and information flow analysis. We
find that both yield distinct results for each scenario. Results for exact fact
recall and generic language modeling scenarios confirm previous conclusions
about the importance of mid-range MLP sublayers for fact recall, while results
for guesswork and heuristics indicate a critical role of late last token
position MLP sublayers. In summary, we contribute resources for a more
extensive and granular study of fact completion in LMs, together with analyses
that provide a more nuanced understanding of how LMs process fact-related
queries.

TL;DR: ECG-Byte is a novel BPE tokenizer pipeline for direct end-to-end LLM training of ECG signals, improving efficiency and interpretability over traditional two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating text from ECG signals are inefficient due to multi-stage training and lack interpretability of encoder-generated features.

Method: Proposed ECG-Byte, a BPE tokenizer pipeline that compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens for direct LLM training, combining ECG and text tokens.

Result: Achieves competitive NLG performance, trains 3 times faster, and uses only 48% of the data compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ECG-Byte offers a more efficient and interpretable solution for ECG-to-text generation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across
domains, including applications to electrocardiograms (ECGs). A growing body of
work focuses on generating text from multi-channeled ECG signals and
corresponding textual prompts. Existing approaches often involve a two-stage
process: pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning
(SSL) objective, followed by finetuning an LLM for natural language generation
(NLG) using encoder-derived features. However, these methods face two key
limitations: inefficiency due to multi-stage training and challenges in
interpreting encoder-generated features. To overcome these issues, we propose
ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for
autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. ECG-Byte compresses and encodes ECG
signals into tokens, enabling direct end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG
and text tokens. This approach enhances interpretability, as ECG tokens can be
directly mapped back to the original signals. Leveraging ECG-Byte, we achieve
competitive NLG performance while training 3 times faster and using just 48\%
of the data required by traditional two-stage methods.

TL;DR: BlockDialect is a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique for quantizing LLMs, using DialectFP4 for better data representation and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing memory and computational challenges in large language models (LLMs) by improving quantization methods for weights and activations.

Method: Proposes BlockDialect for per-block optimal number format assignment and DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants. Introduces a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization.

Result: Achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) compared to MXFP4, with lower bit usage and near-full precision performance.

Conclusion: BlockDialect offers an energy-efficient solution for LLM inference by focusing on optimal data representation.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing size of large language models (LLMs) presents
significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both
weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported
fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers.
However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions.
We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that
assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data
representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4
variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To
leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online
DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy
efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with
low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy
gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit
usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when
quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over
how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies text-to-SQL errors in LLMs, identifies 29 error types, evaluates existing repair methods, and introduces MapleRepair, a framework that improves correctness with lower overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the widespread correctness issues in LLM-based text-to-SQL tasks and the inefficiency of existing repair solutions.

Method: Comprehensive study of four ICL-based techniques, five repair methods, two benchmarks, and two LLM settings, leading to the development of MapleRepair.

Result: Identified 29 error types; MapleRepair repairs 13.8% more queries with negligible mis-repairs and 67.4% less overhead.

Conclusion: MapleRepair is an effective solution for text-to-SQL error detection and repair, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to perform text-to-SQL tasks,
utilizing their in-context learning (ICL) capability to translate natural
language questions into structured query language (SQL). However, such a
technique faces correctness problems and requires efficient repairing
solutions. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of
text-to-SQL errors. Our study covers four representative ICL-based techniques,
five basic repairing methods, two benchmarks, and two LLM settings. We find
that text-to-SQL errors are widespread and summarize 29 error types of 7
categories. We also find that existing repairing attempts have limited
correctness improvement at the cost of high computational overhead with many
mis-repairs. Based on the findings, we propose MapleRepair, a novel text-to-SQL
error detection and repairing framework. The evaluation demonstrates that
MapleRepair outperforms existing solutions by repairing 13.8% more queries with
neglectable mis-repairs and 67.4% less overhead.

### [51] [RocketKV: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Two-Stage KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14051)
*Payman Behnam, Yaosheng Fu, Ritchie Zhao, Po-An Tsai, Zhiding Yu, Alexey Tumanov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RocketKV is a training-free KV cache compression method for Transformer-based models, achieving high compression ratios and speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache in large language models grows with input length, straining memory and bandwidth. RocketKV aims to mitigate this.

Method: RocketKV uses two stages: coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction and fine-grain top-k sparse attention with dimensionality reduction.

Result: Achieves up to 400x compression, 3.7x speedup, and 32.6% memory reduction with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: RocketKV effectively optimizes KV cache usage, outperforming existing methods in multi-turn scenarios.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on the KV cache to
efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of
the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory
bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we
present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two
consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV
cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a
hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention,
approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence
dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio
of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak
memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU
compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy
loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV
for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods
and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.

*Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE introduces latent variables (State-Action Chain) to control emotional states and strategies in chatbots, improving emotional intelligence while maintaining LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building emotionally intelligent chatbots capable of natural, strategic conversations remains a challenge despite advances in large language models.

Method: Uses latent variables (SAC) to augment fine-tuning, enabling control over dialogue progression. Includes a self-improvement pipeline with tree search, reward modeling, and fine-tuning.

Result: Improved emotional intelligence metrics while maintaining strong LLM benchmark performance.

Conclusion: SAGE's discrete latent variables enable search-based strategies and future RL applications for dialogue systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in task-oriented applications, yet building emotionally
intelligent chatbots that can engage in natural, strategic conversations
remains a challenge. We present a novel approach called SAGE that uses latent
variables to control long-horizon behavior in dialogue generation. At the core
of our method is the State-Action Chain (SAC), which augments standard language
model fine-tuning by introducing latent variables that encapsulate emotional
states and conversational strategies between dialogue turns. During inference,
these variables are generated before each response, enabling coarse-grained
control over dialogue progression while maintaining natural interaction
patterns. We also introduce a self-improvement pipeline that leverages dialogue
tree search, LLM-based reward modeling, and targeted fine-tuning to optimize
conversational trajectories. Our experimental results show that models trained
with this approach demonstrate improved performance in emotional intelligence
metrics while maintaining strong capabilities on LLM benchmarks. The discrete
nature of our latent variables facilitates search-based strategies and provides
a foundation for future applications of reinforcement learning to dialogue
systems, where learning can occur at the state level rather than the token
level. https://github.com/apple/ml-sage-dialog-gen

TL;DR: SPADE is a framework for detecting synthetic dialogues using prompt-based samples, improving MGT detection with new datasets and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of high-quality synthetic datasets for training MGT detection models due to misuse concerns of LLMs.

Method: Proposes SPADE, a structured framework using prompt-based positive and negative samples, creating 14 new dialogue datasets and benchmarking against eight MGT detection models.

Result: Improved generalization performance with mixed datasets and practical enhancement of LLM security. Examines chat history length's impact on detection accuracy.

Conclusion: SPADE offers a robust solution for synthetic dialogue detection, with open-source resources for further research.

Abstract: The increasing capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate
synthetic content has heightened concerns about their misuse, driving the
development of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection models. However, these
detectors face significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality synthetic
datasets for training. To address this issue, we propose SPADE, a structured
framework for detecting synthetic dialogues using prompt-based positive and
negative samples. Our proposed methods yield 14 new dialogue datasets, which we
benchmark against eight MGT detection models. The results demonstrate improved
generalization performance when utilizing a mixed dataset produced by proposed
augmentation frameworks, offering a practical approach to enhancing LLM
application security. Considering that real-world agents lack knowledge of
future opponent utterances, we simulate online dialogue detection and examine
the relationship between chat history length and detection accuracy. Our
open-source datasets, code and prompts can be downloaded from

*Yujie Liu, Zonglin Yang, Tong Xie, Jinjie Ni, Ben Gao, Yuqiang Li, Shixiang Tang, Wanli Ouyang, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability in scientific hypothesis discovery, covering inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and ranking. It uses a 2024-only dataset to avoid contamination, showing LLMs excel in inspiration retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' potential in generating high-quality research hypotheses, a capability not yet benchmarked, by creating a dedicated evaluation framework.

Method: Developed an automated framework extracting key components (e.g., research questions, hypotheses) from 2024 scientific papers across 12 disciplines, validated by experts.

Result: LLMs perform well in inspiration retrieval, an out-of-distribution task, indicating their ability to uncover novel knowledge associations.

Conclusion: LLMs can act as 'research hypothesis mines,' enabling scalable, automated scientific discovery with minimal human input.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting
scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research
hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To
address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating
LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery:
inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We
develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research
questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific
papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy.
To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in
2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation
reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an
out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge
associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of
facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses
at scale with minimal human intervention.

*Rohitash Chandra, Aryan Chaudhari, Yeshwanth Rayavarapu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs (Gemini, GPT, Google Translate) for translating Indian languages (Sanskrit, Telugu, Hindi) into English, comparing them to expert translations. GPT outperforms in sentiment and semantic preservation, though challenges remain in complex contexts like the Bhagavad Gita.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality of LLM translations for Indian languages, focusing on semantic and sentiment accuracy compared to expert translations.

Method: Semantic and sentiment analysis of LLM-generated translations (Bhagavad Gita, Tamas, Maha Prasthanam) compared to expert translations.

Result: GPT models excel in sentiment and semantic preservation, outperforming Google Translate, but struggle with metaphorical/philosophical contexts.

Conclusion: GPT shows promise for culturally sensitive translations, but further refinement is needed for complex texts.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have been prominent for language translation,
including low-resource languages. There has been limited study on the
assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini,
GPT, and Google Translate. This study addresses this limitation by using
semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages,
including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts (Bhagavad Gita,
Tamas and Maha Prasthanam ) that have been well translated by experts and use
LLMs to generate their translations into English, and provide a comparison with
selected expert (human) translations. Our investigation revealed that while
LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain
in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in metaphorical and
philosophical contexts for texts such as the Bhagavad Gita. The sentiment
analysis revealed that GPT models are better at preserving the sentiment
polarity for the given texts when compared to human (expert) translation. The
results revealed that GPT models are generally better at maintaining the
sentiment and semantics when compared to Google Translate. This study could
help in the development of accurate and culturally sensitive translation
systems for large language models.

*Anastasia Zhukova, Christian E. Matt, Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL-APT is an efficient domain-adaptive pretraining method using in-context learning and kNN, outperforming DAPT by 28.7% with 4x less GPU time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of limited labeled task data and domain-related corpora in non-English languages, like German, for NLP applications.

Method: Uses in-context learning (ICL) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to augment target data, reducing GPU time while maintaining performance.

Result: ICL-APT outperforms DAPT by 28.7% (7.87 points) and requires 4x less GPU time.

Conclusion: Provides a cost-effective solution for low-resource industries, enhancing accessibility of NLP solutions in production environments.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive continual pretraining (DAPT) is a state-of-the-art technique
that further trains a language model (LM) on its pretraining task, e.g., masked
language modeling (MLM), when common domain adaptation via LM fine-tuning is
not possible due to a lack of labeled task data. Although popular, MLM requires
a significant corpus of domain-related data, which is difficult to obtain for
specific domains in languages other than English, such as the process industry
in the German language. This paper introduces an efficient approach called
ICL-augmented pretraining or ICL-APT that leverages in-context learning (ICL)
and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to augment target data with domain-related and
in-domain texts, significantly reducing GPU time while maintaining strong model
performance. Our results show that the best configuration of ICL-APT performed
better than the state-of-the-art DAPT by 28.7% (7.87 points) and requires
almost 4 times less GPU-computing time, providing a cost-effective solution for
industries with limited computational capacity. The findings highlight the
broader applicability of this framework to other low-resource industries,
making NLP-based solutions more accessible and feasible in production
environments.

Motivation: To provide open-source, high-performance reasoning models with enterprise-friendly licensing and advanced features like dynamic reasoning toggling.

Method: Training involves neural architecture search, knowledge distillation, continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and large-scale reinforcement learning.

Result: Models (Nano, Super, Ultra) compete with state-of-the-art reasoning models while excelling in inference throughput and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: Llama-Nemotron models advance open-source reasoning capabilities with practical features and released resources for broader adoption and research.

Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of
heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities,
inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes
in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs
competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while
offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report,
we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural
architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge
distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused
post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and
large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first
open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to
switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further
support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the
following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models --
LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA
Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset:
Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training
codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring toxicity-free LLMs in diverse linguistic contexts is a critical challenge, especially for high and low-resource languages.

Method: A cross-lingual paradigm is explored to transfer detoxification capabilities between languages, tested in 392 settings with limited data.

Result: The study evaluates toxicity reduction and its impact on model performance, revealing trade-offs between safety and knowledge preservation.

Conclusion: The approach is effective but highlights the need to balance detoxification with maintaining model performance on non-toxic tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in global
applications, ensuring that they are toxicity-free across diverse linguistic
contexts remains a critical challenge. We explore "Cross-lingual
Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling
detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages
across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's
effectiveness through 392 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in
cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation
impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between
safety and knowledge preservation. Our code and dataset are publicly available

### [59] [Not Minds, but Signs: Reframing LLMs through Semiotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17080)
*Davide Picca*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues for a semiotic view of LLMs, rejecting the cognitive framing, and highlights their role in sign manipulation and meaning-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the anthropomorphic view of LLMs as cognitive systems and propose a semiotic framework for understanding their function in cultural processes.

Method: Theoretical analysis and practical examples demonstrate LLMs as semiotic agents generating texts open to interpretation.

Result: LLMs are reframed as tools for creativity, dialogue, and critical inquiry, altering how meaning is produced and interpreted.

Conclusion: A semiotic approach provides a rigorous, ethically aware framework for studying LLMs, emphasizing their role in the ecology of signs.

Abstract: This paper challenges the prevailing tendency to frame Large Language Models
(LLMs) as cognitive systems, arguing instead for a semiotic perspective that
situates these models within the broader dynamics of sign manipulation and
meaning-making. Rather than assuming that LLMs understand language or simulate
human thought, we propose that their primary function is to recombine,
recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic
associations. By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid
anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate
in cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite
interpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper
demonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated
as interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection.
We explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural
production, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue,
and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated,
contingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous
and ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this
approach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of
signs. They do not possess minds, but they alter how we read, write, and make
meaning, compelling us to reconsider the foundations of language,
interpretation, and the role of artificial systems in the production of
knowledge.

*Chen Shani, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares how humans and LLMs organize knowledge, finding that while LLMs align broadly with human categories, they lack fine-grained distinctions and favor aggressive compression over nuanced human-like representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs achieve human-like semantic compression and fidelity in knowledge organization.

Method: An information-theoretic framework based on Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, analyzing LLM token embeddings against human categorization benchmarks.

Result: LLMs form broad categories aligned with humans but miss fine-grained distinctions and prioritize aggressive compression over nuanced human-like representations.

Conclusion: The study highlights key differences between AI and human cognition, suggesting pathways for developing LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.

Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic
compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while
preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can
fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and
representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations
strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is
unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from
Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to
quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a
diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we
uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align
with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic
distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs
demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas
human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual
richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our
measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and
human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more
human-aligned conceptual representations.

### [61] [Revisiting Epistemic Markers in Confidence Estimation: Can Markers Accurately Reflect Large Language Models' Uncertainty?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24778)
*Jiayu Liu, Qing Zong, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs use epistemic markers (e.g., "fairly confident") to reflect their intrinsic confidence, finding inconsistencies in out-of-distribution settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately assessing LLM confidence is crucial for high-stakes applications, but it's unclear if epistemic markers reliably reflect intrinsic confidence.

Method: Defines marker confidence as observed accuracy when a model uses an epistemic marker and evaluates it across question-answering datasets in in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Result: Markers generalize well within the same distribution but show inconsistent confidence in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Epistemic markers are unreliable for confidence estimation, highlighting the need for better alignment between markers and actual model uncertainty.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains,
accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express
confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., "fairly confident") instead of
numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use
these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of
quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap,
we first define marker confidence as the observed accuracy when a model employs
an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple
question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while
markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is
inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant
concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation,
underscoring the need for improved alignment between marker based confidence
and actual model uncertainty. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark to evaluate AI models' pedagogical knowledge, addressing a gap in existing benchmarks focused on content knowledge. It reports results for 97 models and provides an online leaderboard for interactive exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on content knowledge, neglecting pedagogical understanding, which is critical for AI's role in education.

Method: The benchmark uses questions from professional teacher exams, covering pedagogical subdomains like teaching strategies and assessment methods. Results for 97 models are analyzed, with accuracy ranging from 28% to 89%.

Result: Model accuracies vary widely (28%-89%), and the paper explores cost-accuracy trade-offs. An online leaderboard allows interactive exploration of model performance.

Conclusion: Pedagogical benchmarks are essential for responsible AI deployment in education, guiding development and policy decisions.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

TL;DR: StorySim is a framework for generating synthetic stories to evaluate LLMs' theory of mind and world modeling, revealing performance gaps and heuristic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address contamination in pretraining data and enable precise evaluation of ToM and WM in LLMs.

Method: Uses a controllable Storyboard to generate novel, compositional story prompts for ToM and WM tasks.

Result: LLMs perform better on WM than ToM tasks and show heuristic behaviors like recency bias.

Conclusion: StorySim provides a robust tool for evaluating LLMs, uncovering limitations and biases in reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on STS and TR tasks.

Conclusion: DALR effectively enhances multimodal sentence representation quality.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Conclusion: ComRAG effectively addresses challenges in industrial CQA, outperforming existing methods in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

*Siyuan Li, Ruitong Liu, Yan Wen, Te Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) for Knowledge Graph Completion, combining static and dynamic modeling to improve relational semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods rely on static embeddings, lacking contextual and dynamic relational understanding.

Method: FMS uses semantic context learning and conditional flow-matching to dynamically refine static scores.

Result: FMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: FMS enhances KGC by integrating context-aware static and dynamic relational modeling.

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

*Dingzriui Wang, Xuanliang Zhang, Keyan Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che, Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS) metric to evaluate in-context learning (ICL) effectiveness in LLMs, addressing reliability, attribution, and data scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL evaluation methods are unreliable, poorly attributed, and impractical in data-insufficient scenarios, necessitating a better metric.

Method: Proposes LCS, which models the slope between learning gain (loss decrease) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input relevance) to quantify ICL effectiveness.

Result: LCS reliably correlates with performance improvements, works in biased/data-scarce scenarios, and identifies actionable thresholds and critical model capabilities.

Conclusion: LCS is a robust metric for evaluating ICL effectiveness, offering practical insights for practitioners.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

*Zixian Huang, Chenxu Niu, Yu Gu, Gengyang Xiao, Xinwei Huang, Gong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new pipelined decoder architecture enables parallel text generation, improving speed without compromising quality or memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models generate tokens sequentially, creating a speed bottleneck. This paper aims to enable parallel generation while maintaining quality.

Method: Proposes a pipelined decoder that generates multiple subsequences simultaneously, producing new tokens for each subsequence in parallel.

Result: Experiments show significant speed improvements in tasks like question answering and summarization, with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: The pipelined decoder effectively addresses the speed bottleneck of autoregressive models without sacrificing quality or memory efficiency.

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

*Tiziano Labruna, Simone Gallo, Giovanni Da San Martino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study quantifies positional bias in binary question answering across five large language models, showing it grows exponentially with increased uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how positional bias in models varies with answer uncertainty, using adapted datasets and benchmarks.

Method: Adapted SQuAD-it dataset with incorrect options, created versions with varying uncertainty, and evaluated benchmarks (WebGPT, Winning Arguments). Flipped correct option order to measure bias.

Result: Positional bias is minimal in low-uncertainty conditions but increases exponentially with higher uncertainty.

Conclusion: Positional bias in models is strongly influenced by answer uncertainty, highlighting the need for bias mitigation in uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for unifying domain-specific MLLMs via parameter integration, using CAPS for efficient fusion and domain compatibility scoring for alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fragmentation of knowledge in domain-specific MLLMs and enabling modular composition of expert capabilities.

Method: Proposes Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) for selective parameter fusion, extended to low-rank adaptation layers, and introduces domain compatibility scoring.

Result: Effective integration of heterogeneous expertise validated across diverse multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable solution for compositional, domain-adaptive MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates transformer-based models (E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, LaBSE) for detecting parallel passages in biblical Hebrew, finding E5 and AlephBERT effective for parallel and non-parallel differentiation, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual comparison of biblical Hebrew texts is labor-intensive and error-prone, prompting the need for automated methods.

Method: Pre-trained transformer models (E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, LaBSE) were tested using cosine similarity and Wasserstein Distance to detect parallels in Samuel/Kings and Chronicles.

Result: E5 excels in detecting parallels, while AlephBERT better differentiates non-parallel passages.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models can improve efficiency and accuracy in detecting intertextual parallels, with potential applications in ancient language studies.

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew (BH) is central to biblical
scholarship for understanding intertextual relationships. Traditional methods
rely on manual comparison, a labor-intensive process prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between Samuel/Kings and
Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
distinguishing parallel from non-parallel passages. Using cosine similarity and
Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show promise; E5
excels in parallel detection, while AlephBERT demonstrates stronger
non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate that pre-trained models
can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting intertextual parallels in
ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for ancient language studies.

*Mustafa Chasmai, Gauri Jagatap, Gouthaman KV, Grant Van Horn, Subhransu Maji, Andrea Fanelli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes 'moment sampling' for Video LLMs to improve long-form VideoQA by selecting relevant frames using a text-to-video moment retrieval model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frame sub-sampling methods for Video LLMs lose key frames or include redundant ones, impairing long-range reasoning in VideoQA.

Method: Uses a lightweight moment retrieval model to guide frame selection, focusing on question-relevant frames.

Result: Enhances long-form VideoQA performance across four datasets and four Video LLMs.

Conclusion: Moment sampling is effective for improving Video LLMs' accuracy and efficiency in long-form VideoQA.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ER-EMU, an edge model update algorithm, uses adaptive experience replay and a domain distance metric to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in dynamic traffic monitoring, improving object detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in cloud-edge collaborative object detection for traffic monitoring hinders model adaptation to dynamic environments with periodic variations (e.g., day/night). Existing methods fail to efficiently prioritize historical data.

Method: ER-EMU combines a FIFO-managed experience buffer with a Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm using MK-MMD to select dissimilar historical data, ensuring diverse training and knowledge retention.

Result: Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset show ER-EMU consistently enhances performance in cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks.

Conclusion: ER-EMU effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting by intelligently leveraging historical data, improving adaptability and performance in dynamic traffic environments.

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-CLIP is a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MRI images with DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, addressing challenges of incomplete or noisy metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of reliable and standardized metadata in MRI scans complicates tasks like image interpretation and retrieval, necessitating robust contrast-aware representations for advanced clinical applications.

Method: MR-CLIP uses contrastive learning to align MR images with their DICOM metadata, trained on diverse clinical datasets without manual labels.

Result: MR-CLIP effectively captures contrast variations, enabling anatomy-invariant representations and excelling in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification.

Conclusion: MR-CLIP offers a scalable solution for contrast-aware representations, with potential for broader clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes and compares three artifact detection methods for Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) in cancer diagnostics, with the foundation model-based approach (FMA) outperforming others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in WSIs compromise image analysis, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: Three approaches: FMA (fine-tuned UNI architecture), DLA (ResNet50 backbone), and KBA (handcrafted features). Evaluated on 50,000+ patches.

Result: FMA achieved the highest AUROC (0.995), outperforming DLA (0.977) and KBA (0.940).

Conclusion: FMA is superior for artifact detection in WSIs, with a quality report scorecard aiding actionable insights.

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to
digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however,
other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

*Yuxin Mao, Jing Zhang, Mochu Xiang, Yunqiu Lv, Dong Li, Yiran Zhong, Yuchao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A contrastive conditional latent diffusion model for audio-visual segmentation (AVS) enhances audio impact by modeling correlation and optimizing density ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To thoroughly investigate the impact of audio in AVS and ensure strong correlation between audio and segmentation maps.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion model for conditional generation, optimizing density ratios to maximize audio contribution, with contrastive learning as a constraint.

Result: Effectively enhances audio contribution for AVS, validated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully integrates audio impact in AVS through contrastive learning and density ratio optimization.

Abstract: We propose a contrastive conditional latent diffusion model for audio-visual
segmentation (AVS) to thoroughly investigate the impact of audio, where the
correlation between audio and the final segmentation map is modeled to
guarantee the strong correlation between them. To achieve semantic-correlated
representation learning, our framework incorporates a latent diffusion model.
The diffusion model learns the conditional generation process of the
ground-truth segmentation map, resulting in ground-truth aware inference during
the denoising process at the test stage. As our model is conditional, it is
vital to ensure that the conditional variable contributes to the model output.
We thus extensively model the contribution of the audio signal by minimizing
the density ratio between the conditional probability of the multimodal data,
e.g. conditioned on the audio-visual data, and that of the unimodal data, e.g.
conditioned on the audio data only. In this way, our latent diffusion model via
density ratio optimization explicitly maximizes the contribution of audio for
AVS, which can then be achieved with contrastive learning as a constraint,
where the diffusion part serves as the main objective to achieve maximum
likelihood estimation, and the density ratio optimization part imposes the

### [80] [CaughtCheating: Is Your MLLM a Good Cheating Detective? Exploring the Boundary of Visual Perception and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00045)
*Ming Li, Chenguang Wang, Yijun Liang, Xiyao Wang, Yuhang Zhou, Xiyang Wu, Yuqing Zhang, Ruiyi Zhang, Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaughtCheating, a challenging scenario where advanced MLLMs like GPT-o3 fail, highlighting gaps in visual perception and reasoning compared to human detectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs perform well on benchmarks but struggle in expert-level tasks like detecting subtle clues in images, prompting the need for harder tests.

Method: The study investigates scenarios where GPT-o3 fails, particularly CaughtCheating, inspired by social media requests to detect suspicious clues in photos.

Result: GPT-o3's performance drops to nearly zero in CaughtCheating, revealing limitations in visual perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: CaughtCheating offers valuable, practical challenges for MLLMs, aiming to bridge the gap to human-level detective capabilities.

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

*Bahri Batuhan Bilecen, Ahmet Berke Gokmen, Furkan Guzelant, Aysegul Dundar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for 3D head stylization using PanoHead and negative log-likelihood distillation to improve identity preservation and stylization quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D stylization methods often fail to preserve unique identities and lack diversity, especially in non-frontal views.

Method: Leverages PanoHead for 360-degree synthesis, integrates multi-view grid score and mirror gradients, and uses score rank weighing in a 3D GAN architecture.

Result: Achieves qualitative and quantitative improvements in stylization and identity preservation.

Conclusion: Advances 3D head stylization and provides insights into distillation between diffusion models and GANs.

Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic
representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality
applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements,
many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle
to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in
outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these
challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a
comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs
negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and
improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror
gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing
technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative
improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization
but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes
between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity
preservation. Please visit the https://three-bee.github.io/head_stylization for

*Akshansh Mishra, Eyob Mesele Sefene, Shivraman Thapliyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An evolutionary computing-based image segmentation method using PSO for defect detection in AFSD processes, integrating gradient and distance transforms for enhanced visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve defect detection and feature analysis in multilayer AFSD builds by leveraging advanced image segmentation and visualization techniques.

Method: Uses PSO for optimal thresholding, gradient magnitude analysis, and distance transforms to create attention-weighted visualizations (self-attention maps, multi-channel visualization).

Result: PSO identified thresholds (156-173) for precise segmentation; multi-channel visualization revealed hidden defects and material transitions.

Conclusion: Attention-based analysis effectively detects bonding issues and inhomogeneities, offering quantitative metrics for AFSD quality assessment and optimization.

Abstract: This work proposes an evolutionary computing-based image segmentation
approach for analyzing soundness in Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD)
processes. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was employed to determine optimal
segmentation thresholds for detecting defects and features in multilayer AFSD
builds. The methodology integrates gradient magnitude analysis with distance
transforms to create novel attention-weighted visualizations that highlight
critical interface regions. Five AFSD samples processed under different
conditions were analyzed using multiple visualization techniques i.e.
self-attention maps, and multi-channel visualization. These complementary
approaches reveal subtle material transition zones and potential defect regions
which were not readily observable through conventional imaging. The PSO
algorithm automatically identified optimal threshold values (ranging from
156-173) for each sample, enabling precise segmentation of material interfaces.
The multi-channel visualization technique effectively combines boundary
information (red channel), spatial relationships (green channel), and material
density data (blue channel) into cohesive representations that quantify
interface quality. The results demonstrate that attention-based analysis
successfully identifies regions of incomplete bonding and inhomogeneities in
AFSD joints, providing quantitative metrics for process optimization and
quality assessment of additively manufactured components.

*Jiaqi Deng, Kaize Shi, Zonghan Wu, Huan Huo, Dingxian Wang, Guandong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified retrieval-augmented VQA framework improves KB-VQA performance by enabling collaborative knowledge sharing between retrieval and generation tasks, achieving a 4.7% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KB-VQA methods treat knowledge retrieval and answer generation as separate modules, limiting bi-directional knowledge sharing and performance.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with collaborative parametric knowledge calibration, late interaction for fine-grained understanding, and a reflective-answering mechanism.

Result: Achieves a 4.7% improvement in answering accuracy and a 7.5% boost in base MLLMs' VQA performance.

Conclusion: The framework enhances KB-VQA by integrating retrieval and generation tasks, improving accuracy and knowledge utilization.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) systems address complex
visual-grounded questions with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge
bases. The tasks of knowledge retrieval and answer generation tasks both
necessitate precise multimodal understanding of question context and external
knowledge. However, existing methods treat these two stages as separate modules
with limited interaction during training, which hinders bi-directional
parametric knowledge sharing, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance. To
fully exploit the cross-task synergy in KB-VQA, we propose a unified
retrieval-augmented VQA framework with collaborative parametric knowledge
calibration. The proposed framework can effectively adapt general multimodal
pre-trained models for fine-grained, knowledge-intensive tasks while enabling
the retriever and generator to collaboratively enhance and share their
parametric knowledge during both training and inference. To enhance
fine-grained understanding of questions and external documents, we also
integrate late interaction mechanism into the proposed training framework.
Additionally, we introduce a reflective-answering mechanism that allows the
model to explicitly evaluate and refine its knowledge boundary. Our approach
achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art models, delivering a
significant 4.7\% improvement in answering accuracy, and brings an average
7.5\% boost in base MLLMs' VQA performance.

### [84] [AdaDeDup: Adaptive Hybrid Data Pruning for Efficient Large-Scale Object Detection Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00049)
*Feiyang Kang, Nadine Chang, Maying Shen, Marc T. Law, Rafid Mahmood, Ruoxi Jia, Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaDeDup is a hybrid data pruning method combining density-based and model-informed feedback to efficiently prune redundant data while preserving critical samples, improving data efficiency in large-scale model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale datasets are computationally burdensome and redundant, but existing pruning methods are either task-agnostic or computationally expensive.

Method: AdaDeDup integrates density-based pruning with model feedback, adaptively adjusting pruning thresholds per cluster based on task-aware signals.

Result: AdaDeDup outperforms baselines, reduces performance degradation (e.g., 54% vs. random sampling), and achieves near-original performance with 20% data pruned.

Conclusion: AdaDeDup effectively enhances data efficiency for large-scale training, demonstrated on benchmarks like Waymo, COCO, and nuScenes.

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

*Binesh Sadanandan, Vahid Behzadan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF-Med is a framework for evaluating vulnerabilities in medical Vision Language Models (VLMs) using adversarial attacks and a scoring rubric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic security evaluations for VLMs in medical imaging.

Method: VSF-Med combines text-prompt attack templates, imperceptible visual perturbations, and an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by LLMs.

Result: The framework tested 30,000 adversarial variants, revealing vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art VLMs like Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: VSF-Med provides a reproducible benchmark for assessing medical VLM security, highlighting significant vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

TL;DR: MANTA unifies visual and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing with large language models, improving multi-modal learning by addressing alignment, synchronization, representation, and retrieval challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal learning approaches treat modalities separately, leading to inconsistencies in representation and reasoning.

Method: MANTA uses information-theoretic optimization for semantic alignment, adaptive temporal synchronization, hierarchical content representation, and context-aware retrieval, formalized in a mathematical framework.

Result: MANTA improves state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in accuracy for Long Video QA, with notable gains in temporal reasoning (23.8%) and cross-modal understanding (25.1%).

Conclusion: MANTA establishes new foundations for unifying multi-modal representations through structured text, with proven optimality and superior performance.

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system using YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 for early detection of plant diseases, with YOLOv8 showing superior performance in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of plant diseases is crucial to prevent widespread damage and improve crop yield, but manual monitoring is inefficient.

Method: The study employs transfer learning with YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models, fine-tuned on plant leaf images to detect diseases like Powdery Mildew and Tomato mosaic virus.

Result: YOLOv8 outperformed other methods with metrics like mAP (91.05), F1-score (89.40), Precision (91.22), and Recall (87.66).

Conclusion: The system offers a scalable, automated solution for early disease detection, enhancing crop yield and supporting sustainable agriculture.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

*Peter Mortimer, Mirko Maehlisch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes diffusion-based image augmentation to improve learning-based perception in underrepresented environments like snow, using foundation models and semantic filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor robots face performance issues in dynamic environments (e.g., snow) due to underrepresented training data.

Method: Uses diffusion-based image augmentation with vision foundation models and semantic segmentation to filter hallucinations.

Result: Enables better representation of deployment environments (e.g., snow) in training data.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based augmentation can generalize to other underrepresented environments like sand or volcanic terrains.

Abstract: The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed
in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are
particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to
dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes
underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system.
In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for
deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for
diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment
environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on
the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale
datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over
the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to
fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary
semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain
hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be
extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy
environments and volcanic terrains.

*Yu Lu, Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeLong and FreeLong++ are training-free frameworks to improve long video generation by balancing frequency distribution, enhancing temporal consistency and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models degrade in quality for longer videos due to high-frequency distortion.

Method: Proposes FreeLong (dual-branch) and FreeLong++ (multi-branch) to blend global low-frequency and local high-frequency features during denoising.

Result: Outperforms previous methods, enabling longer videos (4x-8x native length) with better consistency and fidelity.

Conclusion: FreeLong++ enhances existing models without training, supporting coherent multi-prompt and controllable video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short
video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer
videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal
consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively
applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable
quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where
high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,
an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose
FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency
distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong
achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic
semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted
from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,
FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture
with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.
By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables
multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both
semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video
sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into
existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer
videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video
generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent
multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables
controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.

TL;DR: SelvaBox is the largest open-access dataset for tropical tree crown detection, with 83,000 labeled crowns, improving detection accuracy and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical tree crown detection is vital for ecosystem studies but lacks annotated datasets, hindering robust model development.

Method: Introduces SelvaBox, a large dataset, and benchmarks models using high-resolution drone imagery and multi-resolution training.

Result: Higher-resolution inputs boost accuracy, and SelvaBox-trained models achieve competitive zero-shot performance. Joint training yields top-ranking detectors.

Conclusion: SelvaBox advances tropical tree crown detection, offering public resources for further research.

Abstract: Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study
these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and
climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and
pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote
sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in
tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering
robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access
dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It
spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns -
an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets
combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1)
higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models
trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection
performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding
competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other
datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified
multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all
evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.

TL;DR: A novel GNN-based Deep Learning architecture for identifying plant components in LiDAR 3D Point Cloud data, outperforming existing methods with over 80% IoU accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods using 2D imaging, 3D reconstructions, and CNNs have limitations in processing 3D data and identifying plant components, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: Proposes a GNN-based architecture using PCA for feature enhancement, KNN for edge establishment, Edge-Conv layers for feature augmentation, and GAT for classifying plant components.

Result: Achieves segmentation accuracy above 80% in IoU average, surpassing other point cloud-based models.

Conclusion: The graph-based deep learning approach effectively enhances the identification of individual plant components in 3D point cloud data.

Abstract: In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop
production is identifying individual plant components. There are several
attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D
reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have
several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant
components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning
architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on
the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex
and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,
thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used
to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the
plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our
graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for
identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the
IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiboSB, a challenging 6D pose video dataset for collaborative K-12 education, evaluates existing methods, and improves performance by fine-tuning YOLO11-x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle to capture real-world interactions in collaborative educational settings, which 6D pose estimation could address.

Method: The authors created FiboSB, a dataset of groups solving tasks with small cubes and a scale, tested four 6D pose methods, and fine-tuned YOLO11-x for better performance.

Result: Current 6D pose methods failed due to object detection issues; fine-tuned YOLO11-x achieved an mAP_50 of 0.898.

Conclusion: FiboSB and the improved method lay the foundation for better 6D pose estimation in collaborative contexts.

Abstract: Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational
frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters
deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing
systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions
between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with
automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and
orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups
that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to
relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel
and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants
solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.
This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically
recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled
with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently
non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on
FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group
work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'
object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for
FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results,
and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for
leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.

TL;DR: VOCAL is a novel visual odometry framework using contrastive learning and Bayesian inference to improve interpretability and flexibility in camera state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based VO methods rely on rigid geometric assumptions, lacking interpretability and theoretical grounding in data-driven frameworks.

Method: VOCAL reimagines VO as a label ranking challenge, integrating Bayesian inference and representation learning to align visual features with camera states.

Result: Evaluations on the KITTI dataset show VOCAL enhances interpretability and flexibility in spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: VOCAL advances VO by providing more general and explainable solutions, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in visual odometry (VO) have fundamentally reshaped the
landscape of robotics, enabling ultra-precise camera state estimation that is
crucial for modern autonomous systems. Despite these advances, many
learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, which often
fall short in interpretability and lack a solid theoretical basis within fully
data-driven frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VOCAL
(Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning), a novel framework that reimagines
VO as a label ranking challenge. By integrating Bayesian inference with a
representation learning framework, VOCAL organizes visual features to mirror
camera states. The ranking mechanism compels similar camera states to converge
into consistent and spatially coherent representations within the latent space.
This strategic alignment not only bolsters the interpretability of the learned
features but also ensures compatibility with multimodal data sources. Extensive
evaluations on the KITTI dataset highlight VOCAL's enhanced interpretability
and flexibility, pushing VO toward more general and explainable spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time sign language recognition using

*Zhuangzhuang Dai, Vincent Gbouna Zakka, Luis J. Manso, Chen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeTarget360 is a novel system for 360-degree gaze target estimation in images, addressing limitations of prior methods by integrating conditional inference engines for accurate predictions in unseen scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human gaze targets is critical for tasks like attention estimation and movement anticipation in human-robot interactions, but existing methods fail in out-of-frame or non-camera-facing scenarios.

Method: The system combines an eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion decoder to estimate gaze targets in generalized visual scenes.

Result: Cross-validation shows GazeTarget360 provides accurate and reliable gaze target predictions, outperforming prior methods in efficiency and deployability.

Conclusion: GazeTarget360 is a pioneering, efficient system for gaze target prediction from realistic camera footage, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Enabling robots to understand human gaze target is a crucial step to allow
capabilities in downstream tasks, for example, attention estimation and
movement anticipation in real-world human-robot interactions. Prior works have
addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches
by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation
methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in
images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away
from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of
360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.
The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an
eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion
decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate
and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a
first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage
which is highly efficient and deployable. Our source code is made publicly
available at: https://github.com/zdai257/DisengageNet.

*Zhiyin Lin, Purvi Goel, Joy Yun, C. Karen Liu, Joao Pedro Araujo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirtualFencer is a system that extracts 3D fencing motion and strategy from video without supervision, generating realistic fencing behavior for self-play, real fencer interaction, and professional fencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fencing involves diverse motions and strategic responses to opponents, making it ideal for data-driven modeling.

Method: VirtualFencer extracts 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild video unsupervisedly.

Result: The system can fence against itself, real fencers from video, and interactively against professionals.

Conclusion: VirtualFencer demonstrates versatile capabilities in modeling and generating realistic fencing behavior.

Abstract: Fencing is a sport where athletes engage in diverse yet strategically logical
motions. While most motions fall into a few high-level actions (e.g. step,
lunge, parry), the execution can vary widely-fast vs. slow, large vs. small,
offensive vs. defensive. Moreover, a fencer's actions are informed by a
strategy that often comes in response to the opponent's behavior. This
combination of motion diversity with underlying two-player strategy motivates
the application of data-driven modeling to fencing. We present VirtualFencer, a
system capable of extracting 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild
video without supervision, and then using that extracted knowledge to generate
realistic fencing behavior. We demonstrate the versatile capabilities of our
system by having it (i) fence against itself (self-play), (ii) fence against a
real fencer's motion from online video, and (iii) fence interactively against a
professional fencer.

*Vignesh Ram Nithin Kappagantula, Shayan Hassantabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning pipeline to categorize and group vacation rental property images by room type and bed configuration, improving traveler understanding of spatial layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of structured categorization in vacation rental property images makes it difficult for travelers to understand spatial layouts, especially with multiple rooms of the same type.

Method: A computationally efficient pipeline combines supervised room-type detection, overlap detection, clustering, and a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to group images and identify bed types.

Result: The pipeline outperforms existing methods like contrastive learning and clustering with pretrained embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively organizes property images, aiding travelers in comprehending spatial layouts and sleeping configurations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

*Mohamad Dabboussi, Malo Huard, Yann Gousseau, Pietro Gori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised pipeline for multi-view X-ray correspondence, using synthetic data and transformers, improves fracture detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods lack robust multi-view X-ray correspondence, which is vital for clinical diagnosis.

Method: Uses synthetic X-ray views (DRRs) from CT volumes and a transformer-based approach to learn correspondences without manual annotation.

Result: Improves multi-view fracture classification performance on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Learning correspondences from synthetic data enhances real-world multi-view fracture detection.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in
multi-view fracture classification.

### [99] [Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00292)
*Ali Mammadov, Loïc Le Folgoc, Guillaume Hocquet, Pietro Gori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy is introduced to reduce performance variability in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods for WSI classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High variability in performance of MIL methods due to factors like weight initialization, batch ordering, and learning rate makes reliable comparison difficult.

Method: Train multiple models for a few epochs, average the most stable ones based on validation scores, and apply this fusion strategy to any MIL model.

Result: The approach reduces variability, simplifies hyperparameter tuning, improves reproducibility, and maintains computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively addresses performance variability in MIL methods for WSI classification, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization
of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution
and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying
Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller
patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a
(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution
for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high
variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15
AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL
methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight
initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To
address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL
methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most
stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be
applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also
simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining
computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI
classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies
and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

### [100] [An Improved U-Net Model for Offline handwriting signature denoising](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00365)
*Wanghui Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study introduces a U-net-based model with wavelet and PCA transforms to denoise offline handwriting signatures, improving clarity and recognition robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwriting signatures are crucial for identity recognition but suffer from noise in historical samples, complicating forensic analysis.

Method: The proposed model uses an improved U-net structure with discrete wavelet and PCA transforms to enhance noise suppression.

Result: The model outperforms traditional methods, improving image clarity and readability for signature analysis.

Conclusion: The model provides reliable technical support for signature recognition, addressing noise challenges in forensic appraisals.

Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are
widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial
contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In
forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures
requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which
are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials.
However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount
of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting
identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising
model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness
of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform
and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The
experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the
traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity
and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical
support for signature analysis and recognition.

### [101] [Beyond Low-Rank Tuning: Model Prior-Guided Rank Allocation for Effective Transfer in Low-Data and Large-Gap Regimes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00327)
*Chuyan Zhang, Kefan Wang, Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SR-LoRA improves LoRA by using stable rank for efficient rank allocation, outperforming adaptive LoRA variants in domain-gap tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed low-rank in LoRA limits adaptability in domain gaps; current adaptive methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses stable rank of pre-trained weights for layer-wise rank allocation, avoiding search costs.

Result: Outperforms adaptive LoRA variants in few-shot tasks with domain gaps, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: SR-LoRA offers a principled, efficient solution for rank allocation in LoRA, enhancing adaptability.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven effective in reducing computational
costs while maintaining performance comparable to fully fine-tuned foundation
models across various tasks. However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts
its adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks
are often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive
LoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or
selectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on
computationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches,
or additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable
Rank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the
stable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise
rank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic
dimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient
redistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring
additional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with
significant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent
adaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and
efficiency. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a scalable dataset synthesis method for depth-dependent defocus and optical aberrations, enabling effective generalization to real-world images without real-world fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of shallow depth of field in fixed-focus cameras and domain gaps in deep learning models due to unmatched optical aberrations and defocus properties.

Method: An efficient and scalable dataset synthesis approach that models depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations without relying on real-world data.

Result: A network trained on low-resolution synthetic images generalizes effectively to high-resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the domain gap and offers a practical solution for fixed-focus camera systems.

Abstract: Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of
field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This
limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those
used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to
form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and
defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained
on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well
in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable
dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world
data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially
varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the
scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes
effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated lesion tracking in temporal mammograms is challenging but crucial for monitoring breast cancer progression and early diagnosis.

Method: MammoTracker uses a coarse-to-fine strategy with three modules: global search, local search, and score refinement. A new dataset with 730 cases and 20000 lesion pairs supports training and evaluation.

Result: The framework achieves 0.455 average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, outperforming baseline models by 8%.

Conclusion: MammoTracker shows promise for enhancing CAD-based lesion progression analysis, and the dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate lesion tracking in temporal mammograms is essential for monitoring
breast cancer progression and facilitating early diagnosis. However, automated
lesion correspondence across exams remains a challenges in computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) systems, limiting their effectiveness. We propose MammoTracker,
a mask-guided lesion tracking framework that automates lesion localization
across consecutively exams. Our approach follows a coarse-to-fine strategy
incorporating three key modules: global search, local search, and score
refinement. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we introduce a new
dataset with curated prior-exam annotations for 730 mass and calcification
cases from the public EMBED mammogram dataset, yielding over 20000 lesion
pairs, making it the largest known resource for temporal lesion tracking in
mammograms. Experimental results demonstrate that MammoTracker achieves 0.455
average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baseline models by 8%,
highlighting its potential to enhance CAD-based lesion progression analysis.

### [104] [Customizable ROI-Based Deep Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00373)
*Ian Jin, Fanxin Xia, Feng Ding, Xinfeng Zhang, Meiqin Liu, Yao Zhao, Weisi Lin, Lili Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A customizable ROI-based deep image compression method is proposed, allowing users to define ROI via text and adjust quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ROI-based compression lacks flexibility for diverse user preferences and fixed ROI definitions.

Method: Introduces Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA), Customizable Value Assign (CVA), and Latent Mask Attention (LMA) modules for flexible ROI customization and quality management.

Result: Effectively supports customizable ROI definition and quality trade-offs, improving user adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm successfully addresses customization needs in ROI-based image compression.

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by
prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users
(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,
ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various
preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require
different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image
compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack
effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.
This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image
compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,
which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just
inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder
controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)
mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users
instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off
between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)
module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent
Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused
in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of
the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses
the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as
the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

TL;DR: A study repurposes a text-to-video model to simulate human-environment interactions by inferring affordances from a single scene image, without explicit conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of video generation models as interactive world simulators by predicting human-environment interactions.

Method: Fine-tune a text-to-video model to insert a person into a scene based on a prompt, ensuring coherence and affordance, using cross-attention heatmaps for analysis.

Result: The model successfully infers human affordance for video generation without labeled datasets or explicit conditions.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video models inherently perceive affordances, enabling interactive world simulation without additional labeled data.

Abstract: Can a video generation model be repurposed as an interactive world simulator?
We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by
teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and
a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person
into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization,
and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video
generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a
single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body
poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can
uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without
labeled affordance datasets.

*Xin Luo, Menglin Zhang, Yunwei Lan, Tianyu Zhang, Rui Li, Chang Liu, Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent-PMRF improves face restoration by reformulating PMRF in VAE latent space, aligning better with human perception and achieving faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The pixel-space approach of PMRF limits alignment with human perception, prompting the need for a latent-space solution.

Method: Latent-PMRF uses a VAE's latent space to define source distributions, bounding distortion by reconstruction error and optimizing for perception.

Result: Latent-PMRF outperforms PMRF with a 5.79X speedup in FID and better perceptual-distortion tradeoff.

Conclusion: Latent-PMRF offers superior face restoration by leveraging latent space and efficient VAE design, advancing the PD-tradeoff.

Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face
restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve
minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean
Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution
is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its
pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human
perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between
two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which
reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE),
facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By
defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum
distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's
reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our
proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and
restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the
superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to
existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a
5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as
open-source.

TL;DR: MOVi-MC-AC is a new dataset for amodal segmentation and content completion, featuring multi-camera views and ground-truth amodal content, with 5.8 million labeled object instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack multi-camera perspectives and ground-truth amodal content, limiting research in object detection, tracking, and segmentation.

Method: The dataset simulates cluttered household scenes in multi-camera video, providing consistent object IDs across frames and cameras, and includes ground-truth amodal content labels.

Result: MOVi-MC-AC is the largest amodal segmentation dataset and the first to offer ground-truth amodal content, with 5.8 million labeled instances.

Conclusion: The dataset advances research in amodal segmentation and content completion by addressing gaps in multi-camera settings and providing high-quality labels.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors
to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until
now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the
possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce
MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the
largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered
scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.
MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,
and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for
computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be
identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in
both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic
video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations
between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion
patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in
which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In
the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with
amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely
on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do
not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC
provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the
amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth
amodal content. The full dataset is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMM-JND, a concept to quantify visual blind spots in large multimodal models (LMMs), and presents VPA-JND, a dataset to study these limitations. It highlights gaps in LMMs' visual perception compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic study on perceptual boundaries in LMMs and uncover their visual blind spots, which could impact security and efficiency.

Method: Proposes LMM-JND and its determination pipeline, constructs the VPA-JND dataset (21.5k images, 489k stimuli), and evaluates LMMs like GPT-4o and InternVL2.5.

Result: Reveals significant visual perception gaps in LMMs compared to humans, with notable struggles in basic comparison tasks. Also identifies correlations between vision/language backbones and performance.

Conclusion: LMM-JND is a valuable metric for studying LMMs, and its predictability is crucial for security. The work provides tools and insights for future LMM refinement.

Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual
system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work
has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a
scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across
multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly
advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted
capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual
defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential
security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an
initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots
in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new
concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting
uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,
we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named
VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12
distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where
state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle
with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level
visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language
backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that
may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together,
our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective
for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CGEarthEye, a high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation model (RSVFM) for the Jilin-1 satellite, leveraging a 15-million-scale SSL dataset and achieving SOTA performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited accessibility of ultra-high-resolution RS imagery hinders RSVFM progress. The Jilin-1 constellation's abundant data offers an opportunity to address this gap.

Method: Developed CGEarthEye with five backbones (2.1B parameters) and JLSSD dataset (15M samples). Used seasonal, augmentation, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on 10 benchmark datasets across four RS tasks, with superior feature visualization, convergence, and efficiency.

Conclusion: CGEarthEye's capabilities can enhance Jilin-1 data applications in Earth Observation, demonstrating its potential for broader RS advancements.

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of
intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model
research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various
domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility
and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited
acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have
constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation
models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite
constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level
image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically
designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with
different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the
representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the
first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset
featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single
year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling
strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based
contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.
Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS
tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior
characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter
efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the
exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader
and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

*Xingjun Wang, Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with better initialization, optimization, and density control for high-fidelity real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS relies on accurate initialization and struggles with optimizing unstructured Gaussian distributions and adaptive density control.

Method: Proposes geometry-guided initialization, surface-aligned optimization, and dynamic adaptive density control.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity real-time rendering with superior visual quality in complex scenes.

Conclusion: The method outperforms or matches state-of-the-art techniques in real-time high-fidelity rendering.

Abstract: We propose a method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)~\cite{Kerbl2023},
addressing challenges in initialization, optimization, and density control.
Gaussian Splatting is an alternative for rendering realistic images while
supporting real-time performance, and it has gained popularity due to its
explicit 3D Gaussian representation. However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate
initialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian
distributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control
mechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided
initialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and
faster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy
to refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with
the surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive
density control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional
complexity, for visual fidelity. These innovations enable our method to achieve
high-fidelity real-time rendering and significant improvements in visual
quality, even in complex scenes. Our method demonstrates comparable or superior
results to state-of-the-art methods, rendering high-fidelity images in real
time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATLI, a method for OOD detection that combines the maximum logit with adaptive top-k logits, outperforming MaxLogit and other state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often overconfidently predict OOD samples, necessitating better detection methods for safety.

Method: Proposes ATLI, which adaptively selects and integrates top-k logits with the maximum logit for OOD detection.

Result: ATLI reduces FPR95 by 6.73% over MaxLogit and 2.67% over other methods on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: ATLI is a powerful and adaptive approach for improving OOD detection in neural networks.

Abstract: Neural networks often make overconfident predictions from out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples. Detection of OOD data is therefore crucial to improve the safety
of machine learning. The simplest and most powerful method for OOD detection is
MaxLogit, which uses the model's maximum logit to provide an OOD score. We have
discovered that, in addition to the maximum logit, some other logits are also
useful for OOD detection. Based on this finding, we propose a new method called
ATLI (Adaptive Top-k Logits Integration), which adaptively determines effective
top-k logits that are specific to each model and combines the maximum logit
with the other top-k logits. In this study we evaluate our proposed method
using ImageNet-1K benchmark. Extensive experiments showed our proposed method
to reduce the false positive rate (FPR95) by 6.73% compared to the MaxLogit
approach, and decreased FPR95 by an additional 2.67% compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

*Xin Yang, Ruiming Du, Hanyang Huang, Jiayang Xie, Pengyao Xie, Leisen Fang, Ziyue Guo, Nanjun Jiang, Yu Jiang, Haiyan Cen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlantSegNeRF is a novel method for high-precision organ segmentation of plant point clouds from multi-view RGB images, outperforming existing techniques in accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for plant organ segmentation lack resolution, accuracy, and generalizability across species.

Method: PlantSegNeRF uses 2D instance segmentation, instance matching, and an implicit scene (NeRF) to generate high-precision instance point clouds.

Result: Outperforms common methods by 16.1-24.2% in semantic segmentation metrics and 11.7-38.2% in instance segmentation metrics.

Conclusion: Provides a high-throughput solution for organ-level plant phenotyping and supports large-scale plant science models.

Abstract: Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the
high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits.
Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on
segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ
segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and
generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a
novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF),
aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from
multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF
performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate
instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance
IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a
specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to
render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance
information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision
plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved
that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the
commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%,
17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the
second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly,
PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance
segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements
of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively.
This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a
high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of
large-scale models in plant science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedDiff-FT fine-tunes a diffusion model for efficient medical image generation, ensuring anatomical coherence and diversity, improving segmentation performance by 1% Dice score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of high-quality medical training data and limitations of existing diffusion models in medical imaging.

Method: Fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model with dynamic adaptive guiding masks, stochastic mask generation, and automated quality assessment.

Result: Improves segmentation performance by 1% Dice score on five medical datasets.

Conclusion: MedDiff-FT offers a practical, efficient solution for medical data augmentation, balancing quality, diversity, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning for medical image segmentation are often
limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data.While diffusion models
provide a potential solution by generating synthetic images, their
effectiveness in medical imaging remains constrained due to their reliance on
large-scale medical datasets and the need for higher image quality. To address
these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image
generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce
medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a
data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask
enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a
lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical
randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol
filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask
corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation
datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's
segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework
effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational
efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation. The

### [115] [Learning Dense Feature Matching via Lifting Single 2D Image to 3D Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00392)
*Yingping Liang, Yutao Hu, Wenqi Shao, Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework, Lift to Match (L2M), improves feature matching by leveraging 3D-aware features from single-view images, enhancing generalization across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature matching methods rely on scarce multi-view datasets and lack 3D-awareness, limiting their robustness in diverse scenarios.

Method: L2M uses a 3D-aware feature encoder (stage 1) and a feature decoder with novel-view rendering (stage 2) to learn from single-view images.

Result: The method achieves superior generalization in zero-shot benchmarks, demonstrating robust feature matching.

Conclusion: L2M effectively addresses limitations of conventional methods by incorporating 3D geometry and large-scale synthetic data.

Abstract: Feature matching plays a fundamental role in many computer vision tasks, yet
existing methods heavily rely on scarce and clean multi-view image collections,
which constrains their generalization to diverse and challenging scenarios.
Moreover, conventional feature encoders are typically trained on single-view 2D
images, limiting their capacity to capture 3D-aware correspondences. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that lifts 2D images to 3D space,
named as \textbf{Lift to Match (L2M)}, taking full advantage of large-scale and
diverse single-view images. To be specific, in the first stage, we learn a
3D-aware feature encoder using a combination of multi-view image synthesis and
3D feature Gaussian representation, which injects 3D geometry knowledge into
the encoder. In the second stage, a novel-view rendering strategy, combined
with large-scale synthetic data generation from single-view images, is employed
to learn a feature decoder for robust feature matching, thus achieving
generalization across diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method achieves superior generalization across zero-shot evaluation
benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robust
feature matching.

*Xin Xu, Eibe Frank, Geoffrey Holmes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MIV-head, a novel approach for cross-domain few-shot learning without fine-tuning backbones, achieving competitive accuracy with lower adaptation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of few-shot learning with frozen backbones, which is common in practical scenarios, by improving low-quality static embeddings.

Method: Proposes the MIV-head, a backbone-agnostic and efficient classification head, trained on few-shot target domain data for meta-testing.

Result: MIV-head outperforms adapter methods and traditional classification heads in accuracy while being more cost-effective.

Conclusion: The MIV-head is a viable solution for cross-domain few-shot learning without backbone fine-tuning, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that
fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible
-- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the
low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones
leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of
multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we
introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head",
akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and
computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when
trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong
performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without
fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting
under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for
cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on
ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when
compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods
applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation
cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind
in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components
of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

*Jingyi Pan, Dan Xu, Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGA3D is a unified 3D inpainting pipeline using diffusion models for consistent appearance and geometry, addressing challenges like view robustness and inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in unified 3D inpainting include lack of robustness in single-reference methods, appearance inconsistency, and geometry inconsistency.

Method: DiGA3D uses multiple reference views, Attention Feature Propagation (AFP), and Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss for consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiGA3D's effectiveness in various 3D inpainting tasks.

Conclusion: DiGA3D provides a robust and versatile solution for 3D inpainting with improved consistency.

Abstract: Developing a unified pipeline that enables users to remove, re-texture, or
replace objects in a versatile manner is crucial for text-guided 3D inpainting.
However, there are still challenges in performing multiple 3D inpainting tasks
within a unified framework: 1) Single reference inpainting methods lack
robustness when dealing with views that are far from the reference view. 2)
Appearance inconsistency arises when independently inpainting multi-view images
with 2D diffusion priors; 3) Geometry inconsistency limits performance when
there are significant geometric changes in the inpainting regions. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce DiGA3D, a novel and versatile 3D inpainting
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to propagate consistent appearance and
geometry in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, DiGA3D develops a robust strategy
for selecting multiple reference views to reduce errors during propagation.
Next, DiGA3D designs an Attention Feature Propagation (AFP) mechanism that
propagates attention features from the selected reference views to other views
via diffusion models to maintain appearance consistency. Furthermore, DiGA3D
introduces a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss to
further improve the geometric consistency of inpainted 3D scenes. Extensive
experiments on multiple 3D inpainting tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. The project page is available at https://rorisis.github.io/DiGA3D/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMER struggles with complex formula structures and layouts; frequency domain analysis is proposed to assist structural recognition.

Method: Incorporates DCT-based frequency domain analysis into HMER, creating the MFH method.

Result: MFH-CoMER achieves 61.66%/62.07%/63.72% accuracy on CROHME 2014/2016/2019 test sets.

Conclusion: Frequency domain information enhances HMER performance, as demonstrated by MFH's consistent improvements.

Abstract: Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) suffers from complex
formula structures and character layouts in sequence prediction. In this paper,
we incorporate frequency domain analysis into HMER and propose a method that
marries frequency domain with HMER (MFH), leveraging the discrete cosine
transform (DCT). We emphasize the structural analysis assistance of frequency
information for recognizing mathematical formulas. When implemented on various
baseline models, our network exhibits a consistent performance enhancement,
demonstrating the efficacy of frequency domain information. Experiments show
that our MFH-CoMER achieves noteworthy accuracyrates of 61.66%/62.07%/63.72% on
the CROHME 2014/2016/2019 test sets. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATSTrack addresses misalignment in Visual-Language Tracking by aligning temporal and spatial scales of inputs, improving feature modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between visual and language inputs due to target movement and inherent scale differences hinders tracking performance.

Method: Decomposes language descriptions into phrases with temporal/spatial attributes, modifies features finely, and uses a Visual-Language token for guidance.

Result: ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces misalignment and improves tracking by addressing scale differences.

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment
between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement.
Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to
preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor
ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the
temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs.
To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances
the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and
\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as
\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into
phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial
correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained
manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified
linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract
visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby
reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental
results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to
existing methods. Our code will be released.

TL;DR: MS-TTA improves CLIP's test-time adaptation by refining all test samples with kNN Mean-Shift, outperforming existing methods without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP struggle with distribution shifts at test time, and existing TTA methods ignore low-confidence samples.

Method: Proposes MS-TTA, a training-free approach using kNN Mean-Shift to refine features beyond CLIP's space, enhancing compactness and separability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods on OOD and cross-dataset benchmarks, achieving robust adaptation.

Conclusion: MS-TTA offers a simple yet effective training-free solution for improving CLIP's test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Visual-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong generalization but
struggle with distribution shifts at test time. Existing training-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods operate strictly within CLIP's original
feature space, relying on high-confidence samples while overlooking the
potential of low-confidence ones. We propose MS-TTA, a training-free approach
that enhances feature representations beyond CLIP's space using a single-step
k-nearest neighbors (kNN) Mean-Shift. By refining all test samples, MS-TTA
improves feature compactness and class separability, leading to more stable
adaptation. Additionally, a cache of refined embeddings further enhances
inference by providing Mean Shift enhanced logits. Extensive evaluations on OOD
and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that MS-TTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free TTA methods, achieving robust adaptation without
requiring additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bisecle is a video-language continual learning method inspired by hippocampal memory mechanisms, addressing catastrophic forgetting and update conflicts in VLMs through multi-directional supervision and contrastive prompt learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos evolve continuously, requiring VLMs to adapt without prohibitive computational costs, but existing methods struggle with forgetting and conflicts in parameter-efficient updates.

Method: Bisecle uses multi-directional supervision for cross-modal relationships and contrastive prompt learning to isolate task-specific knowledge, mimicking hippocampal memory processes.

Result: Bisecle mitigates forgetting and improves cross-task generalization on VideoQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Bisecle offers a robust and efficient solution for continual learning in video understanding tasks by leveraging hippocampal-inspired mechanisms.

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in
video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as
continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable
glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data
distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational
costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters
is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new
challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large
multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update
conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient
continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly
efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the
rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this
work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a
multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal
relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate
task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and
separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex
experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video
understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,
demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task
generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

*Ying Guo, Xi Liu, Cheng Zhen, Pengfei Yan, Xiaoming Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ARIG, an autoregressive frame-wise framework for real-time interactive head generation, addressing limitations of clip-wise methods by using diffusion-based motion prediction and emphasizing interactive and conversational state understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face-to-face communication drives the need for realistic virtual agents with listening and speaking capabilities, but existing methods struggle with real-time performance and realism due to signal acquisition and behavioral understanding issues.

Method: ARIG uses a non-vector-quantized autoregressive process for motion prediction, leveraging diffusion for continuous space accuracy. It incorporates interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and conversational state understanding (CSU) for realism.

Result: Experiments confirm ARIG's effectiveness in real-time generation with improved interaction realism.

Conclusion: ARIG advances interactive head generation by combining autoregressive prediction with diffusion and contextual understanding, achieving real-time and realistic results.

Abstract: Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the
research on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion
responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or
motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise
generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods
have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral
understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time
and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based
frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with
better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion
prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index
prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure,
achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction
realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed
conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track
dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through
bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over
long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU
to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that
exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final
progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the
effectiveness of our model.

TL;DR: Proposes ADAptation, an unsupervised Active Learning framework for domain adaptation, using diffusion models and dual-scoring to handle distribution shifts in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance drops in deep learning models due to distribution shifts between training and test domains, reducing annotation costs.

Method: Uses diffusion models for domain homogenization, hypersphere-constrained contrastive learning, and dual-scoring for sample selection.

Result: Outperforms existing AL methods on breast ultrasound datasets, showing effectiveness in clinical domain adaptation.

Conclusion: ADAptation is a robust solution for domain adaptation with limited annotation budgets, validated across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning-based diagnostic models often suffer performance drops due to
distribution shifts between training (source) and test (target) domains.
Collecting and labeling sufficient target domain data for model retraining
represents an optimal solution, yet is limited by time and scarce resources.
Active learning (AL) offers an efficient approach to reduce annotation costs
while maintaining performance, but struggles to handle the challenge posed by
distribution variations across different datasets. In this study, we propose a
novel unsupervised Active learning framework for Domain Adaptation, named
ADAptation, which efficiently selects informative samples from multi-domain
data pools under limited annotation budget. As a fundamental step, our method
first utilizes the distribution homogenization capabilities of diffusion models
to bridge cross-dataset gaps by translating target images into source-domain
style. We then introduce two key innovations: (a) a hypersphere-constrained
contrastive learning network for compact feature clustering, and (b) a
dual-scoring mechanism that quantifies and balances sample uncertainty and
representativeness. Extensive experiments on four breast ultrasound datasets
(three public and one in-house/multi-center) across five common deep
classifiers demonstrate that our method surpasses existing strong AL-based
competitors, validating its effectiveness and generalization for clinical
domain adaptation. The code is available at the anonymized link:

*Fenil R. Doshi, Thomas Fel, Talia Konkle, George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Configural Shape Score (CSS) to evaluate models' ability to recognize objects based on global part arrangement, showing top performance in self-supervised and language-aligned transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models focus on local texture cues, neglecting global shape configurations, which limits robustness and human-like recognition.

Method: CSS measures recognition of Object-Anagram pairs, testing global part arrangement. Evaluated 86 models, including convolutional, transformer, and hybrid architectures.

Result: High-CSS models (e.g., DINOv2, SigLIP2, EVA-CLIP) rely on long-range interactions, with a U-shaped integration profile and mid-depth transition from local to global coding.

Conclusion: Robust vision systems should integrate both local-texture and global configural shape, avoiding artificial trade-offs between shape and texture.

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the
configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest
local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on
shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in
opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that
models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and
obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore
recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence,
operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the
ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local
texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object
categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii)
uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised
and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and
EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes
reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions:
radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive
U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a
mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at
chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that
configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we
propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision
systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture,
but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate
both local-texture and global configural shape.

*Yongzhen Wang, Liangliang Chen, Bingwen Hu, Heng Liu, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Laplace-Mamba integrates Laplace frequency prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSM-based approaches struggle with localized structures and high-dimensional data, leading to poor recovery of fine image features.

Method: Uses Laplace decomposition to split the image into low and high-frequency components, processed via dual pathways: SSMs for global context and CNNs for local details.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration quality and efficiency across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Laplace-Mamba effectively addresses SSM limitations, offering superior performance in image dehazing.

Abstract: Recent progress in image restoration has underscored Spatial State Models
(SSMs) as powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies, owing to their
appealing linear complexity and computational efficiency. However, SSM-based
approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend
to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting
in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency
prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing.
Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into
low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components
representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized
processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs
for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to
refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios.
Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving
downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory,
thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency. The

*JianChao Zhao, Songlin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExPaMoE introduces an expandable parallel Mixture-of-Experts framework to tackle feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting in Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA), outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods struggle with feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting due to shared model parameters across domains, especially under large or non-stationary shifts.

Method: ExPaMoE uses a dual-branch expert design for domain-general and domain-specific knowledge separation, dynamically expanding experts via a Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator (SODD).

Result: ExPaMoE outperforms prior methods on benchmarks like CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC, and introduces ImageNet++ for realistic CTTA evaluation.

Conclusion: ExPaMoE demonstrates robustness, scalability, and resistance to forgetting, making it a superior solution for CTTA challenges.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt
on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts.
However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across
all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic
forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address
this limitation, we propose \textbf{ExPaMoE}, a novel framework based on an
\emph{Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts} architecture. ExPaMoE decouples
domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design
with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool
based on a \emph{Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator} (SODD) that
detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse
CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including
CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic
segmentation. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{ImageNet++}, a large-scale and
realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to
better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE
consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability,
and resistance to forgetting.

*Haoran Lou, Chunxiao Fan, Ziyan Liu, Yuexin Wu, Xinxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-SP enhances multimodal large language models by adding six spatial visual tokens to improve local feature representation, outperforming LLaVA-1.5 with minimal latency increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-ViT struggles with local patch relationships, weakening visual representation in MLLMs. LLaVA-SP addresses this by enriching visual features with spatial tokens.

Method: Proposes a novel Projector using convolutional kernels to derive spatial tokens, simulating two ordering approaches. Introduces two variants (Cropping and Pooling) for diverse visual tasks.

Result: LLaVA-SP outperforms LLaVA-1.5 in multimodal benchmarks with nearly identical inference latency.

Conclusion: LLaVA-SP effectively enhances visual representation in MLLMs, offering improved performance without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: The architecture of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) commonly
connects a vision encoder, often based on CLIP-ViT, to a large language model.
While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to
model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual
representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of
MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which \textbf{ only adds six spatial
visual tokens} to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual
representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel
Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens
from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches:
``from central region to global" and ``from abstract to specific". Then, a
cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information,
enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:
LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive
cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through
adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding
tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,
achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple
tasks with nearly identical inference latency. The code and models are

*Yunfei Xie, Yuxuan Cheng, Juncheng Wu, Haoyu Zhang, Yuyin Zhou, Shoudong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework, SCING, improves cross-modal alignment in person ReID by introducing lightweight modules and a dual-path training strategy, achieving efficient performance without heavy adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting vision-language models in ReID tasks are complex or ignore cross-modal interaction, leading to inefficiency or poor alignment.

Method: SCING uses Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP) for dynamic feature injection and Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) for robust feature alignment under perturbations.

Result: The method outperforms on benchmarks like Market1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SCING offers a simple, effective solution for cross-modal alignment in ReID, eliminating heavy adapters while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in adapting vision-language pre-training models like CLIP
for person re-identification (ReID) tasks often rely on complex adapter design
or modality-specific tuning while neglecting cross-modal interaction, leading
to high computational costs or suboptimal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Selective
Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (SCING) that enhances cross-modal alignment and
robustness against real-world perturbations. Our method introduces two key
innovations: Firstly, we proposed Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP), a
lightweight module that dynamically injects discriminative visual features into
text prompts via a cross-modal gating mechanism. Moreover, the proposed
Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) is a dual-path training
strategy that enforces invariant feature alignment under random image
perturbations by regularizing consistency between original and augmented
cross-modal embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular
benchmarks covering Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-REID,
and P-DukeMTMC, which demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed
method. Notably, our framework eliminates heavy adapters while maintaining
efficient inference, achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and
computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

*Ruize Cui, Jiaan Zhang, Jialun Pei, Kai Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoNet is a topology-constrained learning framework for laparoscopic liver landmark detection, combining RGB texture and depth-informed topological structures with adaptive feature fusion and topological constraints for high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver landmarks are vital for surgical guidance but challenging to detect due to tubular structures and intraoperative deformations.

Method: Uses a snake-CNN dual-path encoder for RGB and depth data, a boundary-aware topology fusion module, and topological constraint losses (center-line and persistence).

Result: Achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency on L3D and P2ILF datasets.

Conclusion: TopoNet shows strong potential for clinical use in laparoscopic liver surgery.

Abstract: Liver landmarks provide crucial anatomical guidance to the surgeon during
laparoscopic liver surgery to minimize surgical risk. However, the tubular
structural properties of landmarks and dynamic intraoperative deformations pose
significant challenges for automatic landmark detection. In this study, we
introduce TopoNet, a novel topology-constrained learning framework for
laparoscopic liver landmark detection. Our framework adopts a snake-CNN
dual-path encoder to simultaneously capture detailed RGB texture information
and depth-informed topological structures. Meanwhile, we propose a
boundary-aware topology fusion (BTF) module, which adaptively merges RGB-D
features to enhance edge perception while preserving global topology.
Additionally, a topological constraint loss function is embedded, which
contains a center-line constraint loss and a topological persistence loss to
ensure homotopy equivalence between predictions and labels. Extensive
experiments on L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that TopoNet achieves
outstanding accuracy and computational complexity, highlighting the potential
for clinical applications in laparoscopic liver surgery. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/cuiruize/TopoNet.

*Djamahl Etchegaray, Yuxia Fu, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box-QAymo introduces a dataset for evaluating VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing gaps in localized user-driven queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack interpretability for real-world driving scenarios, especially for localized user intent.

Method: A box-referring dataset with hierarchical evaluation (binary checks, attribute prediction, motion understanding, spatiotemporal reasoning) and crowd-sourced annotations.

Result: Reveals limitations in VLMs for perception tasks, emphasizing the gap in real-world performance.

Conclusion: Box-QAymo lays groundwork for more robust, interpretable autonomous driving communication.

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

*Feng Lin, Marco Chen, Haokui Zhang, Xiaotian Yu, Guangming Lu, Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attention Ablation Technique (AAT) to improve CLIP's performance by identifying and suppressing detrimental attention heads in its image encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's robust performance is sometimes hindered by certain attention heads, and ablating them could enhance downstream task performance.

Method: Proposes AAT, a method to manipulate attention weights and suppress harmful heads, using two tailored strategies for different scenarios.

Result: AAT improves downstream tasks, achieving up to 11.1% higher recall in cross-modal retrieval with no added inference cost.

Conclusion: AAT effectively refines vision-language models like CLIP by optimizing attention heads, demonstrating practical benefits.

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While
CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we
hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final
representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream
tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method,
called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of
specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two
alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT
systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance
representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves
downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up
to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight
the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models
with virtually no increase in inference cost.

### [132] [LOD-GS: Level-of-Detail-Sensitive 3D Gaussian Splatting for Detail Conserved Anti-Aliasing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00554)
*Zhenya Yang, Bingchen Gong, Kai Chen, Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOD-GS is a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that dynamically predicts optimal filtering strength, addressing aliasing artifacts while avoiding under-filtering and over-smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aliasing artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting persist despite existing low-pass filtering methods, which are insensitive to sampling rates.

Method: LOD-GS introduces basis functions to model appearance variations based on sampling rate, optimizing parameters end-to-end with 3D Gaussians.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and effectively eliminates aliasing, validated on public and new synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: LOD-GS outperforms existing methods by dynamically adapting filtering strength, and the open-sourced code and dataset support further research.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent
challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate
aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often
resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this
limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework
for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering
strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of
basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to
model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These
basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an
end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and
camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on
down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation,
overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive
assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at
varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our
newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering
quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been
open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ONLY is a training-free decoding method for LVLMs that reduces hallucination by amplifying key textual information using a text-to-visual entropy ratio, enabling efficient real-time deployment with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucination, limiting reliable real-world deployment. Existing contrastive decoding methods are slow due to multiple queries.

Method: ONLY uses a single query and one-layer intervention, selectively amplifying crucial textual information via a text-to-visual entropy ratio.

Result: ONLY outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks with minimal effort and cost.

Conclusion: ONLY offers an efficient, real-time solution to LVLM hallucination, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm
for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.
Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of
multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which
introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable
deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive
decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original
LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,
these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response
generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that
requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,
enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual
outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a
text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort
and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

*Kai Zhou, Shuhai Zhang, Zeng You, Jinwu Hu, Mingkui Tan, Fei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PGFA, a prototype-guided feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, addressing limitations in existing methods and achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in generalizing from known to unseen skeleton-based human actions, with prior methods suffering from insufficient skeleton feature discrimination and alignment bias.

Method: PGFA employs an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive training framework for better skeleton-text alignment and a prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate distribution discrepancies.

Result: PGFA outperforms the top competitor (SMIE) with absolute accuracy gains of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: PGFA effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, demonstrating superior performance in zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to classify unseen
skeleton-based human actions without prior exposure to such categories during
training. This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in
generalizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use
two-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories
using cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text
features, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text
alignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is
hindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed
skeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective
skeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and
unseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided
feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,
termed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive
training framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient
discrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a
prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact
of the distribution discrepancy during testing. We provide a theoretical
analysis to support our prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy and
empirically evaluate our overall PGFA on three well-known datasets. Compared
with the top competitor SMIE method, our PGFA achieves absolute accuracy
improvements of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD
datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to detect objects not seen during training is critical for real-world applications, as traditional methods assume a closed set of classes, limiting generalization.

Method: The paper reviews benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and methodologies for OOD detection, including model structures, uncertainty indicators, and calibration techniques.

Result: A comparative analysis of OOD detection approaches is presented, highlighting strengths and limitations. Future directions like adversarial robustness and 3D integration are identified.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a guide for researchers, offering insights into OOD detection to advance reliable and robust AI systems, with a focus on emerging 3D applications.

Abstract: The ability to detect objects that are not prevalent in the training set is a
critical capability in many 3D applications, including autonomous driving.
Machine learning methods for object recognition often assume that all object
categories encountered during inference belong to a closed set of classes
present in the training data. This assumption limits generalization to the real
world, as objects not seen during training may be misclassified or entirely
ignored. As part of reliable AI, OOD detection identifies inputs that deviate
significantly from the training distribution. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of OOD detection within the broader scope of trustworthy
and uncertain AI. We begin with key use cases across diverse domains, introduce
benchmark datasets spanning multiple modalities, and discuss evaluation
metrics. Next, we present a comparative analysis of OOD detection
methodologies, exploring model structures, uncertainty indicators, and
distributional distance taxonomies, alongside uncertainty calibration
techniques. Finally, we highlight promising research directions, including
adversarially robust OOD detection and failure identification, particularly
relevant to 3D applications. The paper offers both theoretical and practical
insights into OOD detection, showcasing emerging research opportunities such as
3D vision integration. These insights help new researchers navigate the field
more effectively, contributing to the development of reliable, safe, and robust

TL;DR: ReStraV detects AI-generated videos by analyzing temporal curvature and stepwise distance in neural representations, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic synthetic videos challenges content authentication, requiring better detection methods.

Method: Uses a pre-trained vision transformer (DINOv2) to quantify temporal curvature and stepwise distance, training a classifier on these metrics.

Result: Achieves 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ReStraV offers an efficient, effective solution for AI-generated video detection, leveraging neural representation geometry.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic
videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising
urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with
generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose
ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish
natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening"
hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight
in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected
geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer
(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the
model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for
each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos
exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to
real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark),
substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is
computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection
solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation
geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sim-MPNet, a network for medical image segmentation, leveraging grandmother cells' recognition capabilities. It includes DMW-LA for dynamic feature matching and DS-GIM for feature exploration, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by grandmother cells in macaque V1, the study aims to enhance medical image segmentation by leveraging complex shape recognition.

Method: Proposes Sim-MPNet with DMW-LA for dynamic feature matching and DS-GIM for feature distribution analysis using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.

Result: Sim-MPNet achieves superior segmentation performance on four public datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves segmentation by dynamically learning and updating category features, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: In recent years, it has been found that "grandmother cells" in the primary
visual cortex (V1) of macaques can directly recognize visual input with complex
shapes. This inspires us to examine the value of these cells in promoting the
research of medical image segmentation. In this paper, we design a Similarity
Memory Prior Network (Sim-MPNet) for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a Dynamic Memory Weights-Loss Attention (DMW-LA), which matches and
remembers the category features of specific lesions or organs in medical images
through the similarity memory prior in the prototype memory bank, thus helping
the network to learn subtle texture changes between categories. DMW-LA also
dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss
Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly
extract category features. In addition, we propose the Double-Similarity Global
Internal Enhancement Module (DS-GIM) to deeply explore the internal differences
in the feature distribution of input data through cosine similarity and
euclidean distance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that
Sim-MPNet has better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/Sim-MPNet.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAER, a novel dataset for academic emotion recognition, and CLIP-CAER, a method combining facial and context cues using CLIP, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Academic emotion recognition is underexplored due to lack of datasets. The paper aims to address this gap by creating a diverse dataset and improving recognition accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce RAER, a dataset of 2,700 video clips from natural learning contexts, annotated by multiple annotators. They propose CLIP-CAER, leveraging CLIP to integrate facial and context cues.

Result: CLIP-CAER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of context in academic emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The study advances academic emotion recognition by providing a robust dataset and a context-aware method, demonstrating the significance of contextual cues.

Abstract: Academic emotion analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating students'
engagement and cognitive states during the learning process. This paper
addresses the challenge of automatically recognizing academic emotions through
facial expressions in real-world learning environments. While significant
progress has been made in facial expression recognition for basic emotions,
academic emotion recognition remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity
of publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAER, a novel
dataset comprising approximately 2,700 video clips collected from around 140
students in diverse, natural learning contexts such as classrooms, libraries,
laboratories, and dormitories, covering both classroom sessions and individual
study. Each clip was annotated independently by approximately ten annotators
using two distinct sets of academic emotion labels with varying granularity,
enhancing annotation consistency and reliability. To our knowledge, RAER is the
first dataset capturing diverse natural learning scenarios. Observing that
annotators naturally consider context cues-such as whether a student is looking
at a phone or reading a book-alongside facial expressions, we propose CLIP-CAER
(CLIP-based Context-aware Academic Emotion Recognition). Our method utilizes
learnable text prompts within the vision-language model CLIP to effectively
integrate facial expression and context cues from videos. Experimental results
demonstrate that CLIP-CAER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
video-based facial expression recognition methods, which are primarily designed
for basic emotions, emphasizing the crucial role of context in accurately
recognizing academic emotions. Project page: https://zgsfer.github.io/CAER

*Fernando Alonso-Fernandez, Talha Hanif Butt, Prayag Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates overtake detection in trucks using CAN bus data, testing ANN, RF, and SVM classifiers. Data diversity and multi-vehicle training improve performance, with score-level fusion achieving TNR=93% and TPR=86.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe overtaking in trucks is critical for accident prevention and traffic efficiency, requiring accurate prediction for ADAS.

Method: Used CAN bus data from five Volvo trucks, evaluated ANN, RF, and SVM classifiers, and applied score-level fusion for improved performance.

Result: Variability in traffic conditions affects classification; multi-vehicle training enhances generalization. Fusion achieved TNR=93% and TPR=86.5%.

Conclusion: Score-level fusion and diverse training data improve overtake detection accuracy, supporting ADAS applications.

Abstract: Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and
ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is
essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and
informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks
provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle
manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing
configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic
conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the
no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks
adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,
real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,
training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces
condition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification
accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per
vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields
the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an
accuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True
Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which
explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to
understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera
Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional
exterior mirrors.

TL;DR: World4Drive is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework using vision foundation models for self-supervised trajectory planning, eliminating costly perception annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning by constructing an informative driving world model via self-supervised learning.

Method: Extracts scene features using vision foundation models, generates multi-modal trajectories, predicts future states, and selects the best trajectory via a world model selector.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18.1% lower L2 error, 46.7% fewer collisions, and 3.75x faster training.

Conclusion: World4Drive demonstrates effective self-supervised planning without manual perception annotations, outperforming benchmarks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving directly generates planning trajectories from
raw sensor data, yet it typically relies on costly perception supervision to
extract scene information. A critical research challenge arises: constructing
an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free,
end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present
World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision
foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating
multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts
scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations
enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It
then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene
features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future
states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector
module to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception
annotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between
actual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the
latent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual
perception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim
benchmarks, demonstrating an 18.1\% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower
collision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence. Codes will be accessed at

### [141] [De-Simplifying Pseudo Labels to Enhancing Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00608)
*Zehua Fu, Chenguang Liu, Yuyu Chen, Jiaqi Zhou, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the performance gap between self-labeling and domain alignment methods in UDA for object detection, attributing it to simple-label bias, and proposes DeSimPL to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce reliance on labeled data in traffic and transportation object detection, and the underperformance of self-labeling methods compared to domain alignment due to simple-label bias.

Method: Proposes DeSimPL, which uses an instance-level memory bank for pseudo label updating, introduces adversarial samples, and employs an adaptive weighted loss to handle false positives.

Result: DeSimPL reduces simple samples during training, improving self-labeling detector performance, validated on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeSimPL effectively addresses simple-label bias, enhancing self-labeling methods in UDA for object detection.

Abstract: Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and
transportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in
acquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention.
UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which
achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity
due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the
limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate
performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high
proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as
the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo
Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level
memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then,
adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering
from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the
proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant
performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments
conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.

*Siyuan Yao, Rui Zhu, Ziqi Wang, Wenqi Ren, Yanyang Yan, Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMDATrack improves visual object tracking in adverse weather conditions using domain adaptation, a scenario generator, and custom adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tracking methods degrade in adverse weather due to domain shifts. UMDATrack aims to maintain performance in such conditions.

Method: Uses a controllable scenario generator for synthetic videos, a domain-customized adapter (DCA), and a target-aware confidence alignment module (TCA).

Result: Outperforms existing trackers significantly in adverse weather.

Conclusion: UMDATrack sets a new state-of-the-art for robust visual tracking in diverse weather conditions.

Abstract: Visual object tracking has gained promising progress in past decades. Most of
the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in
well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios
with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the
tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this
paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality
target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a
unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable
scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than
2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the
guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet
effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects'
representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant
model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between
source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment
module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UMDATrack can surpass existing advanced visual trackers and
lead new state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Z-Z188/UMDATrack.

### [143] [LoD-Loc v2: Aerial Visual Localization over Low Level-of-Detail City Models using Explicit Silhouette Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00659)
*Juelin Zhu, Shuaibang Peng, Long Wang, Hanlin Tan, Yu Liu, Maojun Zhang, Shen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoD-Loc v2 introduces a coarse-to-fine strategy for aerial visual localization over low-LoD city models, improving accuracy and enabling localization where previous methods failed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on high-LoD city models, but low-LoD models are more common and planned for nationwide use. Enabling localization with low-LoD models could expand drone applications in urban areas.

Method: LoD-Loc v2 uses building segmentation, a pose cost volume for coarse pose selection, and particle filtering for fine pose estimation.

Result: The method improves accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: LoD-Loc v2 advances aerial localization by supporting low-LoD models, broadening convergence, and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low
Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method
LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.
However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the
majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct
nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD
city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To
address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine
strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization
over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc
v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.
Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by
uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose
probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of
alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose
with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a
particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used
to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose
estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two
datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries
and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2
improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with
low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and
broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.

Motivation: Addressing the challenges of realistic and stable whole-body grasping, especially due to limited hand-object interaction data.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: Grasp Pose Generation, Temporal Infilling, and LiftUp Transformer. Includes data-efficient Generalized Pretraining for robust representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the GRAB dataset in coherence, stability, and visual realism.

Conclusion: The modular framework is effective for whole-body grasping and adaptable to other human-motion tasks.

Abstract: Accepted in the ICIP 2025
  We present a novel transformer-based framework for whole-body grasping that
addresses both pose generation and motion infilling, enabling realistic and
stable object interactions. Our pipeline comprises three stages: Grasp Pose
Generation for full-body grasp generation, Temporal Infilling for smooth motion
continuity, and a LiftUp Transformer that refines downsampled joints back to
high-resolution markers. To overcome the scarcity of hand-object interaction
data, we introduce a data-efficient Generalized Pretraining stage on large,
diverse motion datasets, yielding robust spatio-temporal representations
transferable to grasping tasks. Experiments on the GRAB dataset show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of coherence, stability,
and visual realism. The modular design also supports easy adaptation to other
human-motion applications.

*Keke Tang, Ziyong Du, Weilong Peng, Xiaofei Wang, Peican Zhu, Ligang Liu, Zhihong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CageAttack introduces a cage-based deformation framework for generating natural adversarial point clouds, balancing transferability, undefendability, and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on point clouds either limit transferability or introduce unnatural distortions, undermining plausibility.

Method: The framework constructs a cage around the target object, applies perturbations to cage vertices, and propagates these smoothly to the point cloud.

Result: CageAttack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seven 3D classifiers across three datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves superior balance in adversarial point cloud generation, ensuring natural deformations and high plausibility.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on point clouds often impose strict geometric constraints
to preserve plausibility; however, such constraints inherently limit
transferability and undefendability. While deformation offers an alternative,
existing unstructured approaches may introduce unnatural distortions, making
adversarial point clouds conspicuous and undermining their plausibility. In
this paper, we propose CageAttack, a cage-based deformation framework that
produces natural adversarial point clouds. It first constructs a cage around
the target object, providing a structured basis for smooth, natural-looking
deformation. Perturbations are then applied to the cage vertices, which
seamlessly propagate to the point cloud, ensuring that the resulting
deformations remain intrinsic to the object and preserve plausibility.
Extensive experiments on seven 3D deep neural network classifiers across three
datasets show that CageAttack achieves a superior balance among
transferability, undefendability, and plausibility, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be made public upon acceptance.

### [146] [Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00698)
*Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Yuang Ai, ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA) to address the performance gap between Linear Attention and Softmax Attention by incorporating Query magnitude, achieving efficient global modeling with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear Attention's linear complexity is advantageous for vision tasks but suffers performance degradation compared to Softmax Attention due to ignoring Query magnitude.

Method: Analyzes Linear Attention's formulation, identifies the Query magnitude issue, and proposes MALA to dynamically adapt attention scores by incorporating Query magnitude.

Result: MALA achieves strong performance across tasks like image classification, object detection, NLP, and more, closely resembling Softmax Attention's distribution.

Conclusion: MALA effectively bridges the performance gap between Linear and Softmax Attention while maintaining linear complexity, validated across diverse tasks.

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent
global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its
applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar
formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling
efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers
from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax
Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based
on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,
Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.
This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the
Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax
Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score
distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear
Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully
incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an
attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while
exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of
MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,
instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,
speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on
all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

TL;DR: BEV-VAE proposes a method for multi-view image generation in autonomous driving using a structured 3D representation, combining a multi-view image VAE and a latent diffusion transformer for consistent and controllable synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat multi-view image generation as a 2D task, lacking explicit 3D modeling, which is crucial for autonomous driving applications.

Method: BEV-VAE trains a multi-view image variational autoencoder (VAE) for a compact BEV latent space and uses a latent diffusion transformer for scene generation, supporting arbitrary views and optional 3D layouts.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 show strong performance in 3D consistent reconstruction and generation.

Conclusion: BEV-VAE provides a structured and effective approach for multi-view image generation in autonomous driving, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-view image generation in autonomous driving demands consistent 3D scene
understanding across camera views. Most existing methods treat this problem as
a 2D image set generation task, lacking explicit 3D modeling. However, we argue
that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially
for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent
and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image
variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then
generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports
arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D
layouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance
in both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation. The code is available at:

TL;DR: TopoStreamer improves lane segment topology reasoning with streaming attribute constraints, dynamic positional encoding, and denoising, outperforming existing methods by +3.4% mAP and +2.1% OLS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack consistent positional embedding and temporal attribute learning, hindering accurate road network reconstruction for autonomous driving.

Method: TopoStreamer introduces streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising.

Result: Achieves +3.4% mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception on OpenLane-V2.

Conclusion: TopoStreamer enhances lane topology reasoning, benefiting autonomous driving maneuvers like turning and lane changing.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by
capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their
semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform
road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the
limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute
learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address
these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model
for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces
three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute
constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary
coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information
within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment
patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the
accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which
serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.
On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4%
mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UPRE, a framework for zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) that jointly optimizes prompts and visual representations to address misalignment between detection tasks and Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSDA methods using VLMs overlook misalignment between detection tasks and VLMs, relying on manual prompts. UPRE aims to overcome this by enhancing both textual prompts and visual representations.

Method: UPRE introduces a multi-view domain prompt combining linguistic priors with detection knowledge, and a visual enhancement module for domain style variations. Multi-level strategies align representations at image and instance levels.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show UPRE's superior performance in ZSDA detection.

Conclusion: UPRE effectively addresses ZSDA challenges by optimizing prompts and visual representations, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the
lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their
zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address
domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection
task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement
(UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual
representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain
prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific
knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain
style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies,
including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which
align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual
representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments
conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of
our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for personalized vision models by decoupling common and dataset-specific features, addressing vulnerabilities in existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for traditional DNNs are ineffective or risky for fine-tuned personalized models, necessitating a robust verification method.

Method: Uses shadow models to isolate common features, represents dataset-specific features via output differences, trains a meta-classifier, and verifies ownership via hypothesis testing.

Result: Effective in detecting various model stealing attacks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides a secure and robust solution for verifying ownership of personalized models.

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream
tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with
private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable
intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,
model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized
models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods
(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from
scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,
or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for
personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our
method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow
models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting
dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the
victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.
After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by
determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of
the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by
hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training strategy to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for multi-image grounding tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex multi-image compositions and multimodal instructions, highlighting limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization.

Method: The approach involves synthesizing chain-of-thought data for cold-start initialization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA, and rule-based RL for optimal reasoning paths.

Result: The method improves performance by +9.04% on MIG-Bench and +4.98% on out-of-domain benchmarks, with additional gains in multi-image perception.

Conclusion: The RL-based post-training strategy effectively enhances MLLMs for multi-image grounding, demonstrating strong generalization and reasoning improvements.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding
in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance
degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image
compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in
cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt
a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the
reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach
begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for
cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to
identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using
the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL
to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\%
improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain
reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach
exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\%
and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks,
respectively.

TL;DR: Proposes a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) to improve human action segmentation by integrating low-frame-rate visual data with high-frame-rate motion data, reducing over-segmentation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent robots, but noise in pose estimation and object detection causes over-segmentation errors.

Method: Uses MMGCN with sinusoidal encoding for 3D skeletons, temporal graph fusion for multi-modal alignment, and SmoothLabelMix for data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

Conclusion: The MMGCN framework effectively mitigates fragmentation and improves action segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent
robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity
labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise
in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to
over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To
address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that
integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,
30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.
Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding
strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to
enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion
module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via
hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions
inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation
technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training
examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in
predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.
  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for
human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation
accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

Motivation: Existing methods are either task-specific or rely on paired datasets, limiting generalizability and suffering from closed-set constraints.

Method: Utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model with multimodal understanding for semantic priors, a lightweight module for alignment, and recurrent refinement for posterior sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments, showing effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is a promising solution for unified image restoration without dataset dependency.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level
vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,
limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on
training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.
To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach
through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion
model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide
sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition.
Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with
the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent
refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and
robustness. Our code and data will be available at

### [154] [Language-Unlocked ViT (LUViT): Empowering Self-Supervised Vision Transformers with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00754)
*Selim Kuzucu, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Anna Kukleva, Federico Tombari, Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUViT bridges the modality gap between LLMs and ViTs via joint pre-training with MAE and LoRA, enhancing vision task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch between text-centric LLMs and vision-centric ViTs limits their combined potential, leading to unstable finetuning.

Method: LUViT uses MAE to pre-train ViT and LoRA layers in the LLM block, jointly optimizing for alignment.

Result: LUViT improves performance on downstream vision tasks, effectively leveraging LLM knowledge.

Conclusion: LUViT offers a synergistic approach to integrate LLMs and ViTs for better visual understanding.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision
Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging
the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a
fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between
text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct
fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from
unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the
vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce
Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges
this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT
co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked
Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and
(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM
block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to
produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual
information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT
significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks,
showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for
visual understanding.

*Hao Xing, Kai Zhe Boey, Gordon Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of open-world human-object interaction segmentation, proposing a framework with innovations like EPGCN, Mixup-based training, and Temporal Clustering loss, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge, requiring models to handle out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation.

Method: Proposes a structured framework with EPGCN for feature upsampling, Mixup-based training for synthetic data, and Temporal Clustering loss for action grouping.

Result: Achieves 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation and out-of-distribution detection on Bimanual Actions and H2O datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses open-world action segmentation, with ablation studies confirming the impact of each component.

Abstract: Human-object interaction segmentation is a fundamental task of daily activity
understanding, which plays a crucial role in applications such as assistive
robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Most existing learning-based
methods excel in closed-world action segmentation, they struggle to generalize
to open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge. Collecting exhaustive
action categories for training is impractical due to the dynamic diversity of
human activities, necessitating models that detect and segment
out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation. To address this issue,
we formally define the open-world action segmentation problem and propose a
structured framework for detecting and segmenting unseen actions. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: 1) an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional
Network (EPGCN) with a novel decoder module for robust spatiotemporal feature
upsampling. 2) Mixup-based training to synthesize out-of-distribution data,
eliminating reliance on manual annotations. 3) A novel Temporal Clustering loss
that groups in-distribution actions while distancing out-of-distribution
samples.
  We evaluate our framework on two challenging human-object interaction
recognition datasets: Bimanual Actions and 2 Hands and Object (H2O) datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
action segmentation models across multiple open-set evaluation metrics,
achieving 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation (F1@50) and
out-of-distribution detection performances (AUROC), respectively. Additionally,
we conduct an in-depth ablation study to assess the impact of each proposed
component, identifying the optimal framework configuration for open-world
action segmentation.

*Jiaming Zhang, Rui Hu, Qing Guo, Wei Yang Bryan Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVALRY-V is a novel adversarial attack framework targeting V-MLLMs, improving attack performance by 22.8% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing methods lack efficiency and effectiveness due to cross-modal and temporal challenges.

Method: Introduces a dual-objective loss function and a two-stage generator framework for efficient adversarial attacks.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 22.8% on video benchmarks and shows 34.4% improvement on image tasks.

Conclusion: CAVALRY-V is a flexible and effective approach for adversarial research in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique
challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies,
and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal
Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that
directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language
generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the
model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine
cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage
generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model
transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence.
Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks
demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods,
achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both
commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5,
InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves
flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit
regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image
understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's
potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal
systems.

*Ziji Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OptiPrune combines noise optimization and token pruning to improve semantic alignment in text-to-image diffusion models while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either increase computational overhead or reduce semantic fidelity, creating a need for a balanced solution.

Method: OptiPrune uses distribution-aware noise optimization and similarity-based token pruning to enhance alignment and efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with reduced computational cost on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: OptiPrune effectively balances semantic alignment and efficiency in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often struggle to achieve accurate semantic
alignment between generated images and text prompts while maintaining
efficiency for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Existing approaches
either incur substantial computational overhead through noise optimization or
compromise semantic fidelity by aggressively pruning tokens. In this work, we
propose OptiPrune, a unified framework that combines distribution-aware initial
noise optimization with similarity-based token pruning to address both
challenges simultaneously. Specifically, (1) we introduce a distribution-aware
noise optimization module guided by attention scores to steer the initial
latent noise toward semantically meaningful regions, mitigating issues such as
subject neglect and feature entanglement; (2) we design a hardware-efficient
token pruning strategy that selects representative base tokens via patch-wise
similarity, injects randomness to enhance generalization, and recovers pruned
tokens using maximum similarity copying before attention operations. Our method
preserves the Gaussian prior during noise optimization and enables efficient
inference without sacrificing alignment quality. Experiments on benchmark
datasets, including Animal-Animal, demonstrate that OptiPrune achieves
state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with significantly reduced
computational cost.

Result: Achieves real-time performance with rapid convergence, minimal overhead, and higher success rates compared to CCD, FABRIK, and IPOPT.

Conclusion: The solver is effective for realistic human motion modeling, outperforming existing methods in real-time scenarios.

Abstract: Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of
high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive
virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel
real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic
human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and
just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles
complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating
forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method
effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and
complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for
realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on
the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used
iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK,
and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both
simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with
realistic joint limits. Results indicate that our IK solver achieves real-time
performance, exhibiting rapid convergence, minimal computational overhead per
iteration, and improved success rates compared to existing methods. The project

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for generating 3D medical images using a 2D diffusion approach, addressing anatomical fidelity and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D medical image generation methods lack anatomical fidelity, axial length flexibility, and are computationally expensive, limiting accessibility in resource-limited regions.

Method: TRACE uses a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach, modeling slices as video frames with segmentation priors, radiology reports, and optical flow for alignment and coherence.

Result: TRACE generates spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volumes efficiently, balancing computational cost with fidelity.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a practical solution for 3D medical image generation, suitable for clinical practice and resource-limited settings.

Abstract: 3D medical image generation is essential for data augmentation and patient
privacy, calling for reliable and efficient models suited for clinical
practice. However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity,
restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them
beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We
introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with
spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach.
TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation
priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical
flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame
strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into
a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with
preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency. Code is

TL;DR: A CNN-based method using synthetic particle images for real-time PSD measurement, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PSD measurement is crucial in industries like mining and pharmaceuticals, but traditional methods are manual and slow.

Method: Uses synthetic particle images generated with Blender to train CNNs (ResNet-50, InceptionV3, EfficientNet-B0) for PSD estimation.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 showed the best computational efficiency with comparable accuracy, suitable for real-time industrial use.

Conclusion: Synthetic data enables robust CNN training, offering potential for automated industrial PSD monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate particle size distribution (PSD) measurement is important in
industries such as mining, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizer manufacturing,
significantly influencing product quality and operational efficiency.
Traditional PSD methods like sieve analysis and laser diffraction are manual,
time-consuming, and limited by particle overlap. Recent developments in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable automated, real-time PSD estimation
directly from particle images. In this work, we present a CNN-based methodology
trained on realistic synthetic particle imagery generated using Blender's
advanced rendering capabilities. Synthetic data sets using this method can
replicate various industrial scenarios by systematically varying particle
shapes, textures, lighting, and spatial arrangements that closely resemble the
actual configurations. We evaluated three CNN-based architectures, ResNet-50,
InceptionV3, and EfficientNet-B0, for predicting critical PSD parameters (d10,
d50, d90). Results demonstrated comparable accuracy across models, with
EfficientNet-B0 achieving the best computational efficiency suitable for
real-time industrial deployment. This approach shows the effectiveness of
realistic synthetic data for robust CNN training, which offers significant
potential for automated industrial PSD monitoring. The code is released at :

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HEGS-DETR is an enhanced Detection Transformer framework for UAV-based object detection, addressing challenges like small targets and cluttered backgrounds with novel components like HFESNet, ESOP, SQR, and GAPE, achieving improved performance on the VisDrone dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV-OD algorithms struggle with small targets, high-density distributions, and cluttered backgrounds due to reliance on hand-crafted components and lack of aerial-specific optimizations.

Method: Proposes HEGS-DETR with HFESNet for high-frequency detail preservation, ESOP for small object detection, and SQR and GAPE for decoder stability and localization accuracy.

Result: Achieves a 5.1% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8% AP increase over baseline on VisDrone, with real-time speed and reduced parameters.

Conclusion: HEGS-DETR effectively addresses UAV-OD challenges, outperforming existing methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial
challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and
cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on
hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit
limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is
threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic
architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics,
resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks
have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address
these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time
Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the
High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone.
HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust
semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and
occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object
Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with
minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection.
Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware
Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and
localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing
explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset
demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\% AP increase
over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter
count by 4M.

*Peter Pavlík, Marc Schleiss, Anna Bou Ezzeddine, Viera Rozinajová*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Echo Top Height (ETH) as an auxiliary input for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting, finding mixed results with improvements at low rain rates but inconsistencies at higher intensities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve short-term rainfall prediction by incorporating vertical radar information (ETH) alongside traditional 2D reflectivity data.

Method: Implemented a 3D U-Net to process radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels, analyzing their relationship and impact on nowcasting.

Result: ETH improved skill at low rain rates but led to underestimation and inconsistency at higher intensities, with case studies showing varied effects.

Conclusion: While ETH shows potential, its inconsistent performance highlights the need for further research on integrating additional variables into nowcasting models.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using
recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as
transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep
learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most
approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable
vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we
explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the
maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary
input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship
between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting
rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the
radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are
able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are
inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically
underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to
illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and
increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for
critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to
nowcasting performance.

TL;DR: UAVD-Mamba, a multimodal UAV object detection framework, improves detection by using deformable tokens, multimodal feature fusion, and multiscale processing, outperforming baseline methods by 3.6% mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like occlusions, small object sizes, and irregular shapes in UAV object detection necessitate a robust multimodal method.

Method: Proposes UAVD-Mamba with Deformable Token Mamba Blocks (DTMBs) for RGB and IR modalities, multiscale feature stacking, and a Detection Neck for Mamba (DNM) inspired by YOLO.

Result: Outperforms baseline OAFA by 3.6% mAP on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Conclusion: UAVD-Mamba effectively addresses UAV object detection challenges through innovative multimodal and multiscale feature handling.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) object detection has been widely used in
traffic management, agriculture, emergency rescue, etc. However, it faces
significant challenges, including occlusions, small object sizes, and irregular
shapes. These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient
multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable
potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a
multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To
improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block
(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from
deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,
which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal
feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared
(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba
Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature
fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for
small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale
feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba
(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to
the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In
particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and
cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more
discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show
that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.
Codes will be released at https://github.com/GreatPlum-hnu/UAVD-Mamba.git.

improvement in manufacturing flexibility. The approach is validated through
extensive testing under four distinct lighting scenarios, showing practical
applicability for real-world industrial deployment.

TL;DR: Single-image NeRF training for surgical settings using preoperative MRI and neural style transfer, achieving high reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF's reliance on extensive multi-view data is impractical in surgical intraoperative settings due to time constraints. This work aims to enable NeRF training with limited intraoperative data.

Method: Leverage preoperative MRI for camera viewpoints, transfer intraoperative image appearance via neural style transfer (WTC2 and STROTSS) to create a training dataset for single-image NeRF.

Result: Evaluated on four neurosurgical cases, showing high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment compared to ground truth and multi-view NeRF.

Conclusion: Feasibility of single-image NeRF training in surgery is demonstrated, overcoming multi-view data limitations.

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incomplete multi-view camera data, necessitating a robust solution for accurate HD map construction.

Method: SafeMap integrates Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) and Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Correction (D-BEVC) to dynamically prioritize informative regions and correct BEV representations.

Result: SafeMap outperforms previous methods in both complete and incomplete scenarios, demonstrating superior performance and reliability.

Conclusion: SafeMap provides a plug-and-play solution for robust HD map generation, enhancing accuracy even with missing camera views.

Abstract: Robust high-definition (HD) map construction is vital for autonomous driving,
yet existing methods often struggle with incomplete multi-view camera data.
This paper presents SafeMap, a novel framework specifically designed to secure
accuracy even when certain camera views are missing. SafeMap integrates two key
components: the Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) module
and the Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Correction (D-BEVC) module.
G-PVR leverages prior knowledge of view importance to dynamically prioritize
the most informative regions based on the relationships among available camera
views. Furthermore, D-BEVC utilizes panoramic BEV features to correct the BEV
representations derived from incomplete observations. Together, these
components facilitate the end-to-end map reconstruction and robust HD map
generation. SafeMap is easy to implement and integrates seamlessly into
existing systems, offering a plug-and-play solution for enhanced robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that SafeMap significantly outperforms
previous methods in both complete and incomplete scenarios, highlighting its

Motivation: To enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during test time without re-training, particularly for complex, compositional tasks.

Method: Examines visual in-context learning architectures, introduces a synthetic compositional task generation engine, and investigates masking-based training objectives.

Result: Provides insights for multi-modal medical task sequences and identifies challenges in training models for complex tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a flexible way to define vision pipelines at test time but highlights unresolved challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of visual in-context learning to
enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during
test time without re-training. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on
training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than
individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple
intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision
pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the
properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a
particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for
training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation
engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation
datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional
tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives
to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex,
compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights
especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights
challenges that need to be addressed.

Motivation: Current 3D VLMs rely heavily on object detectors, causing bottlenecks and limited taxonomic flexibility.

Method: Proposes a scene-centric 3D VLM with language- and task-aware representations, embedding linguistic features into Gaussian primitives and using a dual sparsifier for compact tokens.

Result: Achieves five-fold performance improvement over prior 3D VLMs in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong generalization and advances 3D scene understanding by leveraging photorealistic representations.

Abstract: As multimodal language models advance, their application to 3D scene
understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object
detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic
flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM
for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene
representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the
3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive,
achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense
representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into
compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways,
producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present
the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D
representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong
generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in
out-of-the-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image2GS improves 3D scene reconstruction from a single image by focusing on visible regions using masked training, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by separating the lifting (visible regions) and completion (unseen regions) tasks.

Method: Uses visibility masks from optimized 3D Gaussian splats to train discriminative models only on visible regions, improving reconstruction quality.

Result: Outperforms baselines in visible regions and remains competitive with state-of-the-art models trained on full images.

Conclusion: Specializing in image-to-3D lifting with masked training yields better results, highlighting the difficulty of fitting unseen regions.

Abstract: We present Image2GS, a novel approach that addresses the challenging problem
of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by focusing
specifically on the image-to-3D lifting component of the reconstruction
process. By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model
representing what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating
content not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable
for discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from
optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view
during training. This masked training strategy significantly improves
reconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines.
Notably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains
competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target
images when evaluated on complete scenes. Our findings highlight the
fundamental struggle discriminative models face when fitting unseen regions and
demonstrate the advantages of addressing image-to-3D lifting as a distinct
problem with specialized techniques.

TL;DR: RTMap enhances single-traversal HD mapping by crowdsourcing a multi-traversal map, addressing uncertainty, localization, and real-time updates for improved accuracy and freshness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online HD mapping methods suffer from perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion, and lack of multi-agent fusion, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RTMap uses uncertainty-aware modeling, probabilistic localization, and real-time detection to crowdsource and update HD maps.

Result: Experiments show improved map quality and localization accuracy, benefiting downstream tasks like prediction and planning.

Conclusion: RTMap effectively improves HD map accuracy and freshness while supporting robust autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and
solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion
in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose
RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a
multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap
simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1)
Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2)
probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3)
real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on
several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on
both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating
our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning
modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the
crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap (Camera ready version

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDE, a new benchmark for evaluating robustness in monocular depth estimation, addressing gaps in standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks for monocular depth estimation focus on accuracy but lack robustness evaluation, prompting the need for a more comprehensive assessment tool.

Method: PDE uses procedural generation to create 3D scenes with controlled perturbations (e.g., object, camera, material, lighting changes) to test model robustness.

Result: The analysis identifies challenging perturbations for state-of-the-art depth models, providing insights for future research.

Conclusion: PDE offers a systematic way to evaluate robustness in depth estimation, with findings that can guide further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial progress on monocular depth
estimation, particularly as measured by the success of large models on standard
benchmarks. However, performance on standard benchmarks does not offer a
complete assessment, because most evaluate accuracy but not robustness. In this
work, we introduce PDE (Procedural Depth Evaluation), a new benchmark which
enables systematic robustness evaluation. PDE uses procedural generation to
create 3D scenes that test robustness to various controlled perturbations,
including object, camera, material and lighting changes. Our analysis yields
interesting findings on what perturbations are challenging for state-of-the-art
depth models, which we hope will inform further research. Code and data are

TL;DR: A novel segmentation-guided framework for text-to-image generation improves visual text rendering by using pixel-level text masks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate visual text rendering in text-to-image generation is hindered by issues like blurred glyphs and semantic drift, with existing methods being inflexible and complex.

Method: Proposes a framework with a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for text mask extraction and a streamlined diffusion model with adaptive glyph conditioning and region-specific loss.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on the AnyText benchmark and introduces new benchmarks (GlyphMM-benchmark and MiniText-benchmark) for rigorous evaluation.

Conclusion: The approach excels in small text rendering and complex layouts, demonstrating strong generalization and readiness for deployment.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet
accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs,
semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on
pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original
font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that
increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we
propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks
-- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional
inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual
segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined
diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a
region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark,
significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To
enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks:
GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex
typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in
small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at
small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong
generalization and deployment readiness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeEmbed is a self-supervised framework for learning invariant shape descriptors from 2D object contours, outperforming traditional and autoencoder-based methods in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shape quantification often requires invariance to geometric transformations (e.g., translation, scaling). Existing methods have limitations, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: ShapeEmbed uses a Euclidean distance matrix to encode object contours into invariant descriptors via self-supervised learning.

Result: The framework outperforms competitors in shape classification tasks on natural and biological images.

Conclusion: ShapeEmbed is a promising tool, especially for biological imaging, due to its robustness and superior performance.

Abstract: The shape of objects is an important source of visual information in a wide
range of applications. One of the core challenges of shape quantification is to
ensure that the extracted measurements remain invariant to transformations that
preserve an object's intrinsic geometry, such as changing its size,
orientation, and position in the image. In this work, we introduce ShapeEmbed,
a self-supervised representation learning framework designed to encode the
contour of objects in 2D images, represented as a Euclidean distance matrix,
into a shape descriptor that is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation,
reflection, and point indexing. Our approach overcomes the limitations of
traditional shape descriptors while improving upon existing state-of-the-art
autoencoder-based approaches. We demonstrate that the descriptors learned by
our framework outperform their competitors in shape classification tasks on
natural and biological images. We envision our approach to be of particular
relevance to biological imaging applications.

TL;DR: VisVM enhances vision-language models by guiding inference-time search for better visual comprehension, reducing hallucinations and improving detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of effective methods to scale inference-time computation for improving response quality in VLMs.

Method: Introduces Vision Value Model (VisVM) to evaluate and anticipate sentence quality during inference, providing long-term value.

Result: VisVM significantly improves caption quality with richer details and fewer hallucinations, and boosts VLM performance via self-training.

Conclusion: VisVM shows potential for self-improving VLMs, with code and model available for further development.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), there
lacks effective approaches to enhance response quality by scaling
inference-time computation. This capability is known to be a core step towards
the self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this
paper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time
search to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically,
VisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search
step, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result
from the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM
steers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or
insufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental
results demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs'
ability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer
hallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other
visual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with
the VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of
multimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving
VLMs. Our value model and code are available at

TL;DR: DAM-VSR is a framework for video super-resolution (VSR) that disentangles appearance enhancement and motion control, leveraging video diffusion and image super-resolution models for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating temporally consistent frames in VSR due to complex degradations and the limitations of existing methods.

Method: Proposes DAM-VSR, which separates VSR into appearance enhancement (using reference image super-resolution) and motion control (using video ControlNet), with a motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world and AIGC data, demonstrating strong detail generation capabilities.

Conclusion: DAM-VSR effectively combines generative priors and super-resolution models to enhance VSR performance, particularly in handling longer videos.

Abstract: Real-world video super-resolution (VSR) presents significant challenges due
to complex and unpredictable degradations. Although some recent methods utilize
image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation
capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We
attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address
this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of
SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos.
To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion
disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into
appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance
enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion
control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully
leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail
generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped
with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can
conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art
performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail
generation capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with outdated training data, limiting their ability to process current visual information. LiveVQA addresses this by providing a dataset for evaluating and updating MLLMs with live visual knowledge.

Method: The study benchmarks 17 MLLMs using LiveVQA, explores tool-use frameworks for visual seeking, and investigates PEFT methods for updating models with new visual knowledge.

Result: Tool-use frameworks improve performance by 327% on content beyond knowledge cutoff. PEFT methods are explored for efficient model updates.

Conclusion: LiveVQA highlights the need for updating MLLMs with live visual knowledge and demonstrates effective methods for improvement, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: The visual world around us constantly evolves, from real-time news and social
media trends to global infrastructure changes visible through satellite imagery
and augmented reality enhancements. However, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), which automate many tasks, struggle to stay current, limited by the
cutoff dates in their fixed training datasets. To quantify this stagnation, we
introduce LiveVQA, the first-of-its-kind dataset featuring 107,143 samples and
12 categories data specifically designed to support research in both seeking
and updating with live visual knowledge. Drawing from recent news articles,
video platforms, and academic publications in April 2024-May 2025, LiveVQA
enables evaluation of how models handle latest visual information beyond their
knowledge boundaries and how current methods help to update them. Our
comprehensive benchmarking of 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant
performance gaps on content beyond knowledge cutoff, and tool-use or agentic
visual seeking framework drastically gain an average of 327% improvement.
Furthermore, we explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to
update MLLMs with new visual knowledge. We dive deeply to the critical balance
between adapter capacity and model capability when updating MLLMs with new
visual knowledge. All the experimental dataset and source code are publicly

Motivation: Existing multi-modal models struggle with complex radiology reports and lack interpretability.

Method: RadZero uses VL-CABS for alignment, multi-positive contrastive training, and a pre-trained vision encoder with Transformer layers.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation on chest radiograph benchmarks.

Conclusion: RadZero enhances VL alignment in radiology with zero-shot capability and improved explainability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal models have significantly improved
vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches
struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and
offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To
address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel framework for VL
alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of
our approach is VL-CABS (Vision-Language Cross-Attention Based on Similarity),
which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable,
fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract
concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive
contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and
multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder
with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient
high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text
embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference
with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity
maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest
radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL
similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving
explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation
demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation,
further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

Motivation: To explore and improve reasoning strategies (CoT and RL) in visual generation, an underexplored area.

Method: Introduces BiCoT-GRPO with two CoT levels (semantic for prompt planning, token for pixel processing) and ensemble rewards for joint optimization.

Result: 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench, 19% on WISE, surpassing FLUX.

Conclusion: T2I-R1 demonstrates the effectiveness of bi-level CoT and RL in enhancing text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

TL;DR: A framework (FDiff) for disentangling features in Diffusion Models is proposed, along with two sampling methods to enhance realism and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving controllability and disentanglement in Diffusion Models, which are underexplored areas.

Method: Training Diffusion Models with spatial content masks and style embeddings, and proposing two sampling methods: generalized GCDM and timestep-dependent weight scheduling.

Result: Enhanced realism and controllability in image manipulation and translation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FDiff framework and sampling methods effectively improve disentanglement and controllability in Diffusion Models.

Abstract: As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have
been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to
train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to
naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process
have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for
feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two
sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also
enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned
on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style
embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion
Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and
semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling
methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the
conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between
conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in
our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for
content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe
better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in
image manipulation and image translation.

Motivation: Existing RSI editing methods lack diversity in datasets and suffer from incorrect semantics due to text-image mismatches, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: A multi-scale training approach with RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) is introduced, requiring only a single image for training.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques in CLIP scores and subjective evaluations, and demonstrates practicality in disaster assessment tasks.

area of remote sensing image (RSI) editing has not received sufficient
attention. Deep learning based editing methods generally involve two sequential
stages: generation and editing. For natural images, these stages primarily rely
on generative backbones pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets and text
guidance facilitated by vision-language models (VLMs). However, it become less
viable for RSIs: First, existing generative RSI benchmark datasets do not fully
capture the diversity of RSIs, and is often inadequate for universal editing
tasks. Second, the single text semantic corresponds to multiple image
semantics, leading to the introduction of incorrect semantics. To solve above
problems, this paper proposes a text-guided RSI editing method and can be
trained using only a single image. A multi-scale training approach is adopted
to preserve consistency without the need for training on extensive benchmarks,
while leveraging RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) to ensure
accuracy and controllability. Experimental results on multiple RSI editing
tasks show that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both CLIP
scores and subjective evaluations compared to existing methods. Additionally,
we explore the ability of the edited RSIs to support disaster assessment tasks
in order to validate their practicality. Codes will be released at

### [183] [Unsupervised contrastive analysis for anomaly detection in brain MRIs via conditional diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00772)
*Cristiano Patrício, Carlo Alberto Barbano, Attilio Fiandrotti, Riccardo Renzulli, Marco Grangetto, Luis F. Teixeira, João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised framework using a self-supervised contrastive encoder and diffusion model to improve brain MRI reconstruction for anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on target samples (unhealthy data), which are hard to obtain in clinical settings. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) avoids this but struggles with precise brain anatomy reconstruction.

Method: Trains a self-supervised contrastive encoder on healthy images to extract features, then conditions a diffusion model for reconstruction. Anomalies are localized via pixel-wise comparison.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art anomaly localization on the NOVA benchmark and demonstrates effectiveness on four brain MRI datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves reconstruction quality and anomaly detection without needing unhealthy samples, making it clinically viable.

Abstract: Contrastive Analysis (CA) detects anomalies by contrasting patterns unique to
a target group (e.g., unhealthy subjects) from those in a background group
(e.g., healthy subjects). In the context of brain MRIs, existing CA approaches
rely on supervised contrastive learning or variational autoencoders (VAEs)
using both healthy and unhealthy data, but such reliance on target samples is
challenging in clinical settings. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) offers
an alternative by learning a reference representation of healthy anatomy
without the need for target samples. Deviations from this reference
distribution can indicate potential anomalies. In this context, diffusion
models have been increasingly adopted in UAD due to their superior performance
in image generation compared to VAEs. Nonetheless, precisely reconstructing the
anatomy of the brain remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised framework to improve the reconstruction quality by training a
self-supervised contrastive encoder on healthy images to extract meaningful
anatomical features. These features are used to condition a diffusion model to
reconstruct the healthy appearance of a given image, enabling interpretable
anomaly localization via pixel-wise comparison. We validate our approach
through a proof-of-concept on a facial image dataset and further demonstrate
its effectiveness on four brain MRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art
anomaly localization performance on the NOVA benchmark.

TL;DR: Training autoregressive video diffusion models from a single video stream is effective and comparable to offline training, with experience replay methods retaining only a subset of the stream.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of training video diffusion models from a single video stream, resembling embodied agents' experience.

Method: Uses autoregressive video diffusion models and experience replay methods, retaining a subset of the preceding video stream. Introduces four new datasets for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates that training from a single video stream is as effective as offline training with the same gradient steps.

Conclusion: The approach is viable and efficient, supported by new datasets for streaming lifelong generative video modeling.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that training autoregressive video diffusion models
from a single video stream$\unicode{x2013}$resembling the experience of
embodied agents$\unicode{x2013}$is not only possible, but can also be as
effective as standard offline training given the same number of gradient steps.
Our work further reveals that this main result can be achieved using experience
replay methods that only retain a subset of the preceding video stream. To
support training and evaluation in this setting, we introduce four new datasets
for streaming lifelong generative video modeling: Lifelong Bouncing Balls,
Lifelong 3D Maze, Lifelong Drive, and Lifelong PLAICraft, each consisting of
one million consecutive frames from environments of increasing complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPFormer improves RGB-D scene understanding by addressing depth map spatial properties, enhancing attention representation, and achieving state-of-the-art results in road detection and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies overlook intrinsic spatial properties of depth maps, causing attention shift issues and prediction errors.

Method: Proposes DiPFormer with Depth SAO for spatial relationships, Depth LCA for feature similarity, and an MLP Decoder for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Significant improvements in road detection (+7.5%) and semantic segmentation (+4.9% / +1.5%), with top performance on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets.

Conclusion: DiPFormer effectively addresses attention misalignment and sets new benchmarks for RGB-D scene understanding.

Abstract: RGB-D has gradually become a crucial data source for understanding complex
scenes in assisted driving. However, existing studies have paid insufficient
attention to the intrinsic spatial properties of depth maps. This oversight
significantly impacts the attention representation, leading to prediction
errors caused by attention shift issues. To this end, we propose a novel
learnable Depth interaction Pyramid Transformer (DiPFormer) to explore the
effectiveness of depth. Firstly, we introduce Depth Spatial-Aware Optimization
(Depth SAO) as offset to represent real-world spatial relationships. Secondly,
the similarity in the feature space of RGB-D is learned by Depth Linear
Cross-Attention (Depth LCA) to clarify spatial differences at the pixel level.
Finally, an MLP Decoder is utilized to effectively fuse multi-scale features
for meeting real-time requirements. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed DiPFormer significantly addresses the issue of attention
misalignment in both road detection (+7.5%) and semantic segmentation (+4.9% /
+1.5%) tasks. DiPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI
(97.57% F-score on KITTI road and 68.74% mIoU on KITTI-360) and Cityscapes
(83.4% mIoU) datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSPO combines SFT and RL advantages, using RCR and SSR to improve generalization and stability, outperforming existing methods in text-to-image and text-to-video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of SFT (limited generalization) and RL (dependency on preference data/reward models, risk of reward exploitation) by combining their strengths.

Method: Proposes SSPO with RCR (uses historical checkpoints for paired data) and SSR (dynamically evaluates sample quality, switches between DPO and SFT).

Result: Outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks and shows strong performance in text-to-video tasks.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively balances stability and generalization, proving superior in multimodal generation tasks.

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable
during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter,
despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference
data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to
preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for
paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and
the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling
Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a
Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to
construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting.
Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to
dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated
samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically
switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the
training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental
results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on
text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in
text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and
text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the
text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the
text-to-video benchmarks.

TL;DR: DynaCLR is a self-supervised method for embedding cell and organelle dynamics using contrastive learning on time-lapse images.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a flexible, self-supervised method for analyzing dynamic cellular responses to perturbations, reducing reliance on extensive human annotations.

Method: DynaCLR combines single-cell tracking and time-aware contrastive sampling to learn temporally regularized representations of cell dynamics.

Result: The method generalizes effectively to in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, enabling tasks like cell state classification, clustering migration patterns, and cross-modal distillation.

Conclusion: DynaCLR is a versatile tool for comparative analyses of cellular dynamics, with applications in pharmacological, microbial, and genetic studies, supported by open-source implementations.

Abstract: We report DynaCLR, a self-supervised method for embedding cell and organelle
Dynamics via Contrastive Learning of Representations of time-lapse images.
DynaCLR integrates single-cell tracking and time-aware contrastive sampling to
learn robust, temporally regularized representations of cell dynamics. DynaCLR
embeddings generalize effectively to in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets, and can be used for several downstream tasks with sparse human
annotations. We demonstrate efficient annotations of cell states with a
human-in-the-loop using fluorescence and label-free imaging channels. DynaCLR
method enables diverse downstream biological analyses: classification of cell
division and infection, clustering heterogeneous cell migration patterns,
cross-modal distillation of cell states from fluorescence to label-free
channel, alignment of asynchronous cellular responses and broken cell tracks,
and discovering organelle response due to infection. DynaCLR is a flexible
method for comparative analyses of dynamic cellular responses to

*Chenglin Li, Qianglong Chen, Zhi Li, Feng Tao, Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoCogQA is a synthetic benchmark to evaluate cognitive abilities of LVLMs, revealing limitations in abstract and symbolic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack control and diagnostic power for evaluating high-level cognitive abilities in LVLMs.

Method: Proposed VideoCogQA, a scalable benchmark using synthetic videos with fine-grained control over content and difficulty.

Result: SOTA models like GPT-4o score 48.8% on abstract tasks, with performance dropping 15% as complexity increases.

Conclusion: Current LVLMs struggle with abstract cognition; VideoCogQA highlights gaps and future improvement directions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) have led to
promising results in multimodal video understanding. However, it remains
unclear whether these models possess the cognitive capabilities required for
high-level tasks, particularly those involving symbolic and abstract
perception. Existing benchmarks typically rely on real-world, annotated videos,
which lack control over video content and inherent difficulty, limiting their
diagnostic power. To bridge this gap, we propose VideoCogQA, a scalable and
fully controllable benchmark inspired by game-world environments, designed to
evaluate the cognitive abilities of LVLMs. By generating synthetic videos via a
programmatic engine, VideoCogQA allows fine-grained control over visual
elements, temporal dynamics, and task difficulty. This approach enables a
focused evaluation of video cognitive abilities, independent of prior knowledge
from visual scene semantics. The dataset includes 800 videos and 3,280
question-answer pairs, featuring tasks related to abstract concepts, symbolic
elements, and multimodal integration, with varying levels of difficulty.
Experimental results show that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as
GPT-4o, achieve an average performance of 48.8% on tasks involving abstract
concepts. Additionally, performance drops by 15% as task complexity increases,
highlighting the challenges LVLMs face in maintaining consistent performance.
Through this work, we hope to show the limitations of current LVLMs and offer
insights into how they can more effectively emulate human cognitive processes
in the future.

*Pengkun Jiao, Bin Zhu, Jingjing Chen, Chong-Wah Ngo, Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVIT introduces Dual-LoRA and VCE to efficiently adapt MLLMs for diverse tasks, addressing data conflicts with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve data conflicts in EVIT as task diversity grows, enhancing adapter capacity.

Method: Dual-LoRA (holistic-to-local framework with skill and task spaces) and VCE (multi-level feature aggregation).

Result: Memory- and time-efficient, outperforming standard LoRA and LoRA-MoE in inference time.

Conclusion: Dual-LoRA and VCE effectively enhance MLLM adaptation, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Efficient Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning (EVIT) seeks to adapt Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to downstream tasks with minimal computational
overhead. However, as task diversity and complexity increase, EVIT faces
significant challenges in resolving data conflicts. To address this limitation,
we propose the Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (Dual-LoRA), a holistic-to-local
framework that enhances the adapter's capacity to address data conflict through
dual structural optimization. Specifically, we utilize two subspaces: a skill
space for stable, holistic knowledge retention, and a rank-rectified task space
that locally activates the holistic knowledge. Additionally, we introduce
Visual Cue Enhancement (VCE), a multi-level local feature aggregation module
designed to enrich the vision-language projection with local details. Our
approach is both memory- and time-efficient, requiring only 1.16$\times$ the
inference time of the standard LoRA method (with injection into the query and
value projection layers), and just 73\% of the inference time of a 4-expert
LoRA-MoE. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and general MLLM
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

*Ziqi Wang, Chang Che, Qi Wang, Yangyang Li, Zenglin Shi, Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMoLoRA, a framework for continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) to address dual catastrophic forgetting in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), improving performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior CVIT efforts overlook unique challenges like dual forgetting (visual understanding and instruction following). The goal is to enhance MLLMs' adaptability to new tasks without losing prior capabilities.

Method: Proposes SMoLoRA, a dual-routing framework with separate modules for visual understanding and instruction following, using low-rank adaptation to prevent forgetting. Introduces a new CVIT benchmark for evaluation.

Result: SMoLoRA outperforms existing methods in mitigating forgetting, generalizing to unseen tasks, and handling diverse instructions.

Conclusion: SMoLoRA effectively addresses dual forgetting in CVIT, offering a robust solution for evolving MLLM functionalities.

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) enables multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to effectively handle a wide range of vision tasks by framing them as
language-based instructions. Building on this, continual visual instruction
tuning (CVIT) extends the capability of MLLMs to incrementally learn new tasks,
accommodating evolving functionalities. While prior work has advanced CVIT
through the development of new benchmarks and approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, these efforts largely follow traditional continual
learning paradigms, neglecting the unique challenges specific to CVIT. We
identify a dual form of catastrophic forgetting in CVIT, where MLLMs not only
forget previously learned visual understanding but also experience a decline in
instruction following abilities as they acquire new tasks. To address this, we
introduce the Separable Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (SMoLoRA) framework,
which employs separable routing through two distinct modules-one for visual
understanding and another for instruction following. This dual-routing design
enables specialized adaptation in both domains, preventing forgetting while
improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a new CVIT benchmark that goes
beyond existing benchmarks by additionally evaluating a model's ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and handle diverse instructions across various
tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMoLoRA outperforms existing
methods in mitigating dual forgetting, improving generalization to unseen
tasks, and ensuring robustness in following diverse instructions. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth completion methods struggle with generalization to new datasets or unseen sparse depth patterns, limiting real-world applications.

Method: OMNI-DC uses a Multi-resolution Depth Integrator for handling sparse inputs, a Laplacian loss for training ambiguity, and is trained on mixed datasets with scale normalization and synthetic depth patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 datasets show consistent improvements, reducing errors by up to 43%.

Conclusion: OMNI-DC demonstrates strong generalization and robustness, making it suitable for real-world depth completion tasks.

Abstract: Depth completion (DC) aims to predict a dense depth map from an RGB image and
a sparse depth map. Existing DC methods generalize poorly to new datasets or
unseen sparse depth patterns, limiting their real-world applications. We
propose OMNI-DC, a highly robust DC model that generalizes well zero-shot to
various datasets. The key design is a novel Multi-resolution Depth Integrator,
allowing our model to deal with very sparse depth inputs. We also introduce a
novel Laplacian loss to model the ambiguity in the training process. Moreover,
we train OMNI-DC on a mixture of high-quality datasets with a scale
normalization technique and synthetic depth patterns. Extensive experiments on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiMo-GUI is a training-free framework for GUI grounding that uses dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization to improve accuracy by focusing on textual and iconic elements separately and refining ambiguous predictions hierarchically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding natural language queries in GUIs is challenging due to visual diversity, spatial clutter, and language ambiguity. Existing methods often treat GUIs as monolithic images, limiting performance.

Method: DiMo-GUI splits GUIs into textual and iconic elements, processes each modality independently using vision-language models, and refines ambiguous predictions by dynamically focusing on candidate regions.

Result: The framework outperforms baseline methods on standard GUI grounding benchmarks, showing improved accuracy without additional training or annotations.

Conclusion: DiMo-GUI effectively combines modality separation and hierarchical refinement to address GUI grounding challenges, offering a practical and scalable solution.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

TL;DR: TalentMine is an LLM-enhanced framework that improves semantic understanding of tabular data in talent management, achieving 100% accuracy in query tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table extraction methods fail to preserve semantic relationships in tabular data, leading to poor performance in retrieval-augmented systems.

Method: TalentMine uses multimodal reasoning to create semantically enriched table representations, avoiding CSV or text linearization.

Result: TalentMine achieves 100% accuracy in query tasks, outperforming AWS Textract (0%) and AWS Textract Visual Q&A (40%).

Conclusion: TalentMine addresses semantic loss in table extraction, offering a robust solution for talent management systems.

Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex
tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

Motivation: To accelerate discovery and optimization in science and engineering by enabling geographically dispersed researchers to collaborate effectively using shared FAIR data and ML models.

Method: Implemented on nanoHUB services, the framework includes a shared database (ResultsDB), automated data processing (Sim2L), and active learning for sequential optimization.

Result: Researchers can submit data via a web interface, benefit from updated ML models, and collaboratively optimize tasks like food dye combinations.

Conclusion: The framework is broadly applicable and scalable to other optimization problems, promoting accessible and collaborative research.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in
self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate
discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When
supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data
infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more
effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on
nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this
framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent
optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central
database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine
learning models that automatically update as additional data become available.
New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically
processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes
all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate
nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where
researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are
trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future
experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task
seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired
target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and
students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and
explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential
optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in IMU-based HAR datasets and lack of transparency in existing zero-shot HAR models.

Method: Introduces SEZ-HARN, a model that recognizes untrained activities and explains decisions via skeleton videos. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets.

Result: SEZ-HARN matches black-box models' accuracy (within 3% on PAMAP2) while offering understandable explanations.

Conclusion: SEZ-HARN balances accuracy and transparency, advancing practical HAR applications.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted
living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited
by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of
activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR
(ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain
their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel
IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity
Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered
during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making
process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four
benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its
performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The
experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and
understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition
accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the
best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable
performance on the other three datasets.

*Shreyansh Padarha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvDistill improves knowledge distillation by using reward-guided dataset distillation, enhancing student model performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods limit student models by focusing on copying teacher responses, reducing generalizability and efficiency, especially in reasoning tasks.

Method: AdvDistill uses multiple teacher responses per prompt, assigns rewards via rule-based verifiers, and trains student models with weighted rewards.

Result: Significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation enhances efficacy and benefits for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has
benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These
techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

Result: VoyagerVision created 2.75 unique structures in 50 iterations and succeeded in 50% of flat-world building tests, outperforming Voyager.

Conclusion: Visual feedback enhances spatial interpretation and task performance, demonstrating the potential of multi-modal models in open-ended AGI.

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their
own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of
interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use
of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse
the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing
these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial
environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully
perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes
VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within
Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the
foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75
unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was
incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction.
Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in
half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex
structures. Project website is available at

*Basab Jha, Firoj Paudel, Ujjwal Puri, Zhang Yuting, Choi Donghyuk, Wang Junhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces inverse reasoning, a method for LLMs to decompose and explain their reasoning post-hoc, improving interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the blackbox nature of LLM decision-making by enabling self-reflection and explanation of reasoning chains.

Method: Uses a metacognitive structure (SAGE-nano) to reverse attention flow and generate explanations for reasoning choices.

Result: Achieves high reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score), comparable to top models.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning enhances LLM transparency and performance, advancing AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

*Vidhi Rathore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel pipeline using RL and decision trees extracts interpretable decision logic from legacy systems, tested on dummy systems with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy systems lack documentation, and traditional methods fail to capture underlying logic.

Method: Uses RL to explore input space, identify decision boundaries, clusters transitions, and trains decision trees for human-readable rules.

Result: RL agent focuses on boundary regions; extracted rules accurately reflect system logic.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective for generating specifications and test cases in legacy migration.

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often
hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's
intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely
replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This
paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision
logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify
critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes
in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the
output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are
then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate
the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the
pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,
including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.
Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant
boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of
the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating
specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

TL;DR: The study examines how ChatGPT affects students' cognitive engagement in academic writing, finding reduced engagement with AI assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs reducing deep thinking and active learning in education prompted this investigation.

Method: Experimental design with AI-assisted (ChatGPT) and control groups, using a cognitive engagement scale (CES-AI) to measure mental effort, attention, deep processing, and strategic thinking.

Result: ChatGPT group showed significantly lower cognitive engagement scores than the control group, indicating potential cognitive offloading.

Conclusion: AI tools like ChatGPT may hinder deep cognitive involvement; pedagogical strategies are needed to promote active engagement with AI-generated content.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education,
concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active
learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of
students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental
design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT)
or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured
argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the
CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and
strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive
engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These
findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study
contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications
of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such
tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote
active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising
self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

TL;DR: xHAIM enhances HAIM by adding explainability and task-specific data fusion, improving prediction accuracy (AUC from 79.9% to 90.3%) and clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of HAIM (task-agnostic data use, lack of explainability) to improve AI's clinical applicability.

Method: Four-step framework: identify task-relevant data, generate patient summaries, improve predictive modeling, and provide clinical explanations.

Result: xHAIM boosts AUC to 90.3% on chest pathology and operative tasks, outperforming HAIM (79.9%).

Conclusion: xHAIM transforms AI into an explainable decision support tool, bridging AI advancements with clinical needs.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in
medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework
that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM
uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these
limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework
leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through
four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data
across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using
these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical
explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.
Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%
to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM
transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support
system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant
patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for NP-hard routing problems are either computationally expensive (exact algorithms) or lack optimality guarantees (heuristics). ML offers potential improvements.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and improvement-based approaches, integrating OR and ML techniques.

Result: A structured framework for applying ML to routing problems, guiding future research and addressing emerging VRP variants.

Conclusion: ML can enhance traditional OR methods for routing problems, with the proposed taxonomy serving as a foundation for future advancements.

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML)
tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on
routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle
routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact
algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal
solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without
guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models,
there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to
enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a
taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and
improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various
problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods
with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide
future research and address emerging VRP variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTRO trains language models to reason like search algorithms using self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration, improving reasoning in non-reasoner models like Llama 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance reasoning capabilities of non-reasoner models by teaching structured search behavior derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Method: Uses synthetic datasets from MCTS, converts search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts, and applies RL with verifiable rewards.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains (16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, 20.0% on AIME 2024) on challenging problems.

Conclusion: Search-inspired training is effective for instilling robust reasoning in open LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

*Maggie Huan, Yuetai Li, Tuney Zheng, Xiaoyu Xu, Seungone Kim, Minxin Du, Radha Poovendran, Graham Neubig, Xiang Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Most math-performing LLMs fail to generalize gains to other domains; RL-tuned models outperform SFT-tuned ones in cross-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if improvements in math benchmarks reflect broader problem-solving ability or narrow overfitting.

Method: Evaluated 20+ reasoning-tuned models across diverse tasks and conducted controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models with different tuning methods.

Result: RL-tuned models generalize better, while SFT-tuned models lose general capabilities due to representation drift.

Conclusion: Suggests rethinking post-training methods, especially reliance on SFT-distilled data, to enhance reasoning models.

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-dimensional cell-jump move and an extended local search framework (2d-LS) for SMT-NRA, integrating MCSAT and sample-cell projection to enhance efficiency. A hybrid framework combining these methods shows improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance local search for SMT-NRA by improving efficiency and effectiveness through novel moves and integration of existing frameworks.

Method: Proposes a 2d-cell-jump move, extends the LS framework to 2d-LS, integrates MCSAT with sample-cell projection, and designs a hybrid framework combining MCSAT, 2d-LS, and OpenCAD.

Result: Experimental results show improved local search performance, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The introduced techniques and hybrid framework significantly enhance the efficiency of local search for SMT-NRA.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory
of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a
two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the
key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we
propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the
local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing
satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To
further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed
technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is
well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search
away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA
combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through
information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in
local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

*Dongyoon Hwang, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo, Dongmin Park, Jongho Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL for LLMs in chess shows promise with dense rewards but plateaus below expert levels due to pretrained model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if LLMs can develop strategic reasoning in chess using RL, leveraging dense rewards from a chess-pretrained network.

Method: Use a chess-pretrained action-value network for dense rewards (knowledge distillation) and compare with sparse binary rewards.

Result: Dense rewards outperform sparse ones, but models plateau below expert levels, likely due to pretrained model deficits.

Conclusion: RL alone may not fully overcome pretrained LLMs' chess understanding deficits; further research is needed.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown
promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL
remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic
reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a
chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's
output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our
experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform
sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below
expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and
find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained
models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be
able to fully overcome.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses security risks in multimodal foundation model-driven agents, proposing a risk discrimination mechanism and automated assessment to mitigate jailbreak vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal agents are increasingly used in sensitive scenarios but face jailbreak risks, where attackers bypass constraints to trigger unauthorized actions. Existing security measures lack effectiveness in complex interactions.

Method: The study constructs a risk discrimination mechanism using behavioral sequence information and designs an automated assessment scheme based on a large language model.

Result: Preliminary validation shows improved recognition of risky behaviors and reduced jailbreak probability in high-risk tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides insights for security risk modeling and protection in multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant
interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large
model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed
to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the
original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger
certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing
unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new
challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent
agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in
detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations
or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated
methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is
currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile
multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by
incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated
assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary
validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the
method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist
in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study
can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and
protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Motivation: To address the gap between current AI capabilities and AGI by synthesizing insights from AI, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology, and proposing pathways for more adaptive and domain-agnostic intelligence.

Method: Cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, analyzing architectural and cognitive foundations, and exploring frameworks like Agentic RAG, VLMs, and neurosymbolic systems.

Result: Identifies modular reasoning, memory integration, and multi-agent coordination as critical for AGI, along with the potential of Agentic RAG and VLMs for adaptive behavior.

Conclusion: True AGI requires integration of memory, reasoning, and modular components, with ongoing challenges in scientific, technical, and ethical domains.

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This
enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,
DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal
fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by
their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This
paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning
artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,
and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations
of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent
memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of
Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use
to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,
including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free
methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but
as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task
completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone
but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,
interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive
behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,
and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge
the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we
identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe and reliable behavior in LLM-powered agents to prevent unintended consequences.

Method: Three-step approach: initialize CID for task specifications, guide agent interactions using CID, and iteratively refine CID based on outcomes.

Result: Enhanced safety in code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Conclusion: CIP effectively improves agent safety by leveraging CIDs for structured decision-making.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

*Kefan Jin, Xingyao Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph relation learning method to detect ghost objects in self-driving scenarios and integrates it into an end-to-end navigation system for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental disturbances like sensor noise and adversarial perturbations cause false positives (ghost objects), which traditional navigation methods fail to handle safely.

Method: The approach learns spatio-temporal relations among vehicles to assess information reliability and integrates this into a navigation network.

Result: Simulations in CARLA show the method effectively handles ghost objects in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The work is the first to use graph relation learning for end-to-end robust navigation against ghost vehicles, improving safety and generalizability.

Abstract: Environmental disturbances, such as sensor data noises, various lighting
conditions, challenging weathers and external adversarial perturbations, are
inevitable in real self-driving applications. Existing researches and testings
have shown that they can severely influence the vehicles perception ability and
performance, one of the main issue is the false positive detection, i.e., the
ghost object which is not real existed or occurs in the wrong position (such as
a non-existent vehicle). Traditional navigation methods tend to avoid every
detected objects for safety, however, avoiding a ghost object may lead the
vehicle into a even more dangerous situation, such as a sudden break on the
highway. Considering the various disturbance types, it is difficult to address
this issue at the perceptual aspect. A potential solution is to detect the
ghost through relation learning among the whole scenario and develop an
integrated end-to-end navigation system. Our underlying logic is that the
behavior of all vehicles in the scene is influenced by their neighbors, and
normal vehicles behave in a logical way, while ghost vehicles do not. By
learning the spatio-temporal relation among surrounding vehicles, an
information reliability representation is learned for each detected vehicle and
then a robot navigation network is developed. In contrast to existing works, we
encourage the network to learn how to represent the reliability and how to
aggregate all the information with uncertainties by itself, thus increasing the
efficiency and generalizability. To the best of the authors knowledge, this
paper provides the first work on using graph relation learning to achieve
end-to-end robust navigation in the presence of ghost vehicles. Simulation
results in the CARLA platform demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
the proposed method in various scenarios.

### [212] [Flexora: Flexible Low Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10774)
*Chenxing Wei, Yao Shu, Ying Tiffany He, Fei Richard Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flexora, a method to improve LoRA by automatically selecting key layers for fine-tuning, enhancing performance on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face performance limitations in specific tasks due to knowledge boundaries. Fine-tuning methods like LoRA can overfit, reducing effectiveness.

Method: Flexora frames layer selection as a hyperparameter optimization problem, solved using unrolled differentiation, and selects optimal layers for fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show Flexora consistently outperforms baselines across pretrained models and tasks.

Conclusion: Flexora effectively addresses LoRA's overfitting, improving task performance, with theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial
intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has
significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in
practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually
hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning
techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have
been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would
underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these
tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we
propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and
flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve
the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora
firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled

improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our
Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and
many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.

### [213] [OM4OV: Leveraging Ontology Matching for Ontology Versioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20302)
*Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new ontology versioning (OV) approach using ontology matching (OM) techniques, introducing the OM4OV pipeline and a cross-reference mechanism to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic nature of the Semantic Web and growing ontology sizes overwhelm current OV methods, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: The paper introduces the OM4OV pipeline, reformulates OV tasks using OM techniques, and proposes a cross-reference mechanism for optimization.

Result: Experimental validation on OAEI datasets shows improved OV performance, with insights into false mappings in OV tasks.

Conclusion: The OM4OV pipeline and cross-reference mechanism effectively enhance OV, addressing scalability and manual error challenges.

Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary
to capture time-varying information, particularly for widely used ontologies.
Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial
component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and
accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In
this paper, we propose a fresh approach to performing OV using existing
ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV
pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation and
measurements for OV tasks. Building upon the prior alignment(s) from OM, we
propose a pipeline optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR)
mechanism to enhance overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the
OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in an OV testbed originating
from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also
discuss insights into OM used for OV tasks, where some apparent false mappings
detected by OV systems are not actually untrue.

*Fabrizio Marozzo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative method to refine ambiguous natural language prompts in generative AI, improving accuracy and user satisfaction over one-shot solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language ambiguity in generative AI leads to imprecise outputs, requiring users to manually iterate corrections.

Method: The approach uses structured clarification questions and alternative solutions, supported by input/output examples, to resolve ambiguities systematically.

Result: The method outperforms one-shot solutions in accuracy, resolution time, and user satisfaction across coding, data analysis, and creative writing tasks.

Conclusion: The iterative approach effectively reduces ambiguity in generative AI interactions, enhancing precision and user experience.

Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling
natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent
ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing
users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an
iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a
structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution
proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every
uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a
diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our
method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher
user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically
require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.

### [215] [Free and Fair Hardware: A Pathway to Copyright Infringement-Free Verilog Generation using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06096)
*Sam Bush, Matthew DeLorenzo, Phat Tieu, Jeyavijayan Rajendran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses copyright risks in LLM-generated Verilog codes by introducing FreeSet, an open-source dataset, and FreeV, a fine-tuned Llama model, reducing violation rates to 3% and improving Verilog generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hardware datasets for LLM fine-tuning are limited and pose copyright risks, prompting the need for a safer, open-source alternative.

Method: Proposes an evaluation benchmark for copyright risk, curates the FreeSet dataset, and fine-tunes the Llama model (FreeV) using continual pre-training.

Result: FreeV achieves a 3% copyright violation rate and improves VerilogEval pass@10 rates by over 10%.

Conclusion: The FreeSet dataset and FreeV model mitigate copyright risks while enhancing Verilog generation performance.

Abstract: Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design
tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various
fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source
repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain
minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright
violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to
estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected
codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset,
FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation
framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data.
We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual
pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our
results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of
copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate.
Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog
generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10
rates by over 10%.

*Guiyao Tie, Xueyang Zhou, Tianhe Gu, Ruihang Zhang, Chaoran Hu, Sizhe Zhang, Mengqu Sun, Yan Zhang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMMR, a benchmark to evaluate multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs, highlighting gaps in reasoning quality despite improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on reasoning quality in MLLMs, particularly those with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T).

Method: MMMR includes a high-difficulty dataset (1,083 questions) and a Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) to assess reasoning beyond accuracy.

Result: MLLMs-T outperform non-thinking models but exhibit reasoning flaws like inconsistency. Top models (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet) still struggle with reasoning quality.

Conclusion: MMMR provides a scalable tool for evaluating and improving multi-modal reasoning, revealing gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door
to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific
analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs,
particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T),
remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing
work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering
limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address
this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a
high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types
with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace
Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy
through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations.
Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking
counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro
suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This
benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and
provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development.
Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and
improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

*Qi Li, Kun Li, Haozhi Han, Honghui Shang, Xinfu He, Yunquan Zhang, Hong An, Ting Cao, Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmThinkers is a reinforcement learning framework for atomic-scale simulations, combining physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability by modeling particles as decision-making agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of achieving physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability simultaneously in scientific simulations, which classical and learning-based methods fail to deliver.

Method: Uses a reinforcement learning framework where particles act as agents with a shared policy network, trained under thermodynamic constraints, and employs a reweighting mechanism for statistical fidelity.

Result: Achieves full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single GPU, with up to 4963x faster computation and 485x lower memory usage compared to supercomputer-based methods.

Conclusion: SwarmThinkers represents a paradigm shift by unifying physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence in scientific simulations.

Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by
design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress,
this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo
ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer
efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We
present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts
atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system.
Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that
selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic
constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition
rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise
decision making. Training follows a centralized-training,
decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across
system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a
benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers
is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on
a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer.
It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower
memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers,
SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies
physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven
intelligence.

*Yunze Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POET improves AWP solving by offloading computations to Python, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address calculation errors in LLMs when solving algebraic word problems.

Method: Two-stage approach: predict equations and generate code (POET), and one-step code generation (Zero-shot POET).

Result: 95.3% on PEN, 98.0% on ALG514, and 95.5% on DRAW-1K.

Conclusion: POET effectively mitigates LLM calculation errors and sets new SOTA benchmarks.

Abstract: Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important
natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought
technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded
impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the
computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can
accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose
Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating
step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations
and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to
avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which
utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate
Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and
98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5%
on the DRAW-1K dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI necessitates ensuring its safety, trustworthiness, and reliability to foster public confidence and innovation.

Method: The report adopts a defence-in-depth model, categorizing AI safety research into Development, Assessment, and Control domains.

Result: The framework identifies key challenges in creating, evaluating, and managing AI systems to ensure safety.

Conclusion: A structured approach to AI safety research is essential for building a trusted ecosystem and mitigating risks.

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.

together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [221] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI architecture for scientific discovery, emphasizing closing abstraction, reasoning, and reality gaps over scaling models. It advocates for active inference systems with causal models, Bayesian planners, knowledge graphs, and closed-loop interaction with simulations and labs, while highlighting the enduring role of human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are limited in scientific discovery due to brittle reasoning, abstraction gaps, and separation from experimental reality. The paper aims to address these limitations by proposing a more integrated and adaptive AI architecture.

Method: The paper outlines an active inference AI system with: (i) causal self-supervised models, (ii) Bayesian-guarded planners, (iii) dynamic knowledge graphs, and (iv) closed-loop interaction with simulations and labs. Human judgment is integrated as a permanent component.

Result: The proposed architecture enables AI systems to simulate actions, distinguish causation from correlation, and refine understanding through empirical validation, fostering more robust scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Scientific discovery AI must bridge abstraction, reasoning, and reality gaps through active inference, grounded in causal models and human judgment, rather than relying solely on scale or compute.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark to evaluate AI agents' ability to reproduce scientific work, focusing on training GPT-2 models quickly. Despite detailed hints, current LLMs struggle to reimplement known innovations, highlighting limitations in automating scientific reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI agents' capability in reproducing scientific results, a critical skill for autonomous research, using the NanoGPT speedrun as a test case.

Method: The benchmark includes 19 tasks where agents use previous records' training scripts and hints (from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions) to improve GPT-2 training speed.

Result: Recent reasoning LLMs with state-of-the-art scaffolds fail to reimplement known innovations, even with detailed hints.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a simple, non-saturated measure of LLMs' ability to automate scientific reproduction, revealing current limitations.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to assess AI trustworthiness by combining ethical guidelines with algorithmic processes (PageRank and TrustRank), aiming for a balanced, quantitative, and holistic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI's pervasive societal impact and complexity necessitate reliable trustworthiness assessments, but current methods lack either quantification or holistic perspectives.

Method: The paper integrates ethical components of Trustworthy AI with algorithmic processes like PageRank and TrustRank to create a quantitative yet holistic assessment framework.

Result: The proposed method successfully provides quantitative insights into AI trustworthiness while incorporating theoretical guidelines, reducing subjectivity in evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between ethical guidelines and algorithmic quantification, offering a more objective and comprehensive approach to assessing AI trustworthiness.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

TL;DR: Hecto introduces a lightweight MoE architecture combining GRU and FFNN experts for diverse reasoning tasks, achieving specialization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE models lack representational diversity due to identical inductive biases, limiting efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Hecto combines a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism.

Result: Hecto matches or closely trails homogeneous baselines, achieves clear expert specialization, and improves performance at larger batch sizes.

Conclusion: Hecto sets a new benchmark for conditional computation, offering specialized reasoning in low-resource regimes.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPIRAL is a self-play framework for language models to learn reasoning through zero-sum games, eliminating human supervision and achieving transferable reasoning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reasoning in language models without relying on human-curated data or domain-specific rewards.

Method: Uses self-play in zero-sum games with role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) for stable multi-agent training.

Result: Improves reasoning (8.6% on math, 8.4% on general reasoning) and transfers skills across domains.

Conclusion: Zero-sum games naturally foster transferable reasoning, offering a path for autonomous reasoning development.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

TL;DR: ChemActor, a fine-tuned LLM, converts chemical procedures into structured actions, using a sequential data framework and multi-round review for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating chemical procedure extraction is challenging due to ambiguous language and high annotation costs.

Method: Uses a fine-tuned LLM with a data selection module and multi-round review to generate structured actions from unstructured inputs.

Result: Achieves 10% better performance than baselines in R2D and D2A tasks.

Conclusion: ChemActor demonstrates advanced understanding and effectiveness in automating chemical procedure extraction.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

Result: CTFT-Net excels in extreme upsampling (2 kHz to 48 kHz) on the VCTK dataset, outperforming models like NU-Wave and WSRGlow.

Conclusion: CTFT-Net effectively reconstructs high frequencies without noisy artifacts, setting a new benchmark for SSR tasks.

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing
the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction,
recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved
perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency
Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex
domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention
block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex
conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency
reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and
multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization.
Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave,
WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling
(2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy
artifacts.

*Sebastian Murgul, Michael Heizmann*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in MIDI, outperforming existing methods with novel preprocessing and achieving high F1-scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing beat tracking methods focus on audio, leaving a gap for MIDI-based approaches, which are crucial for notation-level transcription and rhythm analysis.

Method: An end-to-end transformer model with encoder-decoder architecture, using dynamic augmentation and optimized tokenization for MIDI input to beat annotations.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art HMMs and deep learning methods, achieving competitive F1-scores across diverse datasets and musical styles.

Conclusion: Transformers show promise for symbolic beat tracking, with potential integration into automatic music transcription for improved analysis and score generation.

Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task
for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing
methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an
end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in
performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for
sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our
approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic
augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and
generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments
using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model
against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based
beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive
F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight
the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and
suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for
enhanced music analysis and score generation.

### [229] [MuteSwap: Silent Face-based Voice Conversion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00498)
*Yifan Liu, Yu Fang, Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuteSwap, a framework for Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), enabling voice conversion using only visual inputs from silent videos and target speaker images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional voice conversion requires audio inputs from both source and target speakers, which is impractical in scenarios like silent videos or noisy environments. SFVC addresses this limitation by relying solely on visual cues.

Method: MuteSwap uses contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimizes mutual information to separate shared visual features, enabling intelligible speech generation and identity conversion.

Result: MuteSwap performs well in speech synthesis and identity conversion, even in noisy conditions where audio-dependent methods fail.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of SFVC and the effectiveness of MuteSwap's training approach, highlighting its potential for applications where audio inputs are unavailable.

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source
speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However,
this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in
silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of
Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely
from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video
of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the
identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the
source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and
converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive
learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to
separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap
achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity
conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio
input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the
effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

*Minoru Kishi, Ryosuke Sakai, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Yusuke Kanamori, Yuki Okamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes AudioBERTScore, a novel objective metric for evaluating synthesized audio in TTA, outperforming conventional metrics by better correlating with subjective evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective evaluation in TTA is costly, and existing objective metrics like mel-cepstral distortion poorly correlate with human judgment.

Method: AudioBERTScore uses embeddings of synthesized and reference sounds, incorporating max-norm and $p$-norm to account for environmental sound characteristics.

Result: The proposed metric shows higher correlation with subjective evaluations compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: AudioBERTScore is a more effective objective evaluation tool for TTA models, bridging the gap between objective and subjective assessments.

Abstract: We propose a novel objective evaluation metric for synthesized audio in
text-to-audio (TTA), aiming to improve the performance of TTA models. In TTA,
subjective evaluation of the synthesized sound is an important, but its
implementation requires monetary costs. Therefore, objective evaluation such as
mel-cepstral distortion are used, but the correlation between these objective
metrics and subjective evaluation values is weak. Our proposed objective
evaluation metric, AudioBERTScore, calculates the similarity between embedding
of the synthesized and reference sounds. The method is based not only on the
max-norm used in conventional BERTScore but also on the $p$-norm to reflect the
non-local nature of environmental sounds. Experimental results show that scores
obtained by the proposed method have a higher correlation with subjective
evaluation values than conventional metrics.

TL;DR: The paper explores speech as a non-invasive indicator for suicide risk in adolescents, using LLMs for feature extraction and achieving 74% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early identification of suicide risk is critical, and speech offers an accessible mental health indicator.

Method: Combines large language models (LLMs) with acoustic and semantic features for analysis.

Result: Achieved 74% accuracy on the test set, ranking first in the SW1 challenge.

Conclusion: LLM-based methods show promise for suicide risk assessment through speech analysis.

Abstract: Early identification of suicide risk is crucial for preventing suicidal
behaviors. As a result, the identification and study of patterns and markers
related to suicide risk have become a key focus of current research. In this
paper, we present the results of our work in the 1st SpeechWellness Challenge
(SW1), which aims to explore speech as a non-invasive and easily accessible
mental health indicator for identifying adolescents at risk of suicide.Our
approach leverages large language model (LLM) as the primary tool for feature
extraction, alongside conventional acoustic and semantic features. The proposed
method achieves an accuracy of 74\% on the test set, ranking first in the SW1
challenge. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods for
analyzing speech in the context of suicide risk assessment.

### [232] [Multi-interaction TTS toward professional recording reproduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00808)
*Hiroki Kanagawa, Kenichi Fujita, Aya Watanabe, Yusuke Ijima*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A TTS method with multi-step interaction is proposed to enable iterative style refinement, mimicking voice actor-director feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS lacks fine-grained style refinement post-synthesis, often deviating from user intent.

Method: Models interaction between TTS and user, emulating voice actor-director dynamics for iterative refinement.

Result: Experiments show the model enables iterative style refinements based on user directions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully introduces multi-interaction capability for TTS style refinement.

Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by
providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative
feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has
been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained
style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the
synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address
this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows
users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models
the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship
between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed
model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in
accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction
capability. Sample audios are available: https://ntt-hilab-gensp.

### [233] [MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00966)
*Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jesper Jensen, Jan Østergaard, Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MambAttention, a hybrid model combining Mamba and time-frequency attention modules, outperforming existing models in speech enhancement tasks, especially on out-of-domain datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting in sequence models like LSTM and Mamba for speech enhancement, the paper explores hybrid architectures with attention modules for better generalization.

Method: Proposes MambAttention, integrating Mamba with shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules, trained on the challenging VB-DemandEx dataset.

Result: MambAttention outperforms state-of-the-art models on out-of-domain datasets (DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2) and matches performance on in-domain data (VB-DemandEx).

Conclusion: The hybrid MambAttention model demonstrates superior generalization, with ablation studies confirming the importance of weight sharing in attention modules.

Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies
have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in
single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and
self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has
demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the
training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding
self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for
single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid
Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance
have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech
enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended
(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging
noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our
proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar
complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020
and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset
VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the
time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization
performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a
notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our
MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all
reported evaluation metrics.

*Anthony Gibbons, Emma King, Ian Donohue, Andrew Parnell*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI models (ACGAN and DDPMs) for augmenting audio spectrogram data to improve rare species classification, achieving higher accuracy with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in obtaining labeled data for rare species classification and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods for audio spectrograms.

Method: Investigates ACGAN and DDPMs for synthesizing spectrograms, tests their realism and classification accuracy, and introduces a new labeled bird call dataset from wind farms.

Result: DDPMs outperformed in realism and accuracy, with combined real and synthetic data achieving 92.6% accuracy (vs. 90.5% with real data alone).

Conclusion: The approach can enhance acoustic signal augmentation for rare species detection, offering potential for reliable AI-based solutions.

Abstract: 1. Obtaining data to train robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based models
for species classification can be challenging, particularly for rare species.
Data augmentation can boost classification accuracy by increasing the diversity
of training data and is cheaper to obtain than expert-labelled data. However,
many classic image-based augmentation techniques are not suitable for audio
spectrograms. 2. We investigate two generative AI models as data augmentation
tools to synthesise spectrograms and supplement audio data: Auxiliary
Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN) and Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The latter performed particularly well in terms
of both realism of generated spectrograms and accuracy in a resulting
classification task. 3. Alongside these new approaches, we present a new audio
data set of 640 hours of bird calls from wind farm sites in Ireland,
approximately 800 samples of which have been labelled by experts. Wind farm
data are particularly challenging for classification models given the
background wind and turbine noise. 4. Training an ensemble of classification
models on real and synthetic data combined gave 92.6% accuracy (and 90.5% with
just the real data) when compared with highly confident BirdNET predictions. 5.
Our approach can be used to augment acoustic signals for more species and other
land-use types, and has the potential to bring about a step-change in our
capacity to develop reliable AI-based detection of rare species. Our code is

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores Text-To-Audio (TTA) synthesis, analyzing data, model architecture, and training strategies. It introduces AF-Synthetic dataset, compares design choices, and proposes ETTA, a model outperforming baselines and handling complex captions well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a holistic understanding of TTA model design choices, addressing gaps in knowledge about data, architecture, and training effects.

Method: Conducted large-scale experiments with diffusion and flow matching models, comparing architectures, training objectives, and sampling strategies. Introduced AF-Synthetic dataset and analyzed Pareto curves for sampling methods.

Result: Proposed ETTA model outperforms baselines on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, competes with proprietary-data models, and excels in generating audio for complex captions.

Conclusion: ETTA advances TTA synthesis, demonstrating the impact of systematic design choices and offering a robust solution for creative audio generation.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in Text-To-Audio (TTA) synthesis,
enabling users to enrich their creative workflows with synthetic audio
generated from natural language prompts. Despite this progress, the effects of
data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies
on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a
holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a
large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models.
Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality
synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic
comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices
for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with
respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge
obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed
Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps,
ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available
data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally,
we show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex
and imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current
benchmarks.

TL;DR: AudioTrust is a framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) across six dimensions, using a dataset of 4,420 samples and 9 audio-specific metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for ALLMs lack focus on audio-specific risks and scenarios, necessitating a dedicated trustworthiness assessment.

Method: AudioTrust includes 18 experimental setups, a dataset of real-world audio/text samples, and 9 audio-specific metrics for evaluation.

Result: The framework identifies trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of current ALLMs in high-risk audio scenarios.

Conclusion: AudioTrust provides insights for secure deployment of future audio models and is publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language
Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness.
However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly
concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored.
Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address
only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for
the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio
modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness
evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust
facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination,
safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate
these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental
setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text
samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency
calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the
multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully
designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale
automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs.
Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of
current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted
with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the
secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and
benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.

*Dake Guo, Jixun Yao, Linhan Ma, He Wang, Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: StreamFlow is a neural architecture for streaming speech generation using diffusion transformers (DiT) with block-wise attention masks, achieving high audio quality and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional token-to-waveform methods struggle with streaming due to global receptive fields and degraded quality in token-by-token streaming.

Method: Proposes StreamFlow with local block-wise receptive fields and hierarchical attention masks to manage long-sequence dependencies.

Result: Matches non-streaming methods in performance, surpasses other streaming methods in quality, and achieves 180 ms first-packet latency.

Conclusion: StreamFlow effectively addresses streaming challenges in speech generation, balancing quality and latency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have
highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality,
particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating
semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities
due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly
implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in
degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a
novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with
diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation
issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local
block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first
segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable
the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.
These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks
to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective
experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance
comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in
terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time
during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable
first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why local update algorithms like Local SGD outperform centralized methods in heterogeneous data settings.

Method: Uses a fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. Establishes tight bounds for various algorithms.

Result: Shows bounded second-order heterogeneity is necessary and sufficient for local updates to excel. Provides min-max complexity for problem classes and regret bounds for online federated learning.

Conclusion: Local updates offer provable advantages under specific heterogeneity conditions, with the thesis serving as a guide for analyzing Local SGD in such environments.

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update
algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization
under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded
second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and
sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in
convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower
bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes
the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a
fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper
finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed
heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated
learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit
feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer
provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for
analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: HDRAM introduces a symbolic memory framework for LLMs, addressing precision loss as information spreading, improving associative retrieval using CHQ principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from precision loss, reframed as information spreading, which is addressed by treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel.

Method: HDRAM uses hypertokens, integrating ECC, holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search, enabling efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search.

Result: HDRAM significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes.

Conclusion: CHQ principles can fortify transformer architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of HDRAM.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC
grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM
significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes,
demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can
fortify transformer architectures.

TL;DR: LiSER is a knowledge distillation framework for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) that uses unlabeled audio-visual data and teacher models to train lightweight student models, reducing reliance on labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice interfaces can enhance user interaction by recognizing emotions, but labeled data for SER is costly to collect. Multi-modal (audio-visual) cues improve SER, but data scarcity is a challenge.

Method: Proposes LiSER, a framework using knowledge distillation. Large teacher models (trained on speech and face representations) transfer knowledge to lightweight student models via unlabeled audio-visual data.

Result: Tested on RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, LiSER reduces the need for extensive labeled data while maintaining SER performance.

Conclusion: LiSER offers a cost-effective solution for SER by leveraging unlabeled data and knowledge distillation, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can
benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on
user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual
cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However,
collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive.
This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER
(LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher
models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers
knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher
models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark
datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence
on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

Motivation: To enhance interpretability and uncertainty quantification in IoT intrusion detection, addressing the need for trustworthy AI in edge deployments.

Method: Combines Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, decomposing predictions into truth, falsity, and indeterminacy components. Uses adaptive thresholds for review.

Result: 97% accuracy on IoT-CAD dataset; misclassified samples show higher indeterminacy (I=0.62 vs. I=0.24 for correct ones). Indeterminacy correlates with error likelihood.

Conclusion: NeutroSENSE improves accuracy and explainability, offering a trust-aware AI framework for IoT security, especially in edge deployments.

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework
for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the
system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and
indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and
abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using
both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD
dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that
misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62)
than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for
uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly
valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation
between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy,
human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic
enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for
trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

*Austin R. Ellis-Mohr, Anuj K. Nayak, Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS3, a framework for optimizing LLM inference costs by modeling it as stochastic traversal over a skill graph, enabling comparative analysis of strategies like CoT and ToT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing resource burden of LLM inference, which current compute-optimality characterizations overlook.

Method: Propose DS3, a framework for inference as stochastic skill graph traversal, and derive closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost.

Result: The framework theoretically explains empirical patterns like linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute and variation in inference strategies.

Conclusion: DS3 enhances understanding of training-inference interdependencies, aiding algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and
financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for
training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now
represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,
particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of
compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens
in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating
points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general
framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned
skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive
closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range
of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought
(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and
model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite
graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge
DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We
theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy
scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies
as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior
elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;
and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified
analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference
interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports
principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

*Nathan Vaartjes, Vincent Francois-Lavet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An RL-based elevator control system outperforms traditional methods by handling stochastic and combinatorial challenges with innovative action space encoding and tailored rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient elevator traffic management is crucial for minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption, but existing heuristic or pattern-based controllers struggle with stochastic and combinatorial complexities.

Method: The paper models a six-elevator, fifteen-floor system as a Markov Decision Process, using RL with innovations like action space encoding, infra-steps for continuous arrivals, and tailored rewards. Dueling Double Deep Q-learning is explored.

Result: The RL-based system adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns and outperforms traditional rule-based algorithms in a stochastic environment.

Conclusion: The proposed RL approach effectively addresses the challenges of elevator dispatching, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for large buildings.

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for
minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or
pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and
combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor
system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train
an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS).
Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the
combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of
infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward
signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to
adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL
architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the
proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a
highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based
algorithm.

### [244] [Towards Undistillable Models by Minimizing Conditional Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00012)
*Linfeng Ye, Shayan Mohajer Hamidi, En-hui Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (CMIM) to create undistillable DNNs by minimizing conditional mutual information (CMI) alongside cross-entropy loss, ensuring knockoff students underperform label-smoothed ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect DNN intellectual property by making models undistillable, preventing effective knowledge distillation.

Method: Proposes CMIM training, jointly minimizing cross-entropy loss and CMI values of temperature-scaled clusters.

Result: CMIM models are undistillable by tested KD methods and outperform CE-trained models in accuracy.

Conclusion: CMIM effectively creates undistillable DNNs while improving prediction accuracy, safeguarding intellectual property.

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a
black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge
distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the
knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with
label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect
intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To
this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait
that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all
sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the
extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse
into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring
the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information
(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,
which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)
loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire
temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive
experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the
literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from
the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM
model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss
alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

*Hyunwoo Seo, Chiehyeon Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-MTM improves time-series forecasting by combining masked modeling with seasonal-trend decomposition and contrastive learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked time-series modeling ignores inherent semantic structures, leading to spurious patterns. Addressing entangled temporal patterns through decomposition can enhance forecasting.

Method: ST-MTM uses seasonal-trend decomposition with novel masking strategies: period masking for seasonal components and sub-series masking for trend components, plus contrastive learning for consistency.

Result: ST-MTM consistently outperforms existing masked modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

Conclusion: Decomposition-based masking and contrastive learning in ST-MTM effectively capture temporal semantics, improving forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that
involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling
has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by
reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic
information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations
generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series
ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious
temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal
semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled
patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a
masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which
includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that
incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a
period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked
seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking
strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar
variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task
for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,
ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by
enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal
representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves
consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked
modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

Conclusion: SWE-Bench-CL offers a robust tool for developing adaptive AI agents in software engineering, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on static
code-generation benchmarks, but real-world software development unfolds as a
continuous stream of evolving issues, fixes, and feature requests. We introduce
SWE-Bench-CL, a novel continual learning benchmark built on the human-verified

resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a
preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual
sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented
with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized
continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting,
forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite
Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the
stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol
comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python
repositories. All code and data are publicly available at

### [247] [Vision Transformer with Adversarial Indicator Token against Adversarial Attacks in Radio Signal Classifications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00015)
*Lu Zhang, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Gan Zheng, Guisheng Liao, Xuekang Liu, Fabio Roli, Carsten Maple*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel vision transformer (ViT) with an adversarial indicator (AdvI) token is proposed to defend against adversarial attacks in modulation classification, combining training and runtime defenses in one model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are widely used but vulnerable to adversarial attacks in modulation classification for IoT devices, necessitating a robust defensive strategy.

Method: Introduces an AdvI token in ViT to detect attacks, integrates adversarial training, and examines attention mechanisms to highlight suspicious features.

Result: The method outperforms others in handling white-box attacks like FGM, PGD, and BIM, showing effective defense.

Conclusion: The AdvI token in ViT provides a unified and efficient defense against adversarial attacks in modulation classification.

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their
applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in
the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has
been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is
susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this
issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation
classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new
concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial
attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an
AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an
adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we
combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural
network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to
detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into
the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.
We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,
influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in
the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through
experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several
competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those
utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and
basic iterative method.

### [248] [Gradient-based Fine-Tuning through Pre-trained Model Regularization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00016)
*Xuanbo Liu, Liu Liu, Fuxiang Wu, Fusheng Hao, Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRFT is an efficient fine-tuning method for large pre-trained models, reducing storage and computational costs by updating selective weight matrix rows/columns and incorporating regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large models is resource-intensive. Existing methods like GPS reduce parameters but increase resource demands. GRFT aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: GRFT updates rows/columns of weight matrices with the highest sum of squared gradients, reducing storage and improving selection efficiency. It also uses regularization for better knowledge transfer.

Result: GRFT outperforms GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA, updating only 1.22% (FGVC) and 0.30% (VTAB) of parameters while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GRFT is a highly efficient and effective fine-tuning method, significantly reducing resource usage while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

*Bo Wang, Qinyuan Cheng, Runyu Peng, Rong Bao, Peiji Li, Qipeng Guo, Linyang Li, Zhiyuan Zeng, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework linking Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in LLM post-training, showing they operate in the same optimal policy-reward subspace. It identifies a limitation in SFT's KL divergence term and proposes solutions like learning rate reduction and alternative SFT objectives, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between SFT and preference learning in LLM post-training and address the limitations of conventional SFT methods.

Method: Theoretical analysis and mathematical derivation to unify SFT and preference learning, followed by proposing learning rate reduction and alternative SFT objectives based on f-divergence functions.

Result: Up to 25% relative gain and 6% absolute win rate improvement in instruction-following tasks.

Conclusion: The unified framework and proposed methods enhance LLM post-training, with theoretical and experimental validation of the relationship between SFT and preference learning.

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes and compares three quantum-inspired data encoding strategies (ILS, GDS, CCVS) for classical ML models, focusing on reducing encoding time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize quantum-inspired data transformations for classical ML by reducing encoding time and analyzing their impact on classification performance.

Method: Three encoding strategies are evaluated: ILS (instance-level), GDS (global discrete), and CCVS (class-conditional). Their efficiency, correctness, and impact on model accuracy are assessed.

Result: The study provides insights into trade-offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance for each strategy.

Conclusion: The findings help optimize quantum-inspired data encoding for classical ML workflows.

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data
encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy
(GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical
data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The
primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct
encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The
Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local
quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique
feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In
contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique
values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their
impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational
cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and
predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum
inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used to improve Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating flexible prior proposals, outperforming traditional Karhunen-Loève Expansion (KLE) in subsurface flow modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like KLE require prior knowledge of covariance functions, which is often unavailable. The VAE offers a data-driven alternative to capture diverse correlation structures.

Method: The study employs a VAE framework to generate prior proposals for McMC, tested on a synthetic groundwater flow inversion problem.

Result: VAE matches KLE's accuracy when correlation length is known and outperforms KLE when assumptions are incorrect. It also reduces stochastic dimensionality, enhancing efficiency.

Conclusion: Deep generative models like VAE can make Bayesian inference in high-dimensional problems more adaptable and efficient.

Abstract: This study uses a Variational Autoencoder method to enhance the efficiency
and applicability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating
broader-spectrum prior proposals. Traditional approaches, such as the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE), require previous knowledge of the covariance
function, often unavailable in practical applications. The VAE framework
enables a data-driven approach to flexibly capture a broader range of
correlation structures in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly subsurface
flow modeling. The methodology is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow
inversion problem, where pressure data is used to estimate permeability fields.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the VAE-based parameterization achieves
comparable accuracy to KLE when the correlation length is known and outperforms
KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Moreover,
the VAE approach significantly reduces stochastic dimensionality, improving
computational efficiency. The results suggest that leveraging deep generative
models in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian
inference in high-dimensional problems.

TL;DR: AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework, addresses challenges in high-dimensional materials design by augmenting data, refining predictions with LLMs, and incorporating expert knowledge, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reconcile high-dimensional materials composition space with limited experimental data and improve reliability and expert knowledge integration in machine learning-driven inverse design.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with difference-based algorithms for data augmentation, LLM-guided refinement for prediction correction, and knowledge-based reward functions.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in efficiency, convergence, and success rates; successfully synthesized a high-performance Zr-based alloy matching predictions.

Conclusion: AIMatDesign demonstrates reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery, accurately capturing material property trends.

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse
design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional
materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches
suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack
reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the
design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert
knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.
To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning
framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data
using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,
accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated
refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects
prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and
state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function
leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during
training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses
traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery
efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates
proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based
alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\%
elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately
captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating
its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

TL;DR: FNSDA is a parameter-efficient method for generalizing to new dynamics by adapting in Fourier space, outperforming existing methods with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for modeling dynamics struggle with generalization to unseen systems governed by the same dynamics but differing in environmental characteristics.

Method: FNSDA identifies shareable dynamics via automatic partition in Fourier modes and adjusts modes for new environments using low-dimensional latent parameters.

Result: FNSDA achieves superior or competitive generalization performance on four dynamic systems with reduced parameter cost.

Conclusion: FNSDA offers an efficient and effective solution for generalizing to new dynamics, with potential applications in complex physical systems.

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has
shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics.
However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable
predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen
systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in
environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient
method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can
readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space.
Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known
environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust
the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional
latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our
approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results
show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance
compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost. Our

TL;DR: ROSE is a framework using multi-objective reinforcement learning to generate diverse and context-rich adversarial prompts for evaluating LLM safety, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations for LLMs are static and labor-intensive, failing to adapt to rapid advancements. Automated methods lack topic diversity and real-world alignment.

Method: ROSE employs multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM, generating diverse and contextually rich prompts.

Result: ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in LLMs, improving integrated evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: ROSE advances practical, reality-oriented safety evaluation for LLMs, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper
contains examples of potentially harmful text.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiT-JEPA is a hierarchical framework for multi-scale urban trajectory representation, combining fine-grained details and high-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to integrate fine-grained details and high-level summaries in trajectory data, limiting their ability to capture both local and global patterns.

Method: HiT-JEPA uses a three-layer hierarchy to capture point-level details, intermediate patterns, and high-level abstractions in trajectories.

Result: Experiments show HiT-JEPA produces richer, multi-scale representations, improving trajectory similarity computation.

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA effectively unifies local and global trajectory semantics, advancing urban trajectory analysis.

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

*Wenbing Li, Zikai Song, Hang Zhou, Yunyao Zhang, Junqing Yu, Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA-Mixer integrates LoRA experts into MoE for efficient multi-task adaptation in LLMs, improving performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for combining LoRA with MoE in LLMs are inefficient, either swapping entire layers or adding parallel branches, reducing parameter efficiency and task fidelity.

Method: LoRA-Mixer replaces projection matrices in attention modules with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts, supporting joint optimization or frozen pre-trained modules. It uses a hard-soft routing strategy and a Specialization Balance Loss for robust training.

Result: LoRA-Mixer improves performance by up to 7.61% on benchmarks like GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with 48% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: LoRA-Mixer is a lightweight, efficient framework for multi-task adaptation in LLMs, achieving strong performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit
prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers
for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter
efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and
lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation
lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's
input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.
This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,
including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their
inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational
paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a
novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,
frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router
training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and
maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss
(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique to improve mobility flow forecasting in sparse data, showing a 9.85% reduction in test MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate human mobility modeling is crucial for epidemic control, but sparse spatial data limits conventional models.

Method: SPN aggregates signals from neighboring hexagonal grid cells to augment features, tested on NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net models.

Result: SPN consistently enhances forecasting, reducing test MSE by up to 9.85%.

Conclusion: Spatial smoothing of sparse mobility data is a simple, effective method for robust forecasting during health crises.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of human mobility is critical for understanding epidemic
spread and deploying timely interventions. In this work, we leverage a
large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital
Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast
mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial
sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits
the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we
propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)
technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its
immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting
backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input
lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting
performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings
demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple
yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public
health crises.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual
reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management
advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in
extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints,
and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between
model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we
propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale
$\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The
novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal
features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then
enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization
(DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT
image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited
data for RRG tasks.

TL;DR: This paper compiles and digitizes a CHF dataset for AI/ML benchmarking, highlighting the limitations of classical correlations and neural networks under non-uniform heating conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark by providing curated datasets and baseline results for advanced modeling.

Method: Heating profiles were extracted, interpolated, validated, and encoded in machine-readable formats. Classical correlations and neural networks were evaluated.

Result: Classical correlations and neural networks trained on uniform data fail under non-uniform heating, emphasizing the need for models incorporating axial power distributions.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational data for future transfer-learning, uncertainty quantification, and design-optimization in CHF benchmarking.

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water
reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II
of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power
profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both
uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were
extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh,
validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats
for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating
and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular
methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network
trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to
generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models
that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these
curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork
for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification,
and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

TL;DR: IDRIFTNET, a hybrid physics-driven deep learning model, outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting iceberg trajectories by combining analytical drift physics with residual learning and spectral neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate iceberg trajectory forecasting is challenging due to sparse data and complex environmental influences, limiting deep learning models' effectiveness.

Method: Proposes IDRIFTNET, integrating analytical drift physics with a residual learning model and rotate-augmented spectral neural network to capture global and local patterns.

Result: IDRIFTNET achieves lower Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) compared to other models on Antarctic icebergs A23A and B22A.

Conclusion: IDRIFTNET effectively forecasts iceberg trajectories under limited data and dynamic conditions, demonstrating superior performance over existing models.

Abstract: Drifting icebergs in the polar oceans play a key role in the Earth's climate
system, impacting freshwater fluxes into the ocean and regional ecosystems
while also posing a challenge to polar navigation. However, accurately
forecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due
to the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of
iceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg
motion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a
highly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These
limitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture
the underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address
these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep
learning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift
physics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the
pattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth
observations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network
that captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future
iceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with
state-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings
demonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final
Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety
of time points. These results highlight IDRIFTNET's effectiveness in capturing
the complex, nonlinear drift of icebergs for forecasting iceberg trajectories
under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.

TL;DR: A novel neuron-centric model fusion algorithm integrates multiple neural networks into one, outperforming prior methods, especially in zero-shot and non-IID scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model fusion is challenging due to differences in internal representations like permutation invariance or varied training data. The goal is to create a unified model capturing all parent models' strengths.

Method: The approach groups intermediate neurons of parent models using neuron attribution scores, creating target representations for the fused model. It works with arbitrary layer types.

Result: The algorithm consistently outperforms previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID scenarios.

Conclusion: The neuron-centric fusion method effectively integrates diverse neural networks, offering superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one
representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents.
However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal
representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random
initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel,
neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple
trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of
training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent
models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with
its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach
incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore,
our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently
outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID
fusion scenarios. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data reduction strategy using Pointwise V-information (PVI) to enhance model training efficiency by selecting optimal instances, preserving performance while reducing data volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving data quality and training efficiency by selecting the most informative instances rather than using entire datasets.

Method: Quantifies instance difficulty with PVI, filters low-difficulty instances statically, and uses progressive learning on instances sorted by ascending PVI.

Result: Removing 10%-30% of data preserves classifier performance with minimal accuracy loss (0.0001%-0.76%). Progressive learning achieves a 0.8% accuracy gain.

Conclusion: The PVI-based strategy enhances model performance and training efficiency, with successful cross-lingual application to Chinese NLP tasks.

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most
informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training
efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal
instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy
based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty
using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.
Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the
classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we
use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances
sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy
gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective
data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset
could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we
have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English
datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable
insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The codes are

*Lucas Potin, Rosa Figueiredo, Vincent Labatut, Christine Largeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares 38 quality measures for graph classification, evaluates their theoretical properties and empirical performance, and introduces a clustering-based preprocessing step to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a focused comparison of quality measures for graph classification leads to the arbitrary use of popular measures without thorough evaluation.

Method: The study theoretically characterizes 38 quality measures, benchmarks them using public datasets, and introduces a clustering-based preprocessing step to group patterns.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that some widely used measures underperform, while the proposed preprocessing step reduces pattern count without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for selecting quality measures in graph classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering-based preprocessing.

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and
attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network
analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task,
those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the
patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify
meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a
function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the
literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the
most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to
provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically
focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most
widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we
present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We
characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We
leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a
method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these
resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of
pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a
clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the
same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to
be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that
some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the
best results.

TL;DR: Smooth-Distill is a self-distillation framework for HAR and sensor placement detection using a unified CNN, MTL-net, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of traditional distillation methods and improve multitask learning for HAR and sensor placement detection.

Method: Uses MTL-net, a CNN-based architecture, with a smoothed historical model as the teacher for self-distillation, tested on a new dataset and two public ones.

Result: Outperforms alternatives in HAR and placement detection, showing stable convergence and reduced overfitting.

Conclusion: Smooth-Distill offers an efficient, accurate solution for multitask learning with accelerometer data, reducing training costs for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework
designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor
placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes
a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data
and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional
distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the
proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself
as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while
maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a
comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures
across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public
datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill
consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition
and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced
stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced
overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This
framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation
in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for
multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training
efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training,
which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on
resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at

TL;DR: FPG introduces fractional calculus into policy gradients for long-term temporal modeling, reducing variance and improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy gradients suffer from high variance and inefficiency due to Markovian assumptions. FPG addresses this by leveraging long-range temporal dependencies.

Method: FPG uses Caputo fractional derivatives to reformulate gradients, enabling power-law temporal correlations. It includes an efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference errors.

Result: FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction (O(t^(-alpha))) and shows 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction over baselines.

Conclusion: FPG provides a mathematically grounded, computationally efficient framework for leveraging long-term dependencies in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We propose Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning
framework incorporating fractional calculus for long-term temporal modeling in
policy optimization. Standard policy gradient approaches face limitations from
Markovian assumptions, exhibiting high variance and inefficient sampling. By
reformulating gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes
power-law temporal correlations between state transitions. We develop an
efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference
errors with constant time and memory requirements. Theoretical analysis shows
FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction of order O(t^(-alpha)) versus
standard policy gradients while preserving convergence. Empirical validation
demonstrates 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction
versus state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides a mathematically
grounded approach for leveraging long-range dependencies without computational
overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the dynamics of self-improvement in LLMs, introducing the solver-verifier gap concept to model performance evolution and predict outcomes early in training. It also examines the impact of external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM performance evolves during self-improvement and the role of the solver-verifier gap, as well as the influence of external data.

Method: Theoretical modeling of self-improvement dynamics using the solver-verifier gap, followed by empirical validation on various LLMs and datasets.

Result: The solver-verifier gap effectively explains performance enhancement, and early training epochs can predict ultimate self-improvement power. External data's impact is minimal in limited regimes.

Conclusion: The solver-verifier gap is key to understanding self-improvement in LLMs, and external data can be flexibly used without major performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of
large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without
relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM
performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored.
In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement
via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that
the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between
LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical
framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of
self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We
empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs
and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate
how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we
find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be
utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which
accords with the empirical observations.

TL;DR: The paper explores how patch-based time series foundation models achieve cross-domain success despite the intuitive implausibility, linking their performance to latent probabilistic representations akin to language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the paradox of time series models' empirical success in cross-domain transfer despite data reflecting distinct dynamical systems.

Method: Investigates representation learning and generalization through theoretical and experimental analysis of patch-based time series models.

Result: Demonstrates that time series patches can be quantized into a discrete vocabulary with statistical properties similar to natural language, enabling robust representation and transfer.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving the safety and reliability of time series foundation models.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation
models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in
multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models
represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional
expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,
this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct
dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet
this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,
this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,
the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of
patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not
merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the
representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic
vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our
theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous
time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary
whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural
language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust
representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby
explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work
provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and
improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedHLM is a hybrid language model framework combining SLMs and LLMs, using federated learning to optimize token-level uncertainty thresholds, reducing LLM transmissions by over 95% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HLMs face high communication overhead due to frequent offloading to LLMs for uncertain predictions. FedHLM aims to reduce this overhead while maintaining accuracy.

Method: FedHLM integrates uncertainty-aware inference with federated learning to collaboratively learn dynamic thresholds for LLM assistance. It also uses P2P token resolution and hierarchical model aggregation.

Result: FedHLM reduces LLM transmissions by over 95% with negligible accuracy loss in large-scale news classification tasks.

Conclusion: FedHLM is scalable and efficient for edge-AI applications, significantly cutting communication costs while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small
Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM
inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when
local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low
or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still
require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication
overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,
a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware
inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in
collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when
LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned
thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a
privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages
embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,
enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without
engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge
servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while
cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered
design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.
Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces
LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it
well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Result: IA-STGNN reduces MAE by 12.8% and increases Top-5% accuracy by 18.4%, enhancing causal path consistency and intervention stability.

Conclusion: IA-STGNN provides a transparent AI decision-support tool for high-level policy modeling, applicable in nuclear deterrence, diplomatic assessment, and strategy optimization.

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical
strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations,
particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables
within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We
propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN),
a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic

Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 +

significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost),
achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFEN is a novel framework for traffic speed prediction, combining topological spatiotemporal graph fusion and adaptive smoothing to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic prediction methods struggle with complexity, non-linearity, and static techniques for non-stationary data, limiting adaptability.

Method: GFEN uses topological spatiotemporal graph fusion and a hybrid approach (k-th order difference and attention-based deep learning) to model multi-scale features and smooth data.

Result: GFEN improves prediction accuracy by 6.3% and converges twice as fast as hybrid models.

Conclusion: GFEN's superior performance and efficiency make it a promising solution for enhancing traffic prediction systems.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and
non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and
temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static
techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which
limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these
challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative
framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel
topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts
and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and
network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale
spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology
combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an
attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical
observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates
nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior
performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: pUniFind is a multimodal pre-trained model for proteomics, integrating peptide-spectrum scoring and de novo sequencing, outperforming traditional methods with improved sensitivity and modification coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models in mass spectrometry are limited to feature extraction, lacking unified scoring frameworks for proteomic analysis.

Method: pUniFind is trained on 100M spectra, using cross-modality prediction to align spectral and peptide data, and includes a quality control module.

Result: Achieves 42.6% more peptide identifications, 60% more PSMs than de novo methods, and recovers 38.5% additional peptides with full fragment coverage.

Conclusion: pUniFind establishes a scalable, unified deep learning framework for proteomics, enhancing sensitivity, modification coverage, and interpretability.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most
models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We
present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in
proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open,
zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived
spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality
prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets,
particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified
peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind
identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a
300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module
further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the
genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion
coverage. These results establish a unified, scalable deep learning framework
for proteomic analysis, offering improved sensitivity, modification coverage,
and interpretability.

*Aho Yapi, Pierre Latouche, Arnaud Guillin, Yan Bailly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for short-term occupational accident forecasting using safety inspections and binary time series models, with LSTM outperforming other methods (0.86 balanced accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making by converting routine safety inspections into actionable weekly risk scores for proactive accident prevention.

Method: Uses binary time series modeling, sliding-window cross-validation, and compares machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, tree-based models, neural networks). LSTM is identified as the best performer.

Result: LSTM achieves 0.86 balanced accuracy in detecting high-risk periods, demonstrating the framework's robustness.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively transforms inspection data into weekly risk scores, aiding proactive safety planning and resource allocation.

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident
forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences
as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then
aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To
ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply
a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time
series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level
metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression,
tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared
within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory
(LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming
high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness
of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can
anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed
methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk
scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers
can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection
priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites
or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and
getting the greatest return on safety investments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares data generation methods for optimizing firefighter resource allocation, evaluating their effectiveness using domain-specific and standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve firefighter response optimization by generating high-quality synthetic data for scenario simulations.

Method: Comparison of Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard GANs, Conditional Tabular GANs, and Diffusion Probabilistic Models, evaluated with domain-specific and Wasserstein distance metrics.

Result: The study highlights the challenges of generating synthetic data for highly unbalanced, non-Gaussian distributions and assesses methods' efficacy in capturing real-world intricacies.

Conclusion: Domain-specific metrics are crucial for evaluating synthetic data quality in firefighting scenarios, as traditional metrics may not suffice.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case
of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to
experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the
global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then
mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare
different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular
Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are
examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of
firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in
capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world
scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is
conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the
firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance.
Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal
distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are
designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex
correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the
conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational
relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of
being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian
distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional quality control (lack of adaptability) and black-box machine learning models (lack of interpretability) in industrial settings.

Method: Integrates supervised machine learning for fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for interpretability, and domain-specific visualization. Evaluates explanations via perturbation analysis and expert assessment.

Result: Achieves 95.9% fault detection accuracy; explanations are validated as relevant and interpretable.

Conclusion: The human-centric approach enhances trust in data-driven fault detection, benefiting industrial quality control.

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial,
particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control
approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack
adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and
necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such
as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically
function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial
environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a
methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and
transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for
multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc
interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps
model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study
proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through
quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative
expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a
safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time
series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both
quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed
the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This
human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in
data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in
industrial quality control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores text-to-level generation using diffusion models, addressing practical needs like caption/level pairs and playable level generation. It compares results with other models and introduces a GUI for designers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance text-to-level generation in tile-based games, addressing gaps in using diffusion models for this purpose.

Method: Automatically assigns captions to levels, trains diffusion models with pretrained and simple transformer text encoders, and evaluates diversity and playability.

Result: The best diffusion model uses a simple transformer, trains faster, and performs comparably to models with complex encoders.

Conclusion: Simpler text encoders can be effective for text-to-level generation, and a GUI aids in practical level design.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate
tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level
generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a
usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and
a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We
present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing
level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders
and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically
assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and
output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability
of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion
model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level
approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model
uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to
train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating
that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI
allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

TL;DR: A foundation model for behavioral signals from wearables improves health predictions, outperforming in tasks like sleep prediction and combining well with raw sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral data from wearables is more informative for health predictions than low-level sensor data, but foundation models have not been tailored for it.

Method: Developed foundation models using 2.5B hours of wearable data from 162K individuals, optimizing architectures and tokenization strategies.

Result: Strong performance on 57 health tasks, excelling in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, with further improvement when combined with raw sensor data.

Conclusion: Tailoring foundation models to wearables enhances health predictions and enables new applications.

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve
health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such
predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite
behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with
physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation
models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from
162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization
strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our
model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including
individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The
model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves
further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results
underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and
demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training for image reconstruction poses privacy risks (data leakage, inference attacks) and high computational costs.

Method: Integrates Federated Learning, local differential privacy, and robust model watermarking to secure data on local devices.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to centralized methods, reduces computational burden, and mitigates security/privacy risks.

Conclusion: PPFL-RDSN is a practical solution for secure, privacy-preserving collaborative computer vision.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality images from low-resolution inputs using Residual
Dense Spatial Networks (RDSNs) is crucial yet challenging, particularly in
collaborative scenarios where centralized training poses significant privacy
risks, including data leakage and inference attacks, as well as high
computational costs. We propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated
Learning-based RDSN (PPFL-RDSN) framework specifically tailored for lossy image
reconstruction. PPFL-RDSN integrates Federated Learning (FL), local
differential privacy, and robust model watermarking techniques, ensuring data
remains secure on local devices, safeguarding sensitive information, and
maintaining model authenticity without revealing underlying data. Empirical
evaluations show that PPFL-RDSN achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art centralized methods while reducing computational burdens, and
effectively mitigates security and privacy vulnerabilities, making it a

TL;DR: A novel framework combines ResNet and Transformer heatmaps for improved interpretability, addressing spatial-temporal misalignment. It achieves high accuracy in clinical and industrial datasets and includes an NLP module for narrative explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods suffer from spatial-temporal misalignment, limiting actionable insights in critical domains like healthcare and industrial monitoring.

Method: Integrates gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, ensuring spatial-temporal alignment. Includes an NLP module for narrative explanations.

Result: Achieves 94.1% accuracy on PhysioNet and RMSE = 0.28 kWh on UCI Energy dataset, outperforming baselines by 3.8-12.4%. NLP module scores BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L (0.650).

Conclusion: The framework bridges technical outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering scalable, transparent decision-making with causal fidelity and alignment.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model
interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a
restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address
the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing
interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global
context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes
actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial
monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and
Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full
spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical
evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy
consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the
hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and
reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy
Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and
InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps
into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds
suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L
(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and
spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical
outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for
transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Result: Standard RL algorithms perform competitively in Gym4ReaL, highlighting their potential for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Gym4ReaL bridges the gap between idealized benchmarks and real-world RL needs, encouraging further method development.

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable
progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated
environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications,
the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such
as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.
Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current
benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary
environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities
explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive
suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and
evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite
includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of
practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings,
standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based
benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the
potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

TL;DR: FEDMOSAIC improves personalized federated learning by enabling adaptive collaboration among clients, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in non-IID settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning, where many PFL methods fail to surpass local or centralized baselines.

Method: Proposes FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method where clients exchange predictions on shared unlabeled data, making fine-grained trust decisions.

Result: Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art PFL methods in diverse non-IID settings with convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of data-aware collaboration for robust personalization in federated learning.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and
personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to
each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or
centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they
enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive
collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on
others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We
instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in
which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This
enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with
parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the
agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global
pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence.
Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across
diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard
assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration
for robust and effective personalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how reject relations affect stimulus equivalence (SE) in computational models, finding that artificial neural networks may rely on associative learning rather than SE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the contentious role of reject relations in SE and assess whether computational models truly demonstrate equivalence class formation.

Method: Used feedforward neural networks (FFNs), BERT, and GPT across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample simulations, varying training structures, relation types, and negative comparison selection. A probabilistic agent served as a benchmark.

Result: Reject relations influenced performance, with some models achieving high accuracy but resembling associative learning. Transformer models showed similar behavior.

Conclusion: Artificial neural networks may not truly demonstrate SE, highlighting the need for stricter criteria and careful handling of reject relations in computational models.

Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE),
yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence
class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject
relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational
models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained
transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS)
simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series,
one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and
select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A
probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative
learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks
could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance
reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced
agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence
tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this
performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest
that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on
associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful
consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational
models of equivalence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL) to address overestimation in deep RL, showing it outperforms Double DQN in reducing overestimation and improving performance across 57 Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overestimation is a common issue in RL, particularly in Q-learning and its deep variants like DQN. While Double Q-learning mitigates this, its deep adaptation (Double DQN) lacks the full benefits of training two Q-functions. This paper explores DDQL to better address overestimation.

Method: The study adapts Double Q-learning's core idea for deep RL, training two Q-functions that bootstrap off each other. It evaluates DDQL's performance, network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling.

Result: DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms Double DQN across 57 Atari 2600 games without extra hyperparameters.

Conclusion: DDQL effectively addresses overestimation in deep RL, offering a performant alternative to Double DQN.

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in
Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL
algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address
Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to
de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets.
Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks
(DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN.
However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the
training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this
paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for
value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our
aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN
and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions
affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms
Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring
additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including
its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for learning reduced-order models of nonlinear PDEs that preserves their structure and underlying physics, addressing challenges in computational efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Uses energy-quadratization to transform PDEs into quadratic lifted systems, derives quadratic reduced terms analytically, and formulates a constrained optimization problem to learn linear reduced operators.

Result: Demonstrates the method's effectiveness through numerical examples, showing competitive accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Lift & Learn method successfully preserves structure and physics in reduced-order models, offering a computationally efficient and accurate solution for nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift & Learn, a scientific machine
learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn
structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach
based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses
knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent
quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics
obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making
model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted
quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms
analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained
optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a
structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields
computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the
underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the
generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed
structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the
one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the
two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional
Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed
learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving
data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: MamNet effectively detects anomalies across time scales; future work includes optimizing with external event data for better adaptability.

Abstract: The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security
threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and
anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic
management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly
detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and
frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term
dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain
modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using
Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion
layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to
detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and
CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream
models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an
improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex
traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that
MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time
scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and
traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by
incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's
adaptability and stability in complex network environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoDS introduces a method for open-ended autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) using Bayesian surprise and Monte Carlo tree search, outperforming competitors by generating more surprising discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASD methods rely on human-specified questions or flawed heuristics, limiting exploration. AutoDS aims to accelerate discovery by letting AI drive exploration using Bayesian surprise.

Method: AutoDS quantifies epistemic shifts (Bayesian surprise) and uses Monte Carlo tree search with surprisal as a reward to explore nested hypotheses.

Result: AutoDS outperforms competitors, producing 5-29% more surprising discoveries across 21 datasets. Two-thirds of its findings surprised domain experts.

Conclusion: AutoDS advances open-ended ASD by effectively navigating hypothesis spaces and generating meaningful, surprising discoveries.

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on
answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent
works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven
settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis
generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by
allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few
existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity
heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former
struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the
latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a
method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using
Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior
beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering
experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,
our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive
widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the
setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains
such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results
demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms
competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.
Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are
surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward
towards building open-ended ASD systems.

*Christiana Westlin, Ashutosh Singh, Deniz Erdogmus, Georgios Stratis, Lisa Feldman Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that emotion categories are biologically and psychologically distinct by reanalyzing data from a study that mapped brain patterns to emotion categories. The reanalysis, guided by a view of emotions as variable instances, found significant individual variation, undermining the original findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the widely held assumption that emotion categories are biologically and psychologically distinct, and to demonstrate how starting assumptions can influence scientific conclusions.

Method: Reanalyzed data from a typologically-guided study using a minimal-assumption approach, treating emotion categories as populations of variable instances.

Result: The reanalysis did not replicate the original mappings and instead revealed significant variation in brain patterns across individuals within emotion categories.

Conclusion: Scientific conclusions are shaped by starting assumptions, and hypotheses should be tested with multiple methods before being accepted.

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TarFlowLM, a novel framework for language modeling in continuous latent spaces using autoregressive normalizing flows, offering flexibility in context capture, generation, and hierarchical processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternatives to traditional discrete token-based autoregressive models by leveraging continuous latent spaces for greater modeling flexibility.

Method: Proposes TarFlowLM, which uses transformer-based autoregressive normalizing flows to model continuous representations, enabling bi-directional context, block-wise generation, and hierarchical multi-pass processes.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on language modeling benchmarks and highlights the framework's flexible capabilities.

Conclusion: TarFlowLM provides a promising alternative to discrete autoregressive models, offering enhanced flexibility and performance in language modeling.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling.
Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and
single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the
exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling
flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting
language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We
propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based
autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations.
This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of
models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked,
alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise
generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical
multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling
transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent
space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to
conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language
modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the
flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

*Yilie Huang, Xun Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism for RL in continuous-time stochastic LQ control, improving efficiency and matching sublinear regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and tuning challenges of fixed exploration schedules in RL for LQ control problems.

Method: Proposes a model-free, data-driven approach with adaptive entropy regularization and policy variance adjustments.

Result: Achieves sublinear regret matching best-known bounds, with numerical experiments showing faster convergence and better performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive exploration enhances learning efficiency and regret performance in RL for LQ control.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time
stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and
controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent.
We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively
adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor.
Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations
and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory
approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its
flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the
best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were
previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve
regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based
counterparts.

*Zhihao Zhan, Jianan Zhao, Zhaocheng Zhu, Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of long-context modeling in NLP by improving state-space models (SSMs) with a novel synthetic task (joint recall) and proposing a solution integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient long-context modeling is critical for NLP, but current methods like Transformers and SSMs face scalability or effectiveness issues.

Method: The authors introduce joint recall as a more complex synthetic task, prove SSMs' limitations, and propose HAX, a solution combining SSMs with CDSA.

Result: HAX outperforms SSM baselines and SSMs with context-independent sparse attention (CISA) on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed HAX method effectively bridges the gap between theoretical analysis and practical long-context modeling, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural
language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant
Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While
state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they
struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus
on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We
show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a
model to recall a value associated with a single key without context,
insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.
To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel
synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value
associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove
that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in
sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution
based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which
has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic
computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world
applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key
Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further
tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms
SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention
(CISA).

*Geng Zhang, Yuxuan Han, Yuxuan Lou, Wangbo Zhao, Yiqi Zhang, Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoNE is a novel expert pruning method for Mixture-of-Experts models, replacing redundant experts with lightweight novices to reduce memory overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying MoE-based models incurs high memory costs, and existing pruning methods show suboptimal performance and instability.

Method: MoNE evaluates expert redundancy using access frequency and output variance, pruning low-usage experts and replacing them with lightweight novices.

Result: MoNE outperforms baselines with minimal accuracy loss, improving zero-shot accuracy by up to 3.61 under 50% pruning.

Conclusion: MoNE is an effective and robust method for compressing MoE models, balancing memory efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
by activating only a subset of experts per input token. However, deploying
MoE-based models incurs significant memory overhead due to the need to retain
all experts in memory. While structured pruning is promising to reduce memory
costs, existing methods often show suboptimal performance and unstable
degradation in three dimensions: model architectures, calibration data sources,
and calibration sample sizes. This paper proposes
Mixture-of-Novices-and-Experts (MoNE), a novel expert pruning method that
replaces redundant experts with lightweight novices to achieve effective and
robust model compression. MoNE evaluates expert redundancy based on two
metrics: access frequency and output variance. Experts exhibiting low usage and
stable outputs are pruned and replaced with lightweight novices-unbiased
estimations of their original outputs-minimizing performance degradation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE consistently outperforms baseline
methods with minimal accuracy degradation across the three dimensions,
confirming its effectiveness and robustness. Notably, it improves the average
zero shot accuracy across nine downstream tasks by up to 2.71 under 25\%
pruning ratio and 3.61 under 50\% pruning. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HelixPipe is a pipeline parallelism method for long-sequence transformer training, addressing performance issues with quadratic attention and memory overhead. It introduces attention parallel partition and a two-fold micro batch schedule, achieving better throughput and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipeline parallelisms perform poorly with growing transformer sequence lengths due to quadratic attention computation and high memory overhead.

Method: HelixPipe uses attention parallel partition, a two-fold micro batch schedule, recomputation without attention, and chunked MLP to optimize performance.

Result: HelixPipe outperforms baselines, achieving a 26% speedup for a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 GPUs.

Conclusion: HelixPipe is effective for long-sequence transformer training, offering superior throughput and scalability.

Abstract: As transformer sequence lengths grow, existing pipeline parallelisms incur
suboptimal performance due to the quadratic attention computation and the
substantial memory overhead. To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,
a novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First,
HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention
computations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in
parallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold
first-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap
communication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation
without attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer
sequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages
with longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput
and scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster
configurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\% speedup over baseline methods when
training a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs. Code is available

*Jinfu Fan, Xiaohui Zhong, Kangrui Ren, Jiangnan Li, Linqing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DDMP, a diffusion disambiguation model for partial label learning (PLL), leveraging diffusion models to denoise ambiguous labels and improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguous labels in PLL reduce data quality and hinder accurate classification. The paper aims to address this by using diffusion models to denoise and refine labels.

Method: The DDMP model constructs pseudo-clean labels for initial diffusion training and uses a transition-aware matrix to estimate ground-truth labels, dynamically updating them during diffusion generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DDMP's effectiveness in improving label disambiguation and classification performance in PLL tasks.

Conclusion: DDMP successfully leverages diffusion models for PLL, enhancing label disambiguation and classifier accuracy.

Abstract: Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical
machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning}
(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels
associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of
diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their
potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.
Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the
perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively
refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model
to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the
generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label
for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch
between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model
for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information
between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial
diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to
estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated
during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is
progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage
of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.

*Yujia Yin, Tianyi Qu, Zihao Wang, Yifan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal graph regression (CGR) to address the overlooked challenge of regression tasks in causal graph learning, adapting causal intervention techniques for regression via contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression tasks in graph learning are more challenging and underexplored compared to classification, despite the success of causal graph learning (CGL) in improving generalizability under OOD scenarios.

Method: The authors reshape the handling of confounding effects in CGL for classification, generalize causal intervention techniques to regression using contrastive learning, and validate their approach on graph OOD benchmarks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed CGR method.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends causal graph learning to regression tasks, providing a validated framework and open-source implementation.

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen
to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural
networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical
successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings,
while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are
overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR);
to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL
studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the
predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize
classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a
lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks
validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and
the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for fine-tuning diffusion models in biomolecular design using iterative distillation to optimize for non-differentiable rewards, improving stability and efficiency over RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require diffusion models to optimize for non-differentiable rewards (e.g., physics-based simulation), but RL methods face instability and inefficiency.

Method: Proposes an iterative distillation framework: collects off-policy data, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies, and updates the model via KL divergence minimization.

Result: Outperforms RL-based methods in stability, sample efficiency, and reward optimization across protein, small molecule, and DNA design tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively fine-tunes diffusion models for reward-guided generation, addressing limitations of RL approaches.

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided
generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly
effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world
applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring
optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions
such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.
Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such
objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode
collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative
distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to
optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy
distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates
reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by
minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the
current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence
minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to
existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein,
small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimistic-WS, a method for identifying the best-performing algorithm in multi-task domains using multi-armed bandits, showing improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately and efficiently identify the best algorithm for each sub-task in multi-problem domains, particularly in general game frameworks like GVGAI and Ludii.

Method: Treats the problem as best arm identification in multi-armed bandits, using an optimistic selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) to rank arms by potential regret reduction.

Result: Demonstrates substantial improvement in average simple regret compared to previous best arm identification algorithms.

Conclusion: Optimistic-WS enhances agent evaluation in general game frameworks and other high-runtime multi-task domains.

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the
best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our
approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for
multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each
arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic
selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks
each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We
evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general
game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general
game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent
for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm
identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a
substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This
novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of
agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other
multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle both short-range and long-range dependencies efficiently without quadratic attention cost.

Method: Combines global attention, chunked local attention, and a gated FIFO memory with rotary positional encoding.

Result: Efficient and lightweight model for tasks like dialogue modeling, code completion, and document understanding.

Conclusion: The architecture provides a scalable and modular solution for long-context language tasks.

Abstract: We present a Transformer architecture for long-context language modeling that
combines global attention with two biologically inspired components: chunked
local attention and a gated FIFO memory mechanism. This unified attention block
allows the model to efficiently handle both short-range and long-range
dependencies without increasing attention cost quadratically. The memory module
persistently stores past token representations using a gated update mechanism
inspired by recurrent networks. Rotary positional encoding is applied per
attention head to enable directionally disentangled, scale-invariant positional
signals. The architecture is implemented entirely from scratch in PyTorch, with
no reliance on high-level libraries, enabling transparent and modular
experimentation. Our model offers a lightweight and extensible design for tasks
such as dialogue modeling, code completion, and document understanding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A refined Random Forest classifier dynamically grows trees on informative features, removes redundancy, and improves accuracy over standard RF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Random Forest uses many trees and all features, leading to high costs and redundancy. The goal is to optimize by focusing on informative features and diverse trees.

Method: The model iteratively removes less informative features, grows new trees as needed, and uses correlation-based clustering to eliminate redundant trees.

Result: Experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show improved accuracy compared to standard RF with the same number of trees.

Conclusion: The refined RF classifier is more efficient and accurate by reducing redundancy and focusing on informative features.

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its
robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often
relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference
cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically
only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering
and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest
Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least
informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should
be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees.
The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF
on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets,
including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

*Kiyoung Om, Kyuil Sim, Taeyoung Yun, Hyeongyu Kang, Jinkyoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework for high-dimensional constrained black-box optimization using flow-based models and posterior inference, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional constrained optimization is challenging due to hard-to-find feasible regions and limitations of current methods like BO and generative models.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: training flow-based models for data distribution and surrogate models, then using posterior inference for candidate selection.

Result: Empirically superior performance on synthetic and real-world tasks, addressing multi-modality and scalability issues.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles constrained optimization, leveraging smooth latent spaces for improved performance.

Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints
is a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.
These problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to
hard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have
been developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of
dimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a
promising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from
poor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the
target distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new
framework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.
First, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and
surrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations
with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection
problem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising
candidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.
During posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly
multi-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when
constraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate
this issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the
latent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data
space. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
on various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a backdoor attack framework (PNAct) for Safe Reinforcement Learning, demonstrating its feasibility and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in Safe RL by showing how backdoor attacks can manipulate agents into unsafe actions.

Method: Introduces PNAct, a framework using Positive and Negative Action samples to implant backdoors, with a designed attack algorithm.

Result: Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PNAct in manipulating Safe RL agents.

Conclusion: Highlights risks in Safe RL and proves the feasibility of backdoor attacks, urging further research into defenses.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact
with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe
Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the
reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during
decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions.
First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor
attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that
involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant
backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative
action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the
properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack
framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights
the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of
such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at

### [305] [Exploring Large Action Sets with Hyperspherical Embeddings using von Mises-Fisher Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00518)
*Walid Bendada, Guillaume Salha-Galvan, Romain Hennequin, Théo Bontempelli, Thomas Bouabça, Tristan Cazenave*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vMF-exp is a scalable exploration method for large action sets in RL using hyperspherical embeddings, outperforming Boltzmann Exploration in scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability issues in exploring large action sets, particularly where Boltzmann Exploration fails due to computational inefficiency.

Method: Sample state embeddings using von Mises-Fisher distribution and explore nearest neighbors, enabling scalability to unlimited actions.

Result: Theoretically matches Boltzmann Exploration's exploration probability while being scalable; validated in simulations, real-world data, and a music streaming recommender system.

Conclusion: vMF-exp is a practical, scalable alternative to Boltzmann Exploration for large action sets with hyperspherical embeddings.

Abstract: This paper introduces von Mises-Fisher exploration (vMF-exp), a scalable
method for exploring large action sets in reinforcement learning problems where
hyperspherical embedding vectors represent these actions. vMF-exp involves
initially sampling a state embedding representation using a von Mises-Fisher
distribution, then exploring this representation's nearest neighbors, which
scales to virtually unlimited numbers of candidate actions. We show that, under
theoretical assumptions, vMF-exp asymptotically maintains the same probability
of exploring each action as Boltzmann Exploration (B-exp), a popular
alternative that, nonetheless, suffers from scalability issues as it requires
computing softmax values for each action. Consequently, vMF-exp serves as a
scalable alternative to B-exp for exploring large action sets with
hyperspherical embeddings. Experiments on simulated data, real-world public
data, and the successful large-scale deployment of vMF-exp on the recommender
system of a global music streaming service empirically validate the key
properties of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative pretraining strategy for EHR data using next-visit event prediction, addressing pitfalls in evaluation and demonstrating competitive performance in zero-shot prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of large-scale pretraining in healthcare, particularly for structured EHR data, which remains underexplored.

Method: A novel generative pretraining strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction, with regularization for repeated events.

Result: The model rivals a fully fine-tuned baseline in zero-shot prediction tasks for dementia and knee osteoarthritis incidence.

Conclusion: The approach captures complex clinical dependencies without costly task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting the promise of generative pretraining in healthcare.

Abstract: Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data
types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured
electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining
strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model
learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the
next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction
of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on
predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation
model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when
new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is
evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee
osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals
a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that
our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly
task-specific fine-tuning.

### [307] [Quantum Circuit Structure Optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00589)
*Seok Bin Son, Joongheon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRL-NAS algorithm optimizes PQC structures in quantum reinforcement learning, outperforming fixed-circuit QRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional QRL uses fixed PQC structures without verifying optimality, limiting efficiency.

Method: Integrates quantum neural architecture search (QNAS) to optimize PQC structures in QRL.

Result: QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than fixed-circuit QRL, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: QRL-NAS enhances QRL by optimizing PQC structures, offering practical utility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through
environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency
due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition
and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of
high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural
networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as
the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear
transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical
neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures
based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper
proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search
(QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that
QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its
effectiveness and practical utility.

### [308] [Residual Reward Models for Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00611)
*Chenyang Cao, Miguel Rogel-García, Mohamed Nabail, Xueqian Wang, Nicholas Rhinehart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Residual Reward Model (RRM) to improve Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) by combining prior knowledge with learned rewards, enhancing performance and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PbRL suffers from slow convergence due to reward model training challenges. Existing methods struggle with optimization when using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning.

Method: The RRM splits the true reward into a prior reward (pre-defined or from IRL) and a learned reward (trained with preferences). State-based and image-based RRM versions are introduced and tested on Meta-World tasks and a real robot.

Result: RRM substantially improves PbRL performance, works with various prior rewards, and accelerates policy learning, achieving success in fewer steps than baselines.

Conclusion: RRM effectively leverages prior knowledge to enhance PbRL, demonstrating superior performance in simulated and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn
high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to
specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can
suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward
model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and
fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,
using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose
challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to
effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM
assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two
parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term
available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward
function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce
state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks
in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method
substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method
achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior
rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a
negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka
Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It
significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving
success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at

### [309] [Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00647)
*André Ribeiro, Ana Luiza Tenório, Juan Belieni, Amauri H. Souza, Diego Mesquita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sheaf diffusion lacks cooperative behavior due to missing message directionality. The paper introduces directed cellular sheaves and proposes Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs), which outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of sheaf diffusion in achieving cooperative behavior, which is crucial for flexible information diffusion in graph representation learning.

Method: Introduces cellular sheaves over directed graphs, characterizes their Laplacians, and proposes CSNNs to enable cooperative behavior.

Result: CSNNs outperform prior methods in sheaf diffusion and cooperative graph neural networks, with theoretical support for selective attention and mitigation of oversquashing.

Conclusion: Directed cellular sheaves and CSNNs successfully enable cooperative behavior in sheaf diffusion, improving performance and addressing key limitations.

Abstract: Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph
representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data
and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been
proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by
allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information
from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of
exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to
this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods
fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality.
To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over
directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We
leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs).
Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows
nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring
all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments
show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on
sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.

*Yilun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cognitive Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, applying Cognitive Load Theory to optimize LLM inference, reducing token usage by up to 45% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of LLM inference by leveraging cognitive theory for optimization, moving beyond heuristic-based methods.

Method: Develops CLAI framework with quantifiable metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$, $GCL_{LLM}$) and two implementations: CLAI-Prompt (zero-shot) and CLAI-Tune (fine-tuned).

Result: Achieves up to 45% reduction in token consumption while maintaining accuracy; CLAI-Tune shows emergent problem decomposition skills.

Conclusion: Emulating human cognitive strategies can enhance LLM efficiency and capability, offering a sustainable path for AI deployment.

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.
While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly
based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a
guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper
aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive
Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize
the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and
Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,
and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive
economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem
($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically
allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two
implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM
through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a
fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive
economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context
question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant
reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose
difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work
demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we
can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

### [311] [GANs Secretly Perform Approximate Bayesian Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00651)
*Maurizio Filippone, Marius P. Linhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper interprets GANs as probabilistic generative models, linking them to Bayesian neural networks, and proposes regularization strategies based on marginal likelihood optimization for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of GAN optimization and overfitting by reinterpreting GANs as probabilistic models and leveraging Bayesian principles.

Method: Interprets GANs as Bayesian neural networks with partial stochasticity, establishes universal approximation conditions, and optimizes marginal likelihood proxies for regularization.

Result: Proposed strategies improve GAN performance and provide insights into regularization techniques.

Conclusion: The probabilistic interpretation and Bayesian-inspired strategies enhance GAN optimization and generalization, offering a deeper understanding of regularization.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

*Hans van Gorp, Davide Belli, Amir Jalalirad, Bence Major*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) is proposed to integrate road network data with GNSS measurements, reducing positioning errors by 29% in dense urban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS accuracy is compromised in dense urban environments due to multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can mitigate these issues, but existing methods lack flexibility and robustness.

Method: A TGNN is trained to predict the correct road segment and its uncertainty, integrating this into a Kalman Filter (KF) for improved positioning.

Result: The approach reduces positioning error by 29% in challenging scenarios compared to GNSS-only KF.

Conclusion: This is the first deep learning-based method combining road network data and GNSS measurements for accurate user positioning.

Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning
information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often
compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be
used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a
positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either
limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with
little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph
Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN
is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty
to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach
with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29%
decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only
KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based
approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine
the user position on Earth.

*Duc Cao-Dinh, Khai Le-Duc, Anh Dao, Bach Phan Tat, Chris Ngo, Duy M. H. Nguyen, Nguyen X. Khanh, Thanh Nguyen-Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Audio-3DVG integrates audio and spatial info for 3D visual grounding, outperforming prior methods by decomposing the task into object mention detection and audio-guided attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks exploration of spoken language in 3DVG. Advances in ASR and speech representation learning motivate leveraging audio for enhanced grounding.

Method: Decomposes task into Object Mention Detection (multi-label classification) and Audio-Guided Attention (captures object-speech interactions). Uses synthesized audio from standard datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in audio-based grounding and competes with text-based methods.

Conclusion: Audio-3DVG shows promise for integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point
clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

*Philipp Vaeth, Dibyanshu Kumar, Benjamin Paassen, Magda Gregorová*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extending classifier guidance to non-robust classifiers by addressing noise sensitivity and stabilizing gradients, improving conditional sampling in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current classifier guidance methods are limited to robust classifiers trained on diffusion noise, restricting their applicability. This work aims to enable general classifiers for guidance.

Method: Analyzes noise sensitivity of classifiers, proposes using one-step denoised predictions and stabilization techniques (e.g., exponential moving averages) to improve guidance stability.

Result: Non-robust classifiers degrade under noise, but the proposed method stabilizes guidance while preserving sample diversity and visual quality.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the use of classifiers in guidance, advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models.

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a
given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain
class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust
classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion
forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,
non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the
sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion
process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set
and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal
that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under
noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions
and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization
methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while
maintaining sample diversity and visual quality. This work contributes to
advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models, enabling a
broader range of classifiers to be used as guidance classifiers.

### [315] [A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00695)
*Daniel Pfrommer, Max Simchowitz, Ali Jadbabaie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework linking RL-style value functions to incremental stability, distinct from traditional Lyapunov methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between RL value functions and control theory stability analysis, which traditionally relies on Lyapunov functions.

Method: Develops an equivalence between incremental input-to-state stability (δISS) and the regularity of RL-style value functions using Hölder-continuous rewards.

Result: Shows RL-style value functions can certify stability without relying on Lyapunov functions.

Conclusion: The regularity of RL value functions offers a new perspective on stability, diverging from classical Lyapunov-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing
Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using
rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with
Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement
learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a
Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides.
Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov
certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental
input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the
regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a
H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity
of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be
understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based
approach to certifying stability in control theory.

*Chong Zhang, Xichao Liu, Yibing Zhan, Dapeng Tao, Jun Ni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCAWaveNet, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, improves significant wave height (SWH) retrieval by leveraging cross-channel interactions, outperforming existing models with reduced RMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for SWH retrieval lack effective cross-channel information interaction, limiting performance.

Method: SCAWaveNet models features from each channel as independent attention heads, fusing spatial and channel-wise information, and uses a lightweight attention mechanism for auxiliary parameters.

Result: SCAWaveNet achieves RMSE of 0.438 m (ERA5) and 0.432 m (NDBC), reducing RMSE by 3.52% and 5.47% respectively compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SCAWaveNet demonstrates superior performance in SWH retrieval by effectively utilizing cross-channel interactions, offering a promising approach for future applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in spaceborne GNSS missions have produced extensive
global datasets, providing a robust basis for deep learning-based significant
wave height (SWH) retrieval. While existing deep learning models predominantly
utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt
single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the
benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address
this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely
SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each
channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the
fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a
lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial
and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and
channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using
four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves
an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE
reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the
average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC
buoy observations. The code is available at

Motivation: To investigate whether benchmark gains in LLMs reflect actual reasoning improvements or just longer, ineffective chains of thought.

Method: Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024 math benchmark to analyze their reasoning behavior.

Result: Models often disregard correct solutions, generate unnecessary steps, and reach incorrect conclusions, highlighting limitations in integrating corrective information.

Conclusion: The findings reveal critical challenges in achieving robust and interpretable reasoning in LLMs, questioning their current effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
recently achieved impressive results on reasoning benchmarks. Yet, growing
evidence shows that these models often generate longer but ineffective chains
of thought (CoTs), calling into question whether benchmark gains reflect real
reasoning improvements. We present new evidence of overthinking, where models
disregard correct solutions even when explicitly provided, instead continuing
to generate unnecessary reasoning steps that often lead to incorrect
conclusions. Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024
math benchmark reveal critical limitations in these models ability to integrate
corrective information, posing new challenges for achieving robust and

*Stefan Haas, Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces new measures for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal classification, outperforming existing methods in error and OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ordinal classification is common in critical fields like medicine and finance, but existing uncertainty measures focus on nominal classification and regression, leaving a gap for ordinal cases.

Method: The authors propose entropy- and variance-based measures for ordinal classification by reducing them to binary cases, tested on benchmark datasets using gradient-boosted trees and multi-layer perceptrons.

Result: The new measures outperform standard methods in error detection (misclassification rates, mean absolute error) and show competitive OOD detection performance.

Conclusion: The ordinal nature of classification problems is crucial for accurate uncertainty assessment, and the proposed measures effectively address this need.

Abstract: Ordinal classification problems, where labels exhibit a natural order, are
prevalent in high-stakes fields such as medicine and finance. Accurate
uncertainty quantification, including the decomposition into aleatoric
(inherent variability) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) components, is crucial
for reliable decision-making. However, existing research has primarily focused
on nominal classification and regression. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal
classification, which is based on a suitable reduction to (entropy- and
variance-based) measures for the binary case. These measures effectively
capture the trade-off in ordinal classification between exact hit-rate and
minimial error distances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
various tabular ordinal benchmark datasets using ensembles of gradient-boosted
trees and multi-layer perceptrons for approximate Bayesian inference. Our
method significantly outperforms standard and label-wise entropy and
variance-based measures in error detection, as indicated by misclassification
rates and mean absolute error. Additionally, the ordinal measures show
competitive performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering the ordinal nature of classification
problems when assessing uncertainty.

*Arthur Thuy, Ekaterina Loginova, Dries F. Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks QDE methods, introduces OrderedLogitNN, and proposes balanced DRPS for fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing neglect of ordinality and class imbalance in QDE, and improving evaluation metrics.

Method: Benchmarks discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression; introduces OrderedLogitNN and balanced DRPS.

Result: OrderedLogitNN outperforms on complex tasks; balanced DRPS proves robust.

Conclusion: Balanced DRPS and OrderedLogitNN provide a principled foundation for future QDE research.

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

TL;DR: The study evaluates 27 open-source and 2 proprietary LLMs to identify faulty components from ambiguous user reports, achieving an F1-score of 0.76. Three models (mistral-small-24b-instruct, llama-3.2-1b-instruct, gemma-2-2b-it) balance performance and efficiency for end-user devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating fault identification from ambiguous user reports to improve testing and user experience.

Method: Evaluated 27 open-source and 2 proprietary LLMs using four prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, CoT+Few-Shot) across 98,948 inferences.

Result: Achieved F1-score up to 0.76; identified three efficient models suitable for end-user devices.

Conclusion: Smaller models like llama-3.2-1b-instruct and gemma-2-2b-it offer competitive performance with lower resource usage, making them practical for deployment.

Abstract: Computer manufacturers offer platforms for users to describe device faults
using textual reports such as "My screen is flickering". Identifying the faulty
component from the report is essential for automating tests and improving user

this task challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
addressing such issues. This study evaluates 27 open-source models (1B-72B

Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and CoT+Few-Shot (CoT+FS). We conducted
98,948 inferences, processing over 51 million input tokens and generating 13
million output tokens. We achieve f1-score up to 0.76. Results show that three

gemma-2-2b-it, that offer competitive performance with lower VRAM usage,
enabling efficient inference on end-user devices as modern laptops or

### [321] [A Probabilistic Approach to Wildfire Spread Prediction Using a Denoising Diffusion Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00761)
*Wenbo Yu, Anirbit Ghosh, Tobias Sebastian Finn, Rossella Arcucci, Marc Bocquet, Sibo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A denoising diffusion model is introduced to predict wildfire spread, generating multiple possible scenarios to account for uncertainty, unlike traditional deterministic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfire spread prediction is challenging due to fire's unpredictability and environmental variability. Existing models often fail to represent uncertainty.

Method: The study uses a denoising diffusion model, an AI framework that simulates fire spread as a range of possible outcomes, producing ensemble forecasts.

Result: The model generates physically meaningful distributions of fire spread scenarios, improving reliability over single-outcome predictions.

Conclusion: This approach enhances wildfire behavior prediction, aiding risk assessment and response planning with smarter, faster tools.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, computers can now simulate
realistic and complex natural processes. We apply this capability to predict
how wildfires spread, a task made difficult by the unpredictable nature of fire
and the variety of environmental conditions it depends on. In this study, We
present the first denoising diffusion model for predicting wildfire spread, a
new kind of AI framework that learns to simulate fires not just as one fixed
outcome, but as a range of possible scenarios. By doing so, it accounts for the
inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics, a feature that traditional models
typically fail to represent. Unlike deterministic approaches that generate a
single prediction, our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect
physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. This
technology could help us develop smarter, faster, and more reliable tools for
anticipating wildfire behavior, aiding decision-makers in fire risk assessment
and response planning.

*Ruihan Xu, Haokui Zhang, Yaowei Wang, Wei Zeng, Shiliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural predictor combining GNNs and transformers addresses limitations of both by focusing on sibling nodes in neural architecture topology, achieving strong accuracy and latency prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient neural network design and deployment drives the development of better predictors for attributes like accuracy and latency, overcoming the shortcomings of existing GNNs and transformers.

Method: Proposes a hybrid predictor using GNNs and transformers, introducing a sibling-aware token mixer and a bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network for enhanced topology learning.

Result: The approach consistently delivers strong performance in accuracy and latency prediction, offering insights for DAG topology learning.

Conclusion: The novel predictor effectively leverages sibling nodes and hybrid techniques, providing a robust solution for neural architecture attribute prediction.

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and
deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as
accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers
have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However,
each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to
represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization
when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink
neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while
overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging
the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We
introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer
named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach
consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency
prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to enhance Reinforcement Learning (RL) performance in industrial sorting tasks by generating expert demonstrations for RL agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL's broader industrial use is limited by sample inefficiency and unstable learning. This study aims to improve RL performance by integrating GA-generated demonstrations.

Method: GA-generated expert demonstrations are fed into a DQN replay buffer and used as warm-start trajectories for PPO agents. Comparisons are made with rule-based heuristics and brute-force optimization.

Result: GA-derived demonstrations significantly boost RL performance, with PPO agents achieving superior cumulative rewards when initialized with GA data.

Conclusion: Hybrid learning paradigms combining heuristic search (GAs) and data-driven RL show promise for real-world applications, with the framework made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in certain
real-world industrial applications, yet its broader deployment remains limited
by inherent challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable learning
dynamics. This study investigates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs)
as a mechanism for improving RL performance in an industrially inspired sorting
environment. We propose a novel approach in which GA-generated expert
demonstrations are used to enhance policy learning. These demonstrations are
incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based
learning and utilized as warm-start trajectories for Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments
compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force
optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations
significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with
GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the
potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods
complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and
enables further research into adaptive RL strategies for real-world
applications.

*Rishal Aggrwal, Jacky Chen, Nicholas M. Boffi, David Ryan Koes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to efficiently sample from the Boltzmann distribution using energy-based models and stochastic interpolants, avoiding costly Jacobian computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from the Boltzmann distribution is computationally expensive for large molecular systems due to the need for costly Jacobian calculations.

Method: The method learns the likelihood of the generated distribution using an energy-based model trained with noise contrastive estimation and score matching, combined with stochastic interpolants for annealing.

Result: The approach achieves comparable free energy profiles and distributions to exact likelihood methods, with significant speedup in estimating free energy differences.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently approximates the Boltzmann distribution, offering a practical solution for large molecular systems.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy
function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules.
Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows
that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to
match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining
likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it
impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning
the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained
with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic
interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we
combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function.
On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free
energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with
exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between
metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses quantum-accelerated machine learning to improve HIV cluster detection and forecasting, outperforming classical methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex HIV epidemiological data requires advanced computational methods for accurate analysis and intervention planning.

Method: Combined quantum (QAOA, hybrid neural networks, Bayesian networks) and classical (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) techniques to analyze HIV data.

Result: Quantum methods achieved 92-94% accuracy, identified housing instability as a key factor, and outperformed classical approaches.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced methods offer precise, efficient HIV surveillance and insights for targeted interventions and resource allocation.

Abstract: HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced
computation for accurate cluster detection and forecasting. We employed
quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code
level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared
classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV
prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal
links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved
92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical
algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted
HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart.
Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV
cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable
influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and
efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways.
This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for
PrEP, and address structural inequities fueling HIV transmission.

### [326] [Aligning Learning and Endogenous Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00851)
*Rares Cristian, Pavithra Harsha, Georgia Perakis, Brian Quanz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end ML method for decision-making under endogenous uncertainty, including a robust optimization variant and a new two-stage stochastic optimization framework, outperforming existing methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of biased observations in decision-making due to endogenous factors (e.g., prices affecting demand) and the lack of counterfactual information necessitates learning-aware ML models.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end ML training method under endogenous uncertainty, a robust optimization variant with uncertainty sets, and a two-stage stochastic optimization framework for information-gathering and decision-making.

Result: The robust approach guarantees near-optimal decisions with high probability, and computational experiments show improved performance over existing methods in pricing and inventory problems.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses endogenous uncertainty and introduces novel optimization problems, demonstrating superior performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Many of the observations we make are biased by our decisions. For instance,
the demand of items is impacted by the prices set, and online checkout choices
are influenced by the assortments presented. The challenge in decision-making
under this setting is the lack of counterfactual information, and the need to
learn it instead. We introduce an end-to-end method under endogenous
uncertainty to train ML models to be aware of their downstream, enabling their
effective use in the decision-making stage. We further introduce a robust
optimization variant that accounts for uncertainty in ML models -- specifically
by constructing uncertainty sets over the space of ML models and optimizing
actions to protect against worst-case predictions. We prove guarantees that
this robust approach can capture near-optimal decisions with high probability
as a function of data. Besides this, we also introduce a new class of two-stage
stochastic optimization problems to the end-to-end learning framework that can
now be addressed through our framework. Here, the first stage is an
information-gathering problem to decide which random variable to poll and gain
information about before making a second-stage decision based off of it. We
present several computational experiments for pricing and inventory
assortment/recommendation problems. We compare against existing methods in
online learning/bandits/offline reinforcement learning and show our approach
has consistent improved performance over these. Just as in the endogenous
setting, the model's prediction also depends on the first-stage decision made.
While this decision does not affect the random variable in this setting, it
does affect the correct point forecast that should be made.

### [327] [Machine Learning-based Early Detection of Potato Sprouting Using Electrophysiological Signals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00862)
*Davide Andreoletti, Aris Marcolongo, Natasa Sarafijanovic Djukic, Julien Roulet, Stefano Billeter, Andrzej Kurenda, Margot Visse-Mansiaux, Brice Dupuis, Carrol Annette Plummer, Beatrice Paoli, Omran Ayoub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using electrophysiological signals for early prediction of potato sprouting, addressing the need for proactive storage management post-CIPC ban.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ban on CIPC and the limitations of visual sprouting detection necessitate a reliable early prediction method to optimize storage and reduce costs.

Method: Proposes an ML-based approach using electrophysiological signals, preprocessing, wavelet domain feature extraction, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Demonstrates promising performance in early sprouting detection, with accurate day predictions for some potatoes and acceptable average error.

Conclusion: While results are promising, further refinements are needed to minimize prediction errors, especially in reducing maximum deviations.

Abstract: Accurately predicting potato sprouting before the emergence of any visual
signs is critical for effective storage management, as sprouting degrades both
the commercial and nutritional value of tubers. Effective forecasting allows
for the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing
waste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the
ban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to
health and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of
significantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily
rely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological
changes have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A
reliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely
intervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies,
where early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In
this work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To
this end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables
early prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals
recorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the
recorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and
trains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we
incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection
of potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a
subset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all
potatoes. Despite promising results, further refinements are necessary to
minimize prediction errors, particularly in reducing the maximum observed
deviations.

*Carlos Vonessen, Charles Harris, Miruna Cretu, Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TABASCO is a non-equivariant transformer model for 3D molecular generation that simplifies architecture, improves speed, and achieves state-of-the-art validity without hard-coded symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D molecular generation models struggle with physical plausibility despite strong inductive biases. TABASCO aims to relax these assumptions for better performance and simplicity.

Method: TABASCO uses a standard non-equivariant transformer, treats atoms as sequences, and reconstructs bonds deterministically post-generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art validity on GEOM-Drugs, 10x faster inference than baselines, and exhibits emergent rotational equivariance.

Conclusion: TABASCO provides a minimalist, high-throughput approach for specialized tasks like drug design, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for 3D molecular generation are based on significant
inductive biases, SE(3), permutation equivariance to respect symmetry and graph
message-passing networks to capture local chemistry, yet the generated
molecules still struggle with physical plausibility. We introduce TABASCO which
relaxes these assumptions: The model has a standard non-equivariant transformer
architecture, treats atoms in a molecule as sequences and reconstructs bonds
deterministically after generation. The absence of equivariant layers and
message passing allows us to significantly simplify the model architecture and
scale data throughput. On the GEOM-Drugs benchmark TABASCO achieves
state-of-the-art PoseBusters validity and delivers inference roughly 10x faster
than the strongest baseline, while exhibiting emergent rotational equivariance
despite symmetry not being hard-coded. Our work offers a blueprint for training
minimalist, high-throughput generative models suited to specialised tasks such
as structure- and pharmacophore-based drug design. We provide a link to our
implementation at github.com/carlosinator/tabasco.

*Dang Qua Nguyen, Morteza Hashemi, Erik Perrins, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, David J. Love, Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) for federated learning (FL) to address privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity, ensuring differential privacy and minimal quantization error while improving learning utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces challenges like privacy risks from unprotected model updates and reduced utility due to quantization heterogeneity. Existing solutions address only one issue, so the paper aims to tackle both simultaneously.

Method: Introduces a stochastic quantizer (SQ) for differential privacy and minimal quantization error, alongside a cluster size optimization and linear fusion technique for accurate model aggregation.

Result: Numerical simulations show the approach outperforms the conventional LaplaceSQ-FL in privacy protection and learning utility.

Conclusion: The proposed SQ and optimization techniques effectively enhance FL by balancing privacy and utility under quantization heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed
machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across
multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its
advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from
the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)
and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model
quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically
addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility
under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.
In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a
privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different
quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we
introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously
achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the
proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To
address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization
technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation
accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms
of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional
LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

*Taeyoun Kim, Fahim Tajwar, Aditi Raghunathan, Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TARS, a reinforcement learning method to train LLMs for adaptive reasoning on safety, improving robustness against harmful requests and jailbreaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM robustness against safety vulnerabilities by adaptively allocating compute during reasoning, addressing issues like refusal shortcuts and reasoning degeneration.

Method: TARS uses RL with chain-of-thought traces and a balanced reward signal, incorporating a warmstart SFT stage, diverse prompts, and a specific reward function.

Result: TARS-trained models show adaptive compute use, better safety-refusal trade-offs, and improved robustness against attacks like GCG and PAIR.

Conclusion: TARS provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs to handle harmful requests by adaptive reasoning per prompt.

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,
harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many
refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning
capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive
behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better
safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish
between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box
(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an
effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful
requests by reasoning per prompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of MPNNs' generalization in node- and link-level tasks is limited, with existing studies relying on unrealistic assumptions and neglecting graph structure.

Method: A unified framework is proposed to analyze MPNN generalization, incorporating diverse architectural parameters, loss functions, and graph structure influence.

Result: Empirical studies support theoretical insights, enhancing understanding of MPNNs' generalization in inductive and transductive settings.

Conclusion: The framework advances MPNN generalization analysis, applicable beyond graphs to other classification tasks, and provides deeper insights into their capabilities.

Abstract: Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link
prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has
led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in
practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains
poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in
graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and
link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@
assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and
assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the
influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to
analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive
node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural
parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure.
Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond
graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting.
Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our
understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.

TL;DR: A unified framework for accelerating deep neural network training via stochastic gradient descent, using Lyapunov exponents to distinguish convergence from stabilization, and introducing ghost output nodes to bypass poor basins early on.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the training of deep neural networks by distinguishing genuine convergence from stabilization near saddle points and enabling the optimizer to bypass poor basins.

Method: Analyze the geometric landscape of the objective function, introduce a diagnostic using Lyapunov exponents, and extend classifiers with ghost output nodes for extra descent directions.

Result: The ghost extension reduces approximation error, collapses after convergence, and preserves the original model's behavior while accelerating early training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a principled way to enhance early-stage trainability without compromising asymptotic performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an
ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework
for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via
stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the
objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of
the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence
toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle
points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers
that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent
directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable
the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show
that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after
sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's
invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in
the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while
the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these
results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates
early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

TL;DR: SEPAL is a scalable embedding propagation algorithm for large knowledge graphs, designed to improve downstream task performance by optimizing embeddings on a core set of entities and propagating them globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embedding methods for knowledge graphs are limited by their focus on link prediction and scalability issues with large graphs.

Method: SEPAL optimizes embeddings on a small core of entities and propagates them globally via message passing, addressing scalability and downstream task performance.

Result: SEPAL outperforms previous methods on 46 downstream tasks and scales efficiently on large graphs using commodity hardware.

Conclusion: SEPAL provides a scalable and effective solution for embedding large knowledge graphs, enhancing performance in downstream applications.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large
knowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to
distill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream
applications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:
they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive
learning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory
limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation
ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality
embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce
global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of
entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message
passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream
machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms
previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base
embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeCO introduces a Zero Communication Overhead sequence parallelism method for linear attention models, achieving near-linear scalability and significant speedups for long sequence training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods cause substantial communication overhead, becoming a bottleneck for efficient processing of ultra-long sequences in LLMs.

Method: ZeCO uses All-Scan, a new collective communication primitive, to eliminate communication overhead by providing each SP rank with the required initial operator state.

Result: ZeCO achieves a 60% speedup on 256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length compared to the current SOTA SP method.

Conclusion: ZeCO enables efficient training of next-generation LLMs on previously intractable sequence lengths.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language
Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient
processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing
Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads
across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication
overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)
sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to
overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for
long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length
across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an
16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new
collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with
precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal
communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.
Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only
negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication
costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that
All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on
256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\% speedup compared to
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a
clear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously
intractable sequence lengths.

*Aochuan Chen, Jiashun Cheng, Zijing Liu, Ziqi Gao, Fugee Tsung, Yu Li, Jia Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C³A (Circular Convolution Adaptation) outperforms LoRA in fine-tuning large models by achieving high-rank adaptation while maintaining computational and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's low-rank characteristic may limit performance, and existing variants often sacrifice efficiency. C³A aims to enhance performance without compromising efficiency.

Method: Proposes C³A, which uses circular convolution for high-rank adaptation, improving performance while retaining computational and memory efficiency.

Result: C³A consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants in various fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: C³A offers a superior alternative to LoRA, balancing high-rank adaptation with efficiency.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large
foundation models, leveraging low-rank matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$
to represent weight changes (i.e., $\Delta \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{B}
\mathbf{A}$). This method reduces trainable parameters and mitigates heavy
memory consumption associated with full delta matrices by sequentially
multiplying $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with the activation. Despite its
success, the intrinsic low-rank characteristic may limit its performance.
Although several variants have been proposed to address this issue, they often
overlook the crucial computational and memory efficiency brought by LoRA. In
this paper, we propose Circular Convolution Adaptation (C$^3$A), which not only
achieves high-rank adaptation with enhanced performance but also excels in both
computational power and memory utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that C$^3$A consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across various
fine-tuning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares dynamic few-shot example selection and automatic prompt optimization for detecting emission reduction goals in corporate reports, finding the latter superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring companies' climate change progress by detecting emission reduction goals in reports is crucial.

Method: Compares dynamic few-shot example selection and automatic prompt optimization using a dataset of 769 climate-related passages.

Result: Automatic prompt optimization outperforms dynamic few-shot selection, with combined methods offering limited benefits.

Conclusion: Optimized prompts effectively capture the complexities of emission goal extraction, making them the preferred approach.

Abstract: We address the detection of emission reduction goals in corporate reports, an
important task for monitoring companies' progress in addressing climate change.
Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form
of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two
strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the
automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a
public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports
indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while
combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results
indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the
targeted emission goal extraction task.

### [339] [Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18232)
*Mingkuan Feng, Jinyang Wu, Siyuan Liu, Shuai Zhang, Ruihan Jin, Feihu Che, Pengpeng Shao, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRSP is a novel two-stage regularization-based pruning method for LLMs that avoids knowledge loss and retraining, outperforming traditional structured pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to their size. Traditional pruning methods cause knowledge loss and require retraining.

Method: TRSP uses two-stage regularization: first, learnable weights with ℓ1-norm regularization; second, regularization on layer output differences to shift knowledge.

Result: TRSP retains more knowledge, preserves performance, and outperforms other pruning methods without retraining, enabling efficient LLM deployment.

Conclusion: TRSP is an effective pruning solution for LLMs, offering performance preservation and acceleration without retraining.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is largely hindered by their
large number of parameters. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising
solution. Prior structured pruning methods directly remove unimportant
parameters based on certain metrics, which often causes knowledge loss and
necessitates extensive retraining. To overcome this, we introduce a novel
pruning method TRSP: Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for
LLMs. Specifically, we multiply the output of each transformer layer by an
initial learnable weight and iteratively learn these weights by adding their
$\ell_1$-norm as a regularization term to the loss function, serving as the
first-stage regularization. Subsequently, we apply additional regularization to
the difference between the output and input of layers with smaller weights,
encouraging the shift of knowledge to the preserved layers. This serves as the
second-stage regularization. TRSP retains more knowledge and better preserves
model performance than direct parameter elimination. Through extensive
experimentation we show that TRSP outperforms strong layer-wise structured
pruning methods without requiring retraining. As a layer-wise pruning method,
it delivers notable end-to-end acceleration, making it a promising solution for
efficient LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLR-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents in open-ended ML research, featuring tasks, an automated evaluation framework (MLR-Judge), and a modular agent (MLR-Agent). It highlights LLMs' strengths in idea generation and paper writing but reveals coding agents' reliability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for assessing AI agents' capabilities in scientific research, particularly in open-ended ML tasks.

Method: MLR-Bench includes 201 research tasks, MLR-Judge for automated evaluation, and MLR-Agent for task completion. It evaluates agents across idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing.

Result: LLMs excel in idea generation and paper writing, but coding agents often produce unreliable results (80% failure rate). MLR-Judge aligns well with human reviewers.

Conclusion: MLR-Bench is a scalable tool for improving AI research agents, emphasizing the need for reliability in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to
drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning
research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks
sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2)
MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with
carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3)
MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks
through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation,
and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these
distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research
paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced
coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent
ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in
80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental
results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate
MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert
reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation.
We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve
AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

### [341] [Junk DNA Hypothesis: Pruning Small Pre-Trained Weights Irreversibly and Monotonically Impairs "Difficult" Downstream Tasks in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02277)
*Lu Yin, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Souvik Kundu, Zhangyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the belief that small-magnitude weights in LLMs are redundant, showing they encode vital knowledge for difficult tasks, and pruning them causes performance drops. Quantization doesn't show the same effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the common assumption that pruning small-magnitude weights in LLMs is harmless, revealing their importance for difficult tasks.

Method: Analyzes pruning effects on downstream tasks, introduces metrics for task difficulty, and compares with quantization.

Result: Pruning small weights leads to performance drops in difficult tasks, while quantization doesn't show the same effect.

Conclusion: Small-magnitude weights are crucial for difficult tasks, supporting the 'Junk DNA Hypothesis' that they aren't redundant.

Abstract: We present Junk DNA Hypothesis by adopting a novel task-centric angle for the
pre-trained weights of large language models (LLMs). It has been believed that
weights in LLMs contain significant redundancy, leading to the conception that
a considerable chunk of the parameters can be removed by pruning without
compromising performance. Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a
counter-argument: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode
vital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested
as the monotonic relationship between the performance drop of downstream tasks
across the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by
magnitude. Moreover, we reveal that these seemingly inconsequential weights can
result in irreparable loss of knowledge and performance degradation in
difficult tasks, even when downstream continual training is allowed.
Interestingly, our evaluations show that the other popular compression, namely
quantization, fails to exhibit similar monotonic effect and does not as
convincingly disentangle this task-difficulty information. To study formally,
we introduce several quantifiable metrics to gauge the downstream task
difficulty: (1) within the same task category, and (2) across different task
categories. Our extensive experiments substantiate the Junk DNA Hypothesis
across a diverse range of model sizes, tasks, datasets, and even pruning
methods. Codes are available at:

*Sheldon C. Ebron, Meiying Zhang, Kan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedTruth is a solution for detecting malicious model updates in Federated Learning without needing a benign root dataset or assuming data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against model poisoning attacks in FL rely on impractical assumptions like benign root datasets or may exclude underrepresented data contributions.

Method: FedTruth dynamically estimates the ground-truth model update (global model update) among all updates using dynamic aggregation weights, without specific assumptions on data distribution.

Result: FedTruth effectively reduces the impact of poisoned model updates in both Byzantine and backdoor attacks and is efficient in large-scale FL systems.

Conclusion: FedTruth provides a practical and efficient defense against model poisoning attacks in FL, accommodating all benign clients' contributions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning
models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, the
federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model
by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect
malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between
each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such
\textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign
root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median
as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets
are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate
contributions from these underrepresented datasets.
  In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend
against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model
update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model
updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have
specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to
a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions
from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce
the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor
attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precipitation nowcasting by integrating physics-informed methods with deep learning for better accuracy and adaptability.

Method: LUPIN uses a U-Net for advection motion fields, a semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an advection-free U-Net for precipitation dynamics, enabling end-to-end training.

Result: LUPIN matches or exceeds benchmark performance in extreme event case studies, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The success of LUPIN paves the way for Lagrangian machine learning models in nowcasting and related fields.

Abstract: This paper presents a convolutional neural network model for precipitation
nowcasting that combines data-driven learning with physics-informed domain
knowledge. We propose LUPIN, a Lagrangian Double U-Net for Physics-Informed
Nowcasting, that draws from existing extrapolation-based nowcasting methods. It
consists of a U-Net that dynamically produces mesoscale advection motion
fields, a differentiable semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an
advection-free U-Net capturing the growth and decay of precipitation over time.
Using our approach, we successfully implement the Lagrangian convolutional
neural network for precipitation nowcasting in a fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated manner. This allows for end-to-end training and inference,
including the data-driven Lagrangian coordinate system transformation of the
data at runtime. We evaluate the model and compare it with other related
AI-based models both quantitatively and qualitatively in an extreme event case
study. Based on our evaluation, LUPIN matches and even exceeds the performance
of the chosen benchmarks, opening the door for other Lagrangian machine
learning models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an energy-constrained diffusion model inspired by physical systems, unifying MPNNs under a single framework and introducing DIFFormer, a new model with promising performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning representations for structured data with geometries, leveraging physical system-inspired diffusion models to unify and improve neural architectures like MPNNs.

Method: Develops an energy-constrained diffusion model, linking diffusion operators to energy functions, and derives propagation layers for MPNNs. Introduces DIFFormer, a diffusion-inspired Transformer.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on datasets with observed, partially observed, or unobserved structures, validating the framework's versatility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework unifies MPNNs and introduces DIFFormer, offering a principled approach for learning structured data representations with broad applicability.

Abstract: Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (e.g.,
observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing
neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In
this paper, inspired by physical systems, we propose an energy-constrained
diffusion model, which integrates the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds
with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the
diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions
implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference
iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the
propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent
structures. This leads to a unified mathematical framework for common neural
architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its
special case), including MLPs, GNNs, and Transformers. Building on these
insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed
diffusion-inspired Transformers (DIFFormer), whose global attention layers are
derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across
diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and
physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising
performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph),
partially observed, or entirely unobserved.

### [345] [Neural Networks Generalize on Low Complexity Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12446)
*Sourav Chatterjee, Timothy Sudijono*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low-complexity data, demonstrated via a simple programming language and MDL principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks generalize on structured, low-complexity data and whether MDL-based networks can discover underlying patterns (e.g., primality) without explicit design.

Method: Define a simple programming language and MDL for networks. Train MDL networks to interpolate i.i.d. data (e.g., primality labels) and evaluate generalization.

Result: MDL networks generalize well, e.g., accurately predict primality with error probability $1-O((\ln N)/n)$. Also handles noisy data, showing tempered overfitting.

Conclusion: MDL-based neural networks can effectively generalize on low-complexity tasks, even discovering patterns like primality without explicit training.

Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on
low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a
simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward
neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability.
We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description
length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational
tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing,
our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample
of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let
$y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL
network accurately answers, with error probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a
newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network
is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a
network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting
that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.

*Lu Yin, You Wu, Zhenyu Zhang, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Yaqing Wang, Yiling Jia, Gen Li, Ajay Jaiswal, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Yi Liang, Michael Bendersky, Zhangyang Wang, Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OWL, a novel pruning method for LLMs that uses non-uniform layerwise sparsity based on activation outliers, outperforming existing methods in performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are difficult to deploy due to their size, and uniform pruning strategies may not be optimal. The study aims to understand why non-uniform sparsity works better in vision models and adapt it for LLMs.

Method: The authors propose Outlier Weighed Layerwise sparsity (OWL), where sparsity ratios are tailored to each layer's outlier ratio. This aligns weight sparsity with outlier patterns.

Result: OWL outperforms Wanda and SparseGPT, achieving significant perplexity gains (61.22 and 6.80) at 70% sparsity and a 2.6x speed-up in inference.

Conclusion: OWL demonstrates that non-uniform sparsity based on outlier ratios is effective for LLM pruning, offering better performance and efficiency than uniform methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), renowned for their remarkable performance
across diverse domains, present a challenge when it comes to practical
deployment due to their colossal model size. In response to this challenge,
efforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network
pruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can
be pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning
strategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all
layers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this
observation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field
of vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields
stronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we
conduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the
emergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we
introduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of
non-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise
sparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio
observed within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between
layerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation,
conducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks,
demonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For
instance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the
state-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by 61.22 and 6.80 perplexity at a high
sparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering 2.6x end-to-end inference
speed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine. Codes are available at

Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in real-world scientific workflows, such as memory, planning, and tool integration, by creating autonomous, context-aware agents.

Method: Dynamic agent construction from source code docs, augmented with FSA memory for state tracking and context-aware decisions, eliminating manual prompt engineering.

Result: Reliable execution, adaptive planning, and interpretable state transitions in tasks like bioassay retrieval and hardware integration.

Conclusion: Memory and state awareness are key for agentic planning, providing a scalable foundation for AI agents in complex environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural
language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex,
real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,
planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke
Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic
framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and
achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are
constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with
finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and
context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual
prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse
applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover
from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with
both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for
executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and
demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the
PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent
communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic
benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive
planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and
state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability,
offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex
environments.

TL;DR: Twill is a runtime framework for scheduling Compound AI (cAI) systems on mobile edge platforms, reducing latency by 54% while staying within power budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying cAI systems on mobile edge platforms is challenging due to dynamic workloads and the need for concurrent DNN-transformer inference, which existing methods cannot handle.

Method: Twill uses task affinity-aware cluster mapping, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and DVFS to manage concurrent cAI workloads.

Result: Twill reduces inference latency by 54% on average compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while adhering to power constraints.

Conclusion: Twill effectively addresses the scheduling challenges of cAI systems on heterogeneous mobile edge platforms.

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

Result: Establishes a foundation for Urban LLM Agents, providing a roadmap for integrating LLMs with urban intelligence.

Conclusion: Identifies trustworthiness and evaluation challenges, highlights open problems, and aims to advance the field of urban LLM agents.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient,
livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial
intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic
understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent

for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of
urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we
survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,
encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and
learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into
five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and
urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we
discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world
deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey

Motivation: Address the challenge of uncoordinated AI systems with unaligned objectives in shared environments.

Result: Case studies highlight the need for emergent, context-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: A shift toward self-organizing, adaptive AI systems is necessary for safe and effective coexistence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and
independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex
challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including
transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the
design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with
distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can
uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments
without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for
a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as
multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined
rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be
empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form
coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and
social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure
applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and
context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting social media post popularity is challenging due to complex multimodal interactions, motivating the need for advanced frameworks like HyperFusion.

Method: HyperFusion uses a three-tier fusion architecture with CLIP encoders, transformer models, and metadata. It combines CatBoost, TabNet, and MLPs, with pseudo-labeling for limited data.

Result: The framework achieved competitive performance, securing third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track).

Conclusion: HyperFusion effectively addresses the challenges of popularity prediction through hierarchical multimodal fusion and ensemble learning.

Abstract: Social media popularity prediction plays a crucial role in content
optimization, marketing strategies, and user engagement enhancement across
digital platforms. However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due
to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral
factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble
learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs
a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across
abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual
embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user
characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy
combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address
limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with
pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal
similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture
inter-modal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperFusion
achieves competitive performance on the SMP challenge dataset. Our team
achieved third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track). The source code

### [352] [Do Music Source Separation Models Preserve Spatial Information in Binaural Audio?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00155)
*Richa Namballa, Agnieszka Roginska, Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Evaluation of music source separation models on binaural audio reveals poor spatial information retention, with degradation varying by model and instrument.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of VR/AR and accessibility needs drives exploration of binaural audio in music information retrieval, focusing on spatial information preservation.

Method: Assessed spatial quality of MSS models on stereo and synthesized binaural datasets using signal processing and interaural cue metrics.

Result: Stereo MSS models fail to preserve spatial information, with degradation influenced by model architecture and target instrument.

Conclusion: Highlights opportunities for future work in MSS and immersive audio to improve spatial retention.

Abstract: Binaural audio remains underexplored within the music information retrieval
community. Motivated by the rising popularity of virtual and augmented reality
experiences as well as potential applications to accessibility, we investigate
how well existing music source separation (MSS) models perform on binaural
audio. Although these models process two-channel inputs, it is unclear how
effectively they retain spatial information. In this work, we evaluate how
several popular MSS models preserve spatial information on both standard stereo
and novel binaural datasets. Our binaural data is synthesized using stems from
MUSDB18-HQ and open-source head-related transfer functions by positioning
instrument sources randomly along the horizontal plane. We then assess the
spatial quality of the separated stems using signal processing and interaural
cue-based metrics. Our results show that stereo MSS models fail to preserve the
spatial information critical for maintaining the immersive quality of binaural
audio, and that the degradation depends on model architecture as well as the
target instrument. Finally, we highlight valuable opportunities for future work
at the intersection of MSS and immersive audio.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Stochastic methods like Normalizing Flows outperform deterministic baselines in generating expressive prosody for text-to-speech, matching human variability and offering controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating expressive prosody in text-to-speech synthesis is challenging, especially for systems using explicit parameters like pitch, energy, and duration.

Method: Investigated stochastic methods (Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, Rectified Flows) against deterministic baselines and human realizations.

Result: Stochastic methods produce prosody as natural as humans, capturing speech variability, and allow tuning sampling temperature for controllability.

Conclusion: Stochastic methods are effective for prosody generation, offering human-like variability and enhanced controllability.

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating
expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in
text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model
prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration,
which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In
this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this
task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified
Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as
well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective
evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par
with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech.
Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the
sampling temperature to be tuned.

Motivation: Most SASs are developed for English, degrading utility for other languages. This work investigates language adaptation for Japanese and Mandarin.

Method: Fine-tune SSL-based content encoder with Japanese speech; propose multilingual SSL fine-tuning for Japanese and Mandarin evaluation.

Result: Fine-tuning English-only SSL with target language improves intelligibility and privacy; multilingual SSL enhances cross-language utility.

Conclusion: Language adaptation and multilingual SSL pre-training are crucial for robust multilingual speaker anonymization.

Abstract: Speaker anonymization aims to protect speaker identity while preserving
content information and the intelligibility of speech. However, most speaker
anonymization systems (SASs) are developed and evaluated using only English,
resulting in degraded utility for other languages. This paper investigates
language mismatch in SASs for Japanese and Mandarin speech. First, we fine-tune
a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based content encoder with Japanese speech to
verify effective language adaptation. Then, we propose fine-tuning a
multilingual SSL model with Japanese speech and evaluating the SAS in Japanese
and Mandarin. Downstream experiments show that fine-tuning an English-only SSL
model with the target language enhances intelligibility while maintaining
privacy and that multilingual SSL further extends SASs' utility across
different languages. These findings highlight the importance of language
adaptation and multilingual pre-training of SSLs for robust multilingual
speaker anonymization.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A co-design framework for learnable analog front-end (AFE) and backend classifier in audio signal classification, optimizing both jointly for system-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Separate design of AFE and backend classifiers is common but suboptimal; joint optimization improves performance.

Method: Jointly optimizes AFE's transfer function (analog BPF bank) and classifier using an SNR-aware training loop and co-design loss function.

Result: Achieved 90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification, with 8.7% power and 12.9% capacitor area reduction.

Conclusion: The co-design framework outperforms conventional approaches in accuracy, power efficiency, and area savings.

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable
analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and
backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in
this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend
classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum.
More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass
filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training
loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows
superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented
in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved
90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of
input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters.
Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and
12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-aware LLMs hallucinate non-existent sounds, reducing reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes LISTEN, a contrastive-like training method using synthesized data and a lightweight adapter to integrate audio representations.

Result: LISTEN mitigates hallucinations while maintaining performance on audio benchmarks and is more efficient in data and computation.

Conclusion: LISTEN effectively improves the reliability of audio-aware LLMs without extensive modifications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) enable them
to process and understand audio inputs. However, these models often hallucinate
non-existent sound events, reducing their reliability in real-world
applications. To address this, we propose LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method that
enhances ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds using
synthesized data from the backbone LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method
requires no modification to LLM parameters and efficiently integrates audio
representations via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that LISTEN
effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining impressive performance
on existing audio question and reasoning benchmarks. At the same time, it is
more efficient in both data and computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research on non-Western instruments in MSS is limited due to lack of data, prompting exploration of Brazilian sama percussion.

Method: Artificial mixtures from a dataset of Brazilian sama percussion were used to train a U-Net model for separating the surdo drum.

Result: The model successfully isolates the surdo drum, leveraging its repetitive patterns and low-pitched timbre.

Conclusion: MSS systems can be adapted for culturally-inclusive scenarios without needing large datasets.

Abstract: Musical source separation (MSS) has recently seen a big breakthrough in
separating instruments from a mixture in the context of Western music, but
research on non-Western instruments is still limited due to a lack of data. In
this demo, we use an existing dataset of Brazilian sama percussion to create
artificial mixtures for training a U-Net model to separate the surdo drum, a
traditional instrument in samba. Despite limited training data, the model
effectively isolates the surdo, given the drum's repetitive patterns and its
characteristic low-pitched timbre. These results suggest that MSS systems can
be successfully harnessed to work in more culturally-inclusive scenarios
without the need of collecting extensive amounts of data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in acquiring large medical datasets due to privacy and accessibility issues hinder machine learning applications in medical imaging.

Method: Med-LSDM uses a diffusion model in the latent space of a pre-trained VQ-GAN to generate 3D synthetic data, reducing computational complexity.

Result: Achieves a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 and Dice scores (0.70964) close to real images (0.71496), showing minimal domain gap.

Conclusion: Med-LSDM effectively generates high-quality synthetic 3D medical images, useful for data augmentation and privacy preservation.

Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both
accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data
availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine
learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM
(Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and
leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of
privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that
focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D
semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full
volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D
image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space
of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model
significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical
3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic
medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional
Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images
(0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model
have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.

TL;DR: A novel method for fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation using 3D ultrasound volumes outperforms existing techniques by integrating multi-scale feature fusion and synthetic sample-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FBW estimation methods are inefficient, operator-dependent, and lack spatial accuracy. Deep learning approaches using 2D images or videos are limited in prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) with channel and spatial attention, and a synthetic sample-based learning framework (SSLF) to enhance feature extraction and prediction.

Result: Achieves a mean absolute error of 166.4±155.9 g and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.1±4.6%, surpassing existing methods and nearing senior doctor accuracy.

Conclusion: The method offers a more accurate and efficient FBW estimation from 3D ultrasound volumes, with potential to improve clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation is essential for optimizing
delivery decisions and reducing perinatal mortality. However, clinical methods
for FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to
apply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are
based on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial
information, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the
first method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach
integrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic
sample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses
multi-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel
attention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates
synthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from
different fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean
absolute percentage error of $5.1\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and
approaching the accuracy of a senior doctor. Code is available at:

Method: DEQReg formulates registration as an equilibrium-seeking problem, leveraging DEQ to maintain constant memory usage and enable unlimited iteration steps.

Result: DEQReg achieves competitive performance on brain MRI and lung CT datasets while reducing memory consumption and ensuring stable convergence.

Conclusion: DEQReg bridges the gap between classical and learning-based methods, offering a stable, memory-efficient solution for medical image registration.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an
optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively,
recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic
this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed
number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient
iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence
guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have
a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with
the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both
theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration
framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration
as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between
classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains
constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps.
Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we
show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while
substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art
unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of
existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly
when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast,
DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking
mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern
learning-based registration methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper discusses Video Super-Resolution (VSR) for conferencing, focusing on enhancing video quality using causal models under low-delay scenarios. It introduces a challenge with three tracks and a new screen content dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve video quality in conferencing by addressing the challenges of VSR, particularly for low-resolution videos encoded with H.265.

Method: The challenge involved three tracks (general-purpose, talking head, screen content) with datasets provided. Causal models were used for upscaling under low-delay constraints.

Result: A new screen content dataset was open-sourced, and submissions were evaluated via subjective tests using ITU-T Rec P.910.

Conclusion: The challenge successfully advanced VSR for conferencing, providing a framework and dataset for future research.

Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on
reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The
field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in
single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal
domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-,
bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration.
This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with
H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor,
providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay
scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks:
general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with
separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and
testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this
challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a
crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.

*Nuno Capitão, Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Qian Tao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework using Physics-Informed Neural ODEs accelerates $T_1$ mapping, improving accuracy and reducing scan time while incorporating physics constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged scanning and motion artifacts in conventional MOLLI methods, along with the lack of physics constraints in existing deep-learning approaches, necessitate a more efficient and interpretable solution.

Method: The proposed framework uses Physics-Informed Neural ODEs, specifically a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model, to enable sparse data acquisition and efficient $T_1$ estimation.

Result: The method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from fewer baseline images and outperforms data-driven priors, demonstrating robustness in native and post-contrast sequences.

Conclusion: The physics-based deep-learning approach offers a faster, more accurate, and interpretable solution for $T_1$ mapping, addressing limitations of conventional and existing deep-learning methods.

Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac
parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing
cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI)
acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure
mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients
with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image
quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a
signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies
have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened
sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless,
existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting
interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated,
end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these
challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse
subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test
time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable
selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags.
Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both
native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our
physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes MTCNet for 4D mitral valve ultrasound segmentation using semi-supervised learning, achieving high accuracy with sparse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack inter-phase dependency, limiting 4D mitral valve analysis due to motion artifacts and poor imaging quality.

Method: Uses cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning and topology-guided correlation regularization to leverage structural correspondence.

Result: Achieves superior performance (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm) on a large 4D MV dataset.

Conclusion: MTCNet effectively addresses challenges in 4D MV analysis and outperforms advanced methods.

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at

*Jan Nikolas Morshuis, Christian Schlarmann, Thomas Küstner, Christian F. Baumgartner, Matthias Hein*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantically Diverse Reconstructions (SDR) to address false negatives in deep learning-based MRI reconstruction by enhancing semantic variability while maintaining data consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI reconstruction techniques may miss small or rare pathologies, leading to false-negative diagnoses. The goal is to ensure clinically relevant information is preserved.

Method: Proposes SDR, a method generating diverse reconstructions from undersampled data, all consistent with measurements. Evaluated using an object detector on the fastMRI+ dataset.

Result: SDR reduces false negatives (higher recall) and improves mean average precision compared to original reconstructions.

Conclusion: SDR enhances diagnostic reliability by preserving clinical information in accelerated MRI reconstructions.

Abstract: In recent years, accelerated MRI reconstruction based on deep learning has
led to significant improvements in image quality with impressive results for
high acceleration factors. However, from a clinical perspective image quality
is only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant
information is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data.
In this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering
resampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small
and rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions
(false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we
propose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\SDR), a method which, given
an original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced
semantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured
data. To evaluate \SDR automatically we train an object detector on the
fastMRI+ dataset. We show that \SDR significantly reduces the chance of
false-negative diagnoses (higher recall) and improves mean average precision
compared to the original reconstructions. The code is available on

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for prompt-based multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation in Chest X-rays, using expert-generated doodle prompts and multi-stage feature fusion for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation models are limited to specific organs or diseases, lacking flexibility. Prompt-based methods offer adaptability, but no dedicated work exists for multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation in Chest X-rays.

Method: The work involves creating expert-generated doodle prompts for 23 classes (6 organs, 17 diseases) and developing Prompt2SegCXR, a model with multi-stage feature fusion for enhanced segmentation.

Result: Prompt2SegCXR outperforms existing pre-trained models in prompt-based segmentation, offering reliable Chest X-ray segmentation based on user prompts.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the gap in prompt-based, interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation for Chest X-rays, presenting a flexible and accurate solution.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field by isolating
organs or regions of interest from surrounding areas. Traditionally,
segmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting
their ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced
models can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater
flexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained
attention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based
on user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated
work on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,
especially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,
generating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from
multiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,
specifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we
introduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple
organs and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage
feature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for
better spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.
Compared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,
our model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest
X-rays based on user prompts.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model using ResNet18 and tunable wavelet units (OrthLatt-UwU and PR-Relax-UwU) was developed to classify ERM removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans, achieving up to 78% accuracy, outperforming human graders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of classifying ERM removal surgery types (ILM removal or ERM-alone removal) from postoperative OCT scans, aiding clinical decision-making.

Method: The model uses ResNet18 CNN with postoperative OCT scans as inputs, enhanced by tunable wavelet units (OrthLatt-UwU and PR-Relax-UwU) for adaptive filtering during training.

Result: The model achieved 78% accuracy with PR-Relax-UwU, outperforming human graders (50% accuracy) and original scans (66% accuracy).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of CNN-based models with tunable wavelets to enhance clinical decision-making in ERM surgery classification.

Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type
of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal
limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the
ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes
postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We
evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with
energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed
inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further
improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations:
Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect
Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units
allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training
and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling
layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and
ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU
increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model
outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in
classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These
findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical
decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for
classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.

Conclusion: YOLO-KFG achieves superior accuracy and efficiency for diabetic retinopathy detection, suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is one of the current
research focuses in ophthalmology. However, due to the subtle features of
micro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting
detection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and
robustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection
model based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a
new dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the
backbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions.
Secondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to
fully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's
ability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head
GSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more
deployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that
compared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter
count by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by
7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection

Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional artificial neuron designs, such as high energy consumption and lack of robustness, by proposing a more efficient and scalable hardware implementation.

Method: The ACN is implemented in 0.18μm CMOS technology, featuring a 12-bit single neuron with positive/negative weight support and a new Threshold Logic (TL) design for activation. Post-layout simulations and Monte Carlo analysis validate performance.

Result: The ACN achieves over 90% energy savings (12x improvement) compared to non-adiabatic benchmarks, with consistent performance across process corners, temperatures, and supply voltage scaling.

Conclusion: The ACN design offers a highly energy-efficient, robust, and scalable solution for artificial neurons, with significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new, highly energy-efficient, Adiabatic Capacitive
Neuron (ACN) hardware implementation of an Artificial Neuron (AN) with improved
functionality, accuracy, robustness and scalability over previous work. The
paper describes the implementation of a \mbox{12-bit} single neuron, with
positive and negative weight support, in an $\mathbf{0.18\mu m}$ CMOS
technology. The paper also presents a new Threshold Logic (TL) design for a
binary AN activation function that generates a low symmetrical offset across
three process corners and five temperatures between $-55^o$C and $125^o$C.
Post-layout simulations demonstrate a maximum rising and falling offset voltage
of 9$mV$ compared to conventional TL, which has rising and falling offset
voltages of 27$mV$ and 5$mV$ respectively, across temperature and process.
Moreover, the proposed TL design shows a decrease in average energy of 1.5$\%$
at the SS corner and 2.3$\%$ at FF corner compared to the conventional TL
design. The total synapse energy saving for the proposed ACN was above 90$\%$
(over 12x improvement) when compared to a non-adiabatic CMOS Capacitive Neuron
(CCN) benchmark for a frequency ranging from 500$kHz$ to 100$MHz$. A
1000-sample Monte Carlo simulation including process variation and mismatch
confirms the worst-case energy savings of $\>$90$\%$ compared to CCN in the
synapse energy profile. Finally, the impact of supply voltage scaling shows
consistent energy savings of above 90$\%$ (except all zero inputs) without loss
of functionality.

TL;DR: An anatomy-based post-processing method reduces false positives in DL models for intracranial aneurysm detection without losing true positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High false positive rates in DL models for aneurysm detection hinder clinical translation, despite advancements in model architectures and tuning.

Method: Used hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing on outputs from two DL models (CPM-Net and 3D-CNN-TR) trained on open-source CTAs. Applied five masking methods to remove FPs.

Result: Method 5 reduced FPs by 70.6% for CPM-Net and 51.6% for 3D-CNN-TR without reducing TPs, improving FP/case rates significantly.

Conclusion: Anatomy-based post-processing enhances DL model performance, suggesting hybrid heuristic-learning methods can boost clinical acceptance of aneurysm detection models.

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial
aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to
clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies
like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based,
heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to
further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D
convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with
1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143
held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and
cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible
FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)
vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more
than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79
false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were
commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;
3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular
(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing
CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without
reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from
1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable
post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More
broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds
promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm
detection models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor segmentation in MRI is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. Diffusion models show promise for such tasks.

Method: DMCIE combines a 3D U-Net for initial segmentation with a diffusion model guided by error maps and original MRI inputs.

Result: DMCIE achieves a Dice Score of 93.46 and HD95 of 5.94 mm on BraTS2020, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: Error-guided diffusion models like DMCIE enhance segmentation accuracy, proving effective for brain tumor analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable
clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models
have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation
tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based
on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of
Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in
multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation
mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences
between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with
the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal
MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation
accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs.
Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art
diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an
HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided
diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

Result: Distilled ViT achieves F1-score of 0.92 (teacher: 0.97) with reduced resources. Framework shows robustness in anomaly-distributed data.

Conclusion: The framework is clinically viable, adhering to realistic scenarios and offering reliable tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Reliable diagnosis of brain tumors remains challenging due to low clinical
incidence rates of such cases. However, this low rate is neglected in most of
proposed methods. We propose a clinically inspired framework for
anomaly-resilient tumor detection and classification. Detection leverages
YOLOv8n fine-tuned on a realistically imbalanced dataset (1:9 tumor-to-normal
ratio; 30,000 MRI slices from 81 patients). In addition, we propose a novel
Patient-to-Patient (PTP) metric that evaluates diagnostic reliability at the
patient level. Classification employs knowledge distillation: a Data Efficient
Image Transformer (DeiT) student model is distilled from a ResNet152 teacher.
The distilled ViT achieves an F1-score of 0.92 within 20 epochs, matching near
teacher performance (F1=0.97) with significantly reduced computational
resources. This end-to-end framework demonstrates high robustness in clinically
representative anomaly-distributed data, offering a viable tool that adheres to
realistic situations in clinics.

*Qing Xu, Jiaxuan Li, Xiangjian He, Chenxin Li, Fiseha B. Tesem, Wenting Duan, Zhen Chen, Rong Qu, Jonathan M. Garibaldi, Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: De-LightSAM is a lightweight, modality-decoupled SAM for medical image segmentation, addressing SAM's computational cost, manual prompt needs, and decoding issues. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only 2.0% of SAM-H's parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's limitations in medical scenarios—high computational costs, manual prompt dependency, and decoding conflicts—motivate a lightweight, domain-generalized solution.

Method: De-LightSAM uses a DC-Encoder for modality-specific features, SP-Generator for automatic prompts, QM-Decoder for independent modality decoding, and MDKD for knowledge distillation.

Result: De-LightSAM excels in medical segmentation tasks, showing superior universality and generalization while using minimal parameters.

Conclusion: De-LightSAM effectively addresses SAM's drawbacks for medical use, offering a lightweight, high-performance alternative.

Abstract: The universality of deep neural networks across different modalities and
their generalization capabilities to unseen domains play an essential role in
medical image segmentation. The recent segment anything model (SAM) has
demonstrated strong adaptability across diverse natural scenarios. However, the
huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and
conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalization capabilities
in medical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a
modality-decoupled lightweight SAM for domain-generalized medical image
segmentation, named De-LightSAM. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight
domain-controllable image encoder (DC-Encoder) that produces discriminative
visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the self-patch
prompt generator (SP-Generator) to automatically generate high-quality dense
prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the
query-decoupled modality decoder (QM-Decoder) that leverages a one-to-one
strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality,
preventing mutual knowledge interference of different modalities. Moreover, we
design a multi-modal decoupled knowledge distillation (MDKD) strategy to
leverage robust common knowledge to complement domain-specific medical feature
representations. Extensive experiments indicate that De-LightSAM outperforms
state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying
superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially,
De-LightSAM uses only 2.0% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is

### [382] [Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16553)
*Zhi-Song Liu, Markus Buttner, Vadym Aizinger, Andreas Rupp*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) is proposed to enhance coarse coastal ocean simulations into high-resolution spatiotemporal outputs, improving accuracy by 24% in RMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution simulations are crucial for understanding coastal processes like flooding from tsunamis and storm surges, but are computationally expensive.

Method: DNNCS uses grid-aware spatiotemporal attention, positional encoding, and physics-informed loss to enhance coarse inputs into high-resolution outputs.

Result: The method achieves a 24% improvement in RMSE and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downscaling quality and speed.

Conclusion: DNNCS effectively bridges the gap between coarse and high-resolution coastal simulations, offering computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse
representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications,
high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many
coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis
and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal
Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the
high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations
produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order
discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the
proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and
velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the
dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal
attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local
feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional
encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear
operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to
the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the
proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum
changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE). To train the proposed model, we propose a novel
coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation.
Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to
the state-of-the-art methods.

*Emerson P. Grabke, Masoom A. Haider, Babak Taati*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CCELLA, a dual-head conditioning approach for latent diffusion models (LDM) to improve medical image synthesis with limited data and minimal human annotation, enhancing both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current medical LDMs, which rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes, hindering performance and accessibility.

Method: Introduces CCELLA, a dual-head conditioning approach combining free-text clinical reports and radiology classification, alongside a data-efficient LDM framework and joint loss function.

Result: Achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025, outperforming a foundation model (FID 0.071). Synthetic images improve classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%.

Conclusion: CCELLA improves synthetic image quality and downstream tasks with limited data, enhancing LDM performance and accessibility. Code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity
challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However,
medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders,
non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance
and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to
address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient
Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach
that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports
and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework
centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate
our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a
downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our
method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited
3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model
with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction,
adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves
classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our
method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real
images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image
quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal
human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables
radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical
image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving
LDM performance and scientific accessibility. Code from this study will be
available at https://github.com/grabkeem/CCELLA

### [384] [Volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging and architectural validation in human finger flexors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20206)
*Yang Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel method for volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging was presented, focusing on the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) for finger control. Ultrasound and MRI were used for segmentation, while electromyography validated the results. The method showed high accuracy and physiological relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve movement function assessment, musculoskeletal modeling, and electromyogram simulation by accurately segmenting muscle compartments and measuring their architecture.

Method: A two-step piecewise segmentation: annotating compartment regions in ultrasound images based on movement, then registering to MRI. Architectural properties were measured using MRI tractography. Validation involved comparing fiber tracts and electromyogram centers.

Result: Fiber orientation matched cadaveric data. Significant differences in architectural properties between compartments were found. 95% of electromyogram centers were correctly located.

Conclusion: The validated method and derived properties can advance biomedical applications, demonstrating high accuracy and physiological relevance.

Abstract: Segmenting muscle compartments and measuring their architecture can
facilitate movement function assessment, accurate musculoskeletal modeling, and
synergy-based electromyogram simulation. Here, we presented a novel method for
volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging, focusing
on the independent compartments for finger control of flexor digitorum
superficialis (FDS). Besides, we measured the architectural properties of FDS
compartments and validated the segmentation. Specifically, ultrasound and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 10 healthy subjects were used for
segmentation and measurement, while electromyography was utilized for
validation. A two-step piecewise segmentation was proposed, first annotating
compartment regions in the cross-sectional ultrasound image based on
compartment movement, and then performing minimum energy matching to register
the ultrasound data to the three-dimensional MRI coordinate system.
Additionally, the architectural properties were measured in the compartment
masks from the segmentation using MRI tractography. Anatomical correctness was
verified by comparing known anatomy with reconstructed fiber tracts and
measured properties, while segmentation accuracy was quantified as the
percentage of finger electromyogram centers falling within their corresponding
compartments. Results demonstrated agreement for the fiber orientation between
the tractography and cadaveric photographs. Significant differences in
architectural properties (P < 0.001) were observed between compartments. The
properties of FDS and its compartments were within the physiological ranges (P
< 0.01). 95% (38/40) of the electromyogram centers were located within
respective compartments, with 2 errors occurring in the index and little
fingers. The validated segmentation method and derived architectural properties
may advance biomedical applications.

### [385] [Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22397)
*Anirban Ray, Ashesh, Florian Jug*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HazeMatching is a novel iterative method for dehazing microscopy images, balancing fidelity and realism by adapting conditional flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cheaper microscopy modalities like widefield produce hazy images; existing dehazing methods prioritize either fidelity or realism, not both.

Method: HazeMatching uses conditional flow matching, guiding the generative process with hazy observations in the conditional velocity field.

Result: Evaluated on 5 datasets, HazeMatching outperforms 7 baselines, balancing fidelity and realism, and produces well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: HazeMatching effectively balances fidelity and realism in dehazing microscopy images without needing an explicit degradation operator.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

*Xing Shen, Justin Szeto, Mingyang Li, Hengguan Huang, Tal Arbel*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CALIN is an inference-time calibration method addressing calibration biases and demographic unfairness in MLLMs for medical image classification, improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe deployment of MLLMs in clinical practice requires analyzing prediction accuracies and calibration errors across demographic subgroups.

Method: CALIN uses a bi-level procedure to estimate calibration matrices (population to subgroup level) and applies them to calibrate confidence scores during inference.

Result: CALIN improves prediction accuracy and ensures fair confidence calibration across three medical imaging datasets with minimal fairness-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: CALIN effectively mitigates biases in MLLMs, enhancing their reliability for medical image classification in diverse populations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform
few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However,
safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an
in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated
calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In
this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and
demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot
in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an
inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases.
Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by
calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the
population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this
estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference.
Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image
classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for
chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair
confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall
prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

TL;DR: SurgTPGS introduces a text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method for 3D surgical scene understanding, combining segmentation and vision-language models for real-time queries and precise reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D surgical scene comprehension with text-promptable capabilities is critical for surgical planning and intra-operative guidance, but existing methods lack real-time text-promptable 3D queries.

Method: Uses a 3D semantics feature learning strategy with Segment Anything and vision-language models, semantic-aware deformation tracking, and semantic region-aware optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world surgical datasets, improving reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness.

Conclusion: SurgTPGS enhances surgical precision and safety, paving the way for next-generation intelligent surgical systems.

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:
