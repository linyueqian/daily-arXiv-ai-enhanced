In\nthis work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used\nRWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:\nPose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for\nrealistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven\npose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of\nmultimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text\nsemantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce\nposture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,\nbased on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a\ncross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse\nsign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the\ndiversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is\nintroduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss\nweighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity\nof information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and\nensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose\nmodalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce\nhigh-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the\ngenerated sign videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "SignAligner, a novel method for realistic sign language generation, uses text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and video synthesis to improve accuracy and expressiveness.", "motivation": "Achieving realistic and naturalistic sign language generation is challenging due to the complexity of gestures, expressions, and movements.", "method": "SignAligner involves three stages: text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and realistic video synthesis, leveraging Transformer-based text encoding and cross-modal attention.", "result": "Extensive experiments show SignAligner significantly enhances the accuracy and expressiveness of generated sign videos.", "conclusion": "The proposed method advances sign language generation by addressing multimodal complexity and improving realism."}}

Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates\nin life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to\nensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to\ndistinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon\nprocedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.\nTo address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality\ndataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform\ninterpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from\nthe cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and\nintroduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the\n1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five\nfundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152\nstrategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next\naction as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that\nleverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current\nsurgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected\nsurgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the\nbroader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art\nMLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,\nStep-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces SAP-Bench, a dataset for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in surgical action planning (SAP), highlighting gaps in current benchmarks and model performance.", "motivation": "Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate MLLMs for surgical action planning, a life-critical task requiring precision and reliability.", "method": "SAP-Bench, a dataset of 1,226 clinically validated action clips from cholecystectomy procedures, is introduced.

However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational\nlearning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate\nin multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;\nand (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially\ncoupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy\namplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework\nfor relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a\nrigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping\nscheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.\nWe also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of\ncoupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These\ncontributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with\nprovable privacy guarantees.

This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each\nexposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the\ndifference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the\ncommonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.\nWe introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower\nvariance than the standard approach.
