### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil, Salomé Andres, Atul Anand, Bruce Guthrie, Huayu Zhang, Abul Hasan, Honghan Wu, Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from elderly patients' discharge summaries is presented, addressing underrepresented AEs and complex annotation challenges. Transformer models perform well on coarse tasks but struggle with fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical NLP resources and tackle challenges like discontinuous and overlapping entities in AE extraction.

Method: A manually annotated dataset of 14 clinically significant AEs is created, evaluated using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities, with transformer models like BERT-cased tested.

Result: BERT-cased excels in coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943) but struggles with fine-grained tasks (F1 = 0.675), especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite strong high-level performance, detecting underrepresented AEs and nuanced clinical language remains challenging. The dataset, available via DataLoch, serves as a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota, Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) improves structured NLP tasks by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases, leveraging complementary errors for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on implicit constraints during training, leading to low-quality outputs during constrained decoding. BoostCD addresses this by explicitly combining constrained and unconstrained predictions.

Method: BoostCD uses a two-phase approach: Phase 1 generates weak predictions (constrained and unconstrained) from the base model. Phase 2 combines these predictions using a learned boosted model.

Result: BoostCD, applied to closed information extraction (BoostIE), outperforms prior methods in and out of distribution, reducing common errors.

Conclusion: BoostCD effectively improves structured NLP task performance by leveraging complementary predictions, demonstrating its advantage over traditional constrained decoding methods.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila, Shuai Zhang, Boran Han, Bonan Min, Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst is a weakly supervised framework for assessing context document credibility in LLMs, improving accuracy and F1 scores without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore varying credibility of context documents, risking unreliable information propagation.

Method: CrEst uses inter-document agreement for automated credibility estimation and integrates it into LLM inference via black-box and white-box strategies.

Result: CrEst outperforms baselines, achieving up to 26.86% accuracy and 3.49% F1 score improvements, even under high noise.

Conclusion: CrEst effectively enhances LLM performance by addressing context credibility, demonstrating robustness and scalability.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper, Wenzhao Qiu, Ali Payani, Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench is a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on multi-document reasoning, created via synthetic generation to address the lack of benchmarks in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multi-document reasoning are scarce due to high annotation costs, despite its relevance to LLM capabilities.

Method: MDBench uses a synthetic generation process with LLM-assisted edits on structured seed knowledge to create document sets and QA examples.

Result: MDBench proves challenging for current LLMs and prompting techniques, even with short document sets.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique enables targeted analysis and adaptability for future modeling improvements.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.

### [5] [PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models through Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15556)
*Shufan Li, Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PredGen reduces LLM latency in voice chat by generating responses while the user speaks, cutting delay by ~2x with minimal added cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in voice chat cause latency due to slow first-sentence generation, degrading user experience, especially on consumer hardware.

Method: Proposed Predictive Generation (PredGen) uses speculative decoding to generate candidate responses during user speech, enabling faster TTS processing.

Result: Simulated experiments show PredGen reduces latency by ~2x with minimal extra computation.

Conclusion: PredGen effectively addresses LLM latency in voice chat, improving responsiveness without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

### [6] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib, Oishy Fatema Akhand, Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores LLMs for diabetes prediction using PIDD, comparing six LLMs (including GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0) with traditional ML models. Proprietary LLMs outperform open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B leading in accuracy. Gemma-2-27B also beats ML models in F1-score. Challenges include prompt sensitivity and fine-tuning needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the untapped potential of LLMs for structured numerical data in diabetes prediction, comparing their performance with traditional ML models.

Method: Empirical analysis using PIDD, evaluating six LLMs (four open-source, two proprietary) and three ML models via zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting. Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Result: Proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) outperform open-source models. Gemma-2-27B excels in F1-score, surpassing traditional ML models. Performance varies with prompting strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for medical predictions but require prompt engineering and hybrid approaches for optimal healthcare applications.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [7] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre, Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate reversible sentence embeddings using a special memory token, enabling exact text reconstruction without weight modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capability to reconstruct original text from embeddings without altering model weights.

Method: Introduce a memory token optimized through training on fixed sequences; evaluate across languages, token lengths, and model sizes.

Result: Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs sequences up to ~240 tokens in English and Spanish.

Conclusion: This capability has potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [8] [Multi-Agent Language Models: Advancing Cooperation, Coordination, and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09331)
*Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can model and reason about others' intentions (theory of mind) using cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance collaboration between humans and AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding intentions is key for collaboration, and LLMs' ability to infer meaning raises questions about their theory of mind capabilities.

Method: Investigates theory of mind in LLMs via cooperative MARL, where agents learn through repeated interactions.

Result: Aims to improve AI's ability to cooperate with humans and other agents, advancing hybrid human-AI systems.

Conclusion: The study has broad implications for future human-AI collaboration, suggesting LLMs can enhance cooperative interactions.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question: can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

### [9] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker, Swati Rajwal, Sudeshna Das, Snigdha Peddireddy, Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify social isolation and loneliness in suicide narratives, revealing higher risks for men, gay individuals, and divorced people.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising suicide rates linked to social isolation and loneliness by improving detection through NLP.

Method: Used topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers on NVDRS narratives.

Result: High-quality classifiers (F1: .86, accuracy: .82) identified 1,198 cases of chronic social isolation, with higher odds for specific demographics.

Conclusion: The methods can enhance surveillance and prevention of social isolation-related suicides.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over 300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR = 3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001). We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up. Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in the United States.

### [10] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li, Yapei Chang, Yuhang Zhou, Xiyang Wu, Zichao Liang, Yoo Yeon Sung, Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT is a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation, outperforming traditional metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore by aligning better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating long-form generation lack coherence, style, or relevance, and are biased by pretraining data.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on diverse long-form response datasets with Likert-rated quality to provide semantic reward feedback for GRPO.

Result: PrefBERT outperforms traditional metrics, aligns well with human preferences, and improves policy model training.

Conclusion: PrefBERT offers a reliable and human-aligned solution for evaluating and improving long-form generation.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Seewo's system improves ASR and SD-ASR using multi-stage training with curriculum learning, Chain-of-Thought augmentation, and RLVR, achieving better WER/CER than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning and self-correction in speech language models for ASR and SD-ASR tasks.

Method: Multi-stage training pipeline with curriculum learning, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation, and RLVR for self-correction.

Result: Achieved WER/CER of 11.57% for Track 1 and tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% for Track 2, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed components are effective under challenge constraints, demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents Seewo's systems for both tracks of the Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge (MLC-SLM), addressing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization with ASR (SD-ASR). We introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that explicitly enhances reasoning and self-correction in speech language models for ASR. Our approach combines curriculum learning for progressive capability acquisition, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation to foster intermediate reflection, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further refine self-correction through reward-driven optimization. This approach achieves substantial improvements over the official challenge baselines. On the evaluation set, our best system attains a WER/CER of 11.57% for Track 1 and a tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% for Track 2. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component under challenge constraints.

### [12] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu, Konstantin Garov, Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding affect the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge in LLMs, finding paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning and highlighting challenges in unlearning from text chunks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable post-hoc unlearning in LLMs for reasons like privacy and content correction, given prior work assumes fixed training and models.

Method: Empirical investigation of how learning-time knowledge encoding impacts unlearning, with experiments on paraphrased descriptions and text chunks.

Result: Paraphrased descriptions enhance unlearning performance, but unlearning from text chunks is difficult.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding is crucial for enabling effective post-hoc unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

*Yaxin Fan, Peifeng Li, Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) are proposed to improve dialogue discourse parsing by resolving ambiguities and optimizing clarifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in dialogues (e.g., omissions, idioms) obscure discourse relations, challenging parsers.

Method: DCM uses clarification type and discourse goal reasoning; CPO optimizes clarifications by assessing their contributions.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines on STAC and Molweni datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively resolves ambiguities and enhances parser performance.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang, Hongshun Ling, Li Zhang, Longqian Zhang, Fang Wang, Yuan Gao, Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CKD-EHR, a framework using knowledge distillation to improve EHR-based disease prediction by enhancing medical knowledge representation and clinical deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models lack sufficient medical knowledge representation and are inefficient for clinical deployment.

Method: The CKD-EHR framework fine-tunes Qwen2.5-7B as a teacher model, generates soft labels via multi-granularity attention distillation, and transfers knowledge to a lightweight BERT student model.

Result: On MIMIC-III, CKD-EHR boosts diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2x inference speedup.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR enhances diagnosis accuracy, speed, and resource efficiency, offering a practical solution for clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

### [15] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee, Kong-Aik Lee, Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage framework for Open-domain Dialogue (OD) generation, focusing on Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS) to enhance diversity and quality. It uses the o2mDial corpus and new evaluation metrics, improving smaller LLMs' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based dialogue agents ignore the one-to-many (o2m) property of OD, limiting response diversity. This work aims to explicitly model o2m to improve diversity and coherence.

Method: Decomposes OD into MRG (generating diverse responses) and PS (selecting based on preference). Introduces o2mDial corpus, in-context learning, instruction-tuning, and new metrics.

Result: The framework boosts response diversity and quality by up to 90%, making smaller LLMs competitive with larger ones.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling o2m in OD generation enhances diversity and coherence, proving effective for smaller LLMs.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho, Yeonkyoun So, Chanwoo Park, Sangmin Lee, Sungmok Jung, Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok is a Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility by 10% without performance loss, using rule-based pre-tokenization and branching entropy-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient tokenizer for Korean that reduces token fertility (number of tokens) while maintaining model performance.

Method: Uses rule-based pre-tokenization aligned with Korean linguistic structure, a seed vocabulary of linguistic units, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Reduces token fertility by ~10%, improving inference speed by 10% without performance loss in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The linguistically informed approach of Thunder-Tok is effective and practical for efficient tokenizer design.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

### [17] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga, Hilal AlQuabeh, Munachiso S Nwadike, Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates memory mechanisms in state-space language models, revealing primacy and recency effects through structured recall tasks in the Mamba architecture. It identifies three key mechanisms: long-term memory via sparse channels, short-term memory via delta-modulated recurrence, and dynamic memory allocation based on semantic regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how state-space language models retain and forget information over time, using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools.

Method: Structured recall tasks applied to the Mamba architecture, with targeted ablations and input perturbations on 1.4B and 7B parameter models.

Result: A U-shaped accuracy profile emerges, with strong performance at sequence start and end. Three mechanisms explain this: sparse long-term memory channels, delta-modulated short-term memory, and dynamic allocation based on semantic regularity.

Conclusion: The study uncovers distinct memory mechanisms in state-space models, highlighting how primacy, recency, and semantic context shape memory retention and forgetting.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for SDG-related text classification, finding that optimized smaller models can match larger ones like GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking SDG progress is challenging due to data complexity, and LLMs offer potential for automating text analysis.

Method: Analyzed proprietary and open-source LLMs for SDG text classification, testing Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning.

Result: Smaller models with prompt engineering perform as well as larger models like GPT.

Conclusion: Optimized smaller LLMs are viable for SDG text classification, reducing reliance on large models.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

*Feng He, Zijun Chen, Xinnian Liang, Tingting Ma, Yunqi Qiu, Shuangzhi Wu, Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning enhances LLMs' reasoning by using abstract prototypes, improving performance across tasks like logic, planning, and math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve cross-domain generalization in Large Reasoning Models by identifying shared abstract reasoning prototypes.

Method: Proposes ProtoReasoning, a framework with automated prototype construction, verification via Prolog/PDDL, and scalability.

Result: Achieves 4.7% (logic), 6.3% (planning), 4.0% (general reasoning), and 1.0% (math) improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Learning in prototype space enhances generalization, validating shared reasoning prototypes as foundational for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [20] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan, Yating Wang, Guandong Wang, Jie Zhai, Jingping Liu, Qi Ye, Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval is a new method for evaluating open-ended QA, distinguishing factoid and non-factoid questions and using tailored strategies for each, outperforming traditional metrics and aligning better with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) fail to capture semantic nuances and lack interpretability, especially for open-ended questions. Current LLM-based methods also overlook question type distinctions.

Method: MinosEval classifies questions as factoid or non-factoid, then applies adaptive key-point scoring for factoid questions and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid ones.

Result: Experiments show MinosEval aligns better with human annotations and provides more interpretable results than existing methods.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses limitations of current QA evaluation methods by adapting to question types, improving alignment with human judgment and interpretability.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates language technologies' ability to understand Basque and Spanish varieties, revealing performance drops due to linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well current language models handle linguistic variation in Basque and Spanish, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Method: Uses a manually-curated parallel dataset for NLI, testing encoder-only and decoder-based LLMs with crosslingual and in-context learning.

Result: Performance declines with linguistic variation, particularly in Basque, with encoder-only models struggling most with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Linguistic variation, not lexical overlap, causes performance drops, aligning with linguistic theory about peripheral dialects.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

Motivation: To address domain knowledge gaps in large language models for historical text analysis, reducing labor costs and improving accuracy in computational humanities.

Method: Proposes Graph RAG, integrating knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, with chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruction generation.

Result: The domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieves F1=0.68 in relation extraction. GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% on C-CLUE, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Graph RAG provides a low-resource solution for historical knowledge extraction, benefiting humanities research and knowledge services.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction, reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B, with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12), effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Motivation: To improve answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness in large-scale question answering by leveraging clustering and multi-stage prompt aggregation.

Method: Uses hybrid retrieval (sparse/dense indices), K-Means clustering, and cluster-specific prompts for an LLM, followed by filtering, reranking, and synthesis.

Result: Ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation enhance large-scale RAG systems, as demonstrated by TopClustRAG's performance.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model (LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence. Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation in large-scale RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Thunder-DeID, a framework for de-identifying court judgments in South Korea, addressing legal and technical challenges with a DNN-based pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current de-identification processes are inadequate for large-scale court judgments, and legal definitions of personal identifiers are vague.

Method: Develops Thunder-DeID, including a Korean legal dataset, systematic PII categorization, and a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID effectively balances open justice and data protection, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

TL;DR: The paper surveys LLM-based approaches for clinical trial-patient matching, highlighting their potential and current limitations like reliance on proprietary models and weak benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' success in general NLP tasks, their use in critical domains like clinical trial recruitment is limited. The paper aims to explore and contextualize LLM-based solutions for trial-patient matching.

Method: The survey analyzes existing benchmarks, approaches, and evaluation frameworks for LLM-assisted trial-patient matching, along with challenges and future directions.

Result: LLMs show promise for trial-patient matching but face issues like proprietary model reliance and inadequate benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper calls for improved benchmarks and open models to better leverage LLMs in clinical trial recruitment.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Motivation: Low-resource languages perform poorly in LID due to class imbalance and bias, often limited to single-domain data like the Bible.

Method: Proposed a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages.

Result: The approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The SCL method effectively enhances LID models for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TSLFormer is a lightweight Turkish Sign Language recognition model using 3D joint positions for efficient input, treating gestures as sequences and achieving competitive performance with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust and efficient sign language recognition system for Turkish Sign Language (TSL) that leverages joint-based input for real-time, mobile, and assistive communication.

Method: Uses 3D joint positions (articulation points) extracted via Mediapipe, treating gestures as sequences and applying a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence approach with self-attention to capture temporal patterns.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on the AUTSL dataset (36,000+ samples, 227 words) with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Joint-based input is sufficient for real-time, mobile assistive systems, demonstrating the viability of TSLFormer for hearing-impaired communication.

Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered, string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important semantic gesture information. Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words unfold. Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs in clinical settings often miss genuine medical reasoning, necessitating a framework like DeVisE for finer-grained assessment.

Method: DeVisE uses ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, creating real-world and synthetic versions with controlled counterfactuals. It evaluates five LLMs on input-level sensitivity and downstream reasoning.

Result: Zero-shot models show coherent counterfactual reasoning, while fine-tuned models are stable but less responsive to clinical changes. Demographic factors subtly influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing like DeVisE is crucial for understanding clinical LLMs and designing safer, more transparent AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: To address the lack of cultural context in language models, especially for India's diverse culture.

Method: Created SANSKRITI, a dataset with 21,853 question-answer pairs covering 16 cultural attributes across India's regions.

Result: Evaluation showed significant disparities in models' ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with struggles in region-specific contexts.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving cultural understanding in language models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity. Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research in Indian languages for comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization, bridging gaps in resources and fostering inclusivity.

Method: Introduces COSMMIC, a dataset with 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 comments. Tests summarization across four configurations (text, comments, images, combined) using LLama3, GPT-4, and classifiers like IndicBERT and multilingual CLIP.

Result: The dataset uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback, enabling effective NLG tasks and advancing NLP research for Indian languages.

Conclusion: COSMMIC fills a critical gap in Indian language resources, offering a holistic approach to multimodal summarization and promoting inclusivity in NLP.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning method to improve lexical alignment in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Swahili for LLMs, showing significant improvements in cross-lingual word pair similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underperformance of LLMs in low-resource languages due to data scarcity and poor cross-lingual lexical alignment.

Method: Proposes TLI, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to fine-tune embeddings from an optimal early layer (Layer 2) in a Swahili-centric LLM.

Result: TLI improves lexical alignment for trained and unseen word pairs, increasing cosine similarity by ~28% with high statistical significance.

Conclusion: TLI effectively enhances cross-lingual knowledge propagation in LLMs for LRLs, offering a parameter-efficient solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate and improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI agents, addressing hallucinations and uncertainty with new metrics and techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often suffer from systematic localization errors (hallucinations) that reduce reliability in GUI interactions, necessitating better evaluation and improvement methods.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained evaluation framework, the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) for uncertainty quantification, and Context-Aware Cropping for performance enhancement.

Result: The framework reveals nuanced failure modes, and the proposed methods improve interpretability and robustness of GUI agents.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights and tools to enhance the reliability and performance of MLLMs in GUI interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 is a comprehensive solution for efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems, excelling in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE is a framework to assess LLMs' reasoning hierarchy (associations, interventions, counterfactuals) by generating varied problems, revealing reliance on statistical recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether LLMs' high accuracy stems from true reasoning or training data memorization.

Method: Introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework with an automated pipeline to create problem variations at different reasoning levels.

Result: Performance drops when LLMs face varied problems, indicating reliance on memorization.

Conclusion: LLMs may depend on statistical recall; the framework enables targeted research on reasoning skills.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: CINGS improves LLM grounding by training with context prepended to responses, masking context in loss. It outperforms in text and vision domains without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to ground responses in external context, leading to hallucinations. CINGS aims to ensure grounded generation by modifying training supervision.

Method: Proposes CINGS: trains models with context prepended to responses, masking context in loss calculation. Evaluated on 11 text datasets and vision-language benchmarks.

Result: CINGS-trained models show stronger grounding in text and vision domains, reducing hallucinations and maintaining factual consistency without performance loss.

Conclusion: CINGS effectively shifts model behavior to rely more on external context, improving grounding without compromising general performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

TL;DR: SPARE introduces a structured framework for efficient, high-quality automated process annotation in LLMs, improving reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for LLMs is challenging but crucial for advancing multi-step reasoning.

Method: SPARE uses single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning steps to reference solutions with explicit reasoning for evaluation.

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance in offline RL and reward model training, achieving competitive results with greater efficiency.

Conclusion: SPARE is a promising framework for process supervision, offering efficiency and performance gains, with publicly released code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

### [37] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng, Sihang Wang, Hao Fei, Zuquan Peng, Fei Li, Jianming Fu, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for detecting hyperbole and metaphor in text, leveraging bidirectional dynamic interaction and emotion analysis to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hyperbole and metaphor detection focus on superficial features, missing deeper associations and implicit emotions. This limits their effectiveness.

Method: EmoBi includes an emotion analysis module, emotion-based domain mapping, and bidirectional dynamic interaction, with a verification mechanism for accuracy.

Result: EmoBi outperforms baselines, with F1 scores increasing by 28.1% for hyperbole and 23.1% for metaphor detection on specific datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and potential for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection in NLP.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning to improve grounding in LLMs, achieving better performance in answer correctness, citation quality, and refusal handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating trustworthy and grounded responses in LLMs, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios where models often fail.

Method: Uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) with outcome-based rewards for training, focusing on answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality. A two-stage training setup is employed.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models outperform instruction-only variants, especially in unanswerable queries and well-cited responses. Combining GRPO with GPT-4 distillation further enhances performance.

Conclusion: Reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL are valuable for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

*Bailin Wang, Chang Lan, Chong Wang, Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION improves local-global attention models by integrating linear attention for out-of-window tokens, achieving better efficiency and performance with smaller window sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of local attention ignoring tokens outside the window, aiming to shift the Pareto frontier for efficiency gains in short-context scenarios.

Method: Introduces RATTENTION, combining local attention with a specialized linear attention mechanism to capture out-of-window tokens.

Result: RATTENTION with a 512 window size matches full-attention performance, enhances long-context performance, and maintains training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION offers a superior tradeoff between performance and efficiency, validated by pretraining experiments and benchmarks.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of closed training data in modern language models by approximating useful data from model weights.

Method: Proposes a gradient-based approach to select high-matching data from public corpora, tested on classification and supervised-finetuning tasks.

Result: Achieves 80% accuracy on AG News (vs. 65% random) and reduces perplexity to 2.3 on MSMARCO (vs. 3.3 random), nearing expert benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness in recovering useful training data from weights, closing performance gaps without access to original data.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task, our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive metrics for evaluating gender inclusivity in LLMs, especially for non-binary genders, and to uncover biases in model behaviors.

Method: Developed GIFI, a multi-level evaluation metric, and tested it on 22 LLMs, analyzing biases in pronoun usage, generation, and cognitive behaviors under diverse gender assumptions.

Result: Found significant variations in gender inclusivity across models, highlighting biases and the need for improvement.

Conclusion: GIFI serves as a critical benchmark for advancing gender fairness in LLMs, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity in generative models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

*Shaoqing Lin, Chong Teng, Fei Li, Donghong Ji, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSG, a task for discourse-level text scene graph parsing, addressing limitations of current methods by proposing a dataset (DiscoSG-DS) and a refinement model (DiscoSG-Refiner) that improves performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text scene graph parsers fail to handle multi-sentence descriptions effectively, missing cross-sentence phenomena like coreference, leading to fragmented graphs and poor performance in VLM tasks.

Method: The authors create DiscoSG-DS, a dataset with multi-sentence caption-graph pairs, and propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which uses two small PLMs to draft and iteratively refine graphs, reducing computational overhead.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by 30% over baselines, achieves 86x faster inference than GPT-4, and enhances downstream VLM tasks like caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: The proposed DiscoSG framework and dataset effectively address discourse-level parsing challenges, offering a scalable and efficient solution for improving VLM performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

Motivation: To address the challenges of automatic document understanding, particularly with complex layouts, tables, and charts, and to evaluate the effectiveness of vision-language models in long-context scenarios.

Method: Introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark with 1,000 MCQs based on tables and charts from 4,000 Wikipedia pages, testing cross-modal reasoning. Evaluates 12 state-of-the-art models.

Result: Proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context but drop significantly in retrieval tasks. GPT-4-o leads with >50% accuracy; open-source models max at 27%.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA highlights the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and serves as a key benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MCQ creation is time-consuming, and generative AI offers automation potential, but quality assessment, especially in non-English languages like Portuguese, is understudied.

Method: The study generates Portuguese MCQs for reading comprehension, aligns them with curriculum elements, and evaluates quality via expert review and psychometric analysis of student responses.

Result: Current models produce MCQs comparable to human-authored ones but face issues with semantic clarity, answerability, and distractor quality.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise for MCQ automation in Portuguese, but improvements are needed in semantic clarity and distractor design for real-world application.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

TL;DR: The paper studies regret in large language models (LLMs), proposing methods to identify and analyze regret expressions and neurons, addressing key challenges with new metrics and workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding regret in LLMs is crucial for enhancing model reliability and revealing cognitive coding in neural networks.

Method: The study identifies regret expressions, analyzes hidden states, and introduces metrics (S-CDI, RDS, GIC) to address dataset, layer, and neuron challenges.

Result: The S-CDI metric identified the optimal regret layer, improving probe classification. The RDS metric categorized neurons into regret, non-regret, and dual types, revealing an M-shaped decoupling pattern.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address key challenges in studying regret in LLMs, enhancing understanding of model cognition and reliability.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino, Matthias Hofer, Max Siegel, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Robert D. Hawkins*

TL;DR: Cross-cultural differences in interpreting intensifiers like 'quite' and 'very' stem from both literal meanings and pragmatic factors like utterance cost, not just semantics or politeness norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether cross-cultural misunderstandings arise from literal word meanings or pragmatic factors like politeness and brevity.

Method: Three experiments with British and American English speakers, supported by a computational cognitive model analyzing informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: Differences in intensifier interpretation arise from a mix of literal meanings and weights on utterance cost.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural interpretation differences result from an interplay between semantics and pragmatic factors, challenging single-factor explanations.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper, we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity, politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [48] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Ordered CommonGen benchmark to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization, revealing biases and low ordered coverage (75% max).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' ability to follow concept order instructions in generative tasks, addressing biases and low diversity in outputs.

Method: Introduces Ordered CommonGen benchmark, measuring ordered coverage of concepts in generated sentences, tested on 36 LLMs.

Result: LLMs show instruction understanding but biases cause low-diversity outputs; best model achieved only 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: Highlights need for improving LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization, as current capabilities are insufficient.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address authorship attribution for Romanian texts using the ROST corpus and evaluate lightweight, interpretable methods.

Method: Systematic evaluation of SVM, LR, k-NN, DT, RF, and ANN using character n-gram features.

Result: ANN achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in some runs with 5-gram features.

Conclusion: Lightweight character n-gram approaches can rival complex methods, especially in resource-constrained or under-studied languages.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight, interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource, constrained or under-studied language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CC-Learn, a reinforcement learning framework, improves LLM reasoning consistency by training on cohorts of similar questions and optimizing a composite objective for uniform reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with consistent and robust reasoning, despite excelling in many tasks.

Method: CC-Learn uses reinforcement learning to optimize a composite objective (cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, rejection penalty) derived from cohorts of similar questions.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA show improved accuracy and reasoning stability over baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

*Tommaso Green, Martin Gubri, Haritz Puerto, Sangdoo Yun, Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Privacy leakage in reasoning traces of large models is a significant issue, as sensitive data can be extracted or leaked, especially with increased reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that reasoning traces are safe and internal, highlighting their vulnerability to privacy breaches.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations to analyze leakage in reasoning traces, focusing on test-time compute approaches.

Result: Increased reasoning steps amplify privacy leakage, revealing a trade-off between utility and privacy.

Conclusion: Safety efforts must address internal reasoning traces, not just final outputs, to mitigate privacy risks.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 21 MT systems for their ability to maintain gender neutrality in translations, finding most systems fail but a few use specific strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving gender ambiguity in MT, especially in grammatical gender languages, to avoid misgendering and representational harms.

Method: Assessed 21 MT systems across three translation directions, categorizing observed gender-neutral strategies and examining binary gender stereotypes' impact.

Result: Most systems lacked gender-neutral translations, but a few employed specific strategies depending on the target language.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved gender-inclusive MT, with some promising strategies identified.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English, maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific strategies, depending on the target language.

TL;DR: GenRecal is a distillation framework for VLMs that addresses architectural diversity, enabling efficient knowledge transfer and outperforming large-scale VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large VLMs on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to computational demands, necessitating efficient distillation methods.

Method: GenRecal uses a Recalibrator to align feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs for effective knowledge transfer.

Result: GenRecal improves baseline performances and outperforms large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs in benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal provides a general-purpose solution for efficient VLM distillation, overcoming architectural limitations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhantomHunter is a detector for text from privately-tuned LLMs, outperforming baselines with 96% F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of privately-tuned LLMs has degraded existing detectors' performance, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: PhantomHunter uses a family-aware learning framework to detect shared traits across base models and their derivatives.

Result: It achieves over 96% F1 scores, surpassing 7 baselines and 3 industrial services.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter effectively addresses the challenge of detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiURE is a novel contrastive learning framework for unsupervised relation extraction, addressing issues like gradual drift and semantic similarity loss in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from gradual drift problems or unreasonably separate semantically similar sentences, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: HiURE uses cross-hierarchy attention and exemplar-wise contrastive learning to derive hierarchical signals and optimize relation representations.

Result: HiURE outperforms state-of-the-art models on two public datasets, showing advanced effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: HiURE provides a superior solution for unsupervised relation extraction by effectively leveraging hierarchical signals and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised relation extraction aims to extract the relationship between entities from natural language sentences without prior information on relational scope or distribution. Existing works either utilize self-supervised schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the advanced effectiveness and robustness of HiURE on unsupervised relation extraction when compared with state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: External knowledge in sequence labeling introduces data heterogeneity and complexity, increasing training costs.

Method: The TCL framework uses curriculum learning, assessing task difficulty with various metrics, and is tested on Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging datasets.

Result: TCL improves model performance and speeds up training, addressing slow training in complex models.

Conclusion: The TCL framework effectively enhances sequence labeling tasks by optimizing training efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Sequence labeling models often benefit from incorporating external knowledge. However, this practice introduces data heterogeneity and complicates the model with additional modules, leading to increased expenses for training a high-performing model. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning (TCL) framework specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks. The TCL framework enhances training by gradually introducing data instances from easy to hard, aiming to improve both performance and training speed. Furthermore, we explore different metrics for assessing the difficulty levels of sequence labeling tasks. Through extensive experimentation on six Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and Part-of-speech tagging (POS) datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in enhancing the performance of sequence labeling models. Additionally, our analysis indicates that TCL accelerates training and alleviates the slow training problem associated with complex models.

Motivation: Large language models struggle with formal math theorem proving due to limited training data in formal languages like Lean.

Method: Proposes an iterative pipeline to generate and filter synthetic data for translating natural language math problems into Lean 4 and vice versa.

Result: The pipeline produces 57K formal-informal question pairs and improves LLM performance in math problem translation and understanding.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation is effective for enhancing LLMs' capabilities in formal math tasks, with open-sourced code and data.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, especially in solving mathematical problems.

To address this issue, we propose a novel pipeline that iteratively generates and filters synthetic data to translate natural language mathematical problems into Lean 4 statements, and vice versa. Our results indicate that the synthetic data pipeline can provide useful training data and improve the performance of LLMs in translating and understanding complex mathematical problems and proofs. Our final dataset contains about 57K formal-informal question pairs along with searched proof from the math contest forum and 21 new IMO questions.

Abstract: Comprehensive monolingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) surveys are essential for assessing language-specific challenges, resource availability, and research gaps. However, existing surveys often lack standardized methodologies, leading to selection bias and fragmented coverage of NLP tasks and resources. This study introduces a generalizable framework for systematic monolingual NLP surveys. Our approach integrates a structured search protocol to minimize bias, an NLP task taxonomy for classification, and language resource taxonomies to identify potential benchmarks and highlight opportunities for improving resource availability. We apply this framework to Greek NLP (2012-2023), providing an in-depth analysis of its current state, task-specific progress, and resource gaps. The survey results are publicly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15314882) and are regularly updated to provide an evergreen resource. This systematic survey of Greek NLP serves as a case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and its potential for broader application to other not so well-resourced languages as regards NLP.

TL;DR: A framework for anonymizing text against LLM-based re-identification, balancing privacy and data utility, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of anonymizing sensitive text while preserving utility, especially against advanced LLM re-identification.

Method: Proposes a framework with three LLM-based components: privacy evaluator, utility evaluator, and optimization, tested via experiments.

Result: Outperforms baselines, reducing re-identification risk while maintaining data utility, with studies on core modules and lightweight model distillation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances privacy and utility, with potential for large-scale applications; code and datasets will be public.

Abstract: Anonymizing text that contains sensitive information is crucial for a wide range of applications. Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of the re-identification ability of large language models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and reasoning over dispersed pieces of patterns to draw conclusions. When defending against LLM-based re-identification, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks. In general, the interaction between anonymization and data utility requires a deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework composed of three key LLM-based components: a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks. We provide detailed studies on these core modules. To consider large-scale and real-time applications, we investigate the distillation of the anonymization capabilities into lightweight models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of LLMs generating outdated or inaccurate information by leveraging real-time, domain-specific data retrieval for improved accuracy in radiology.

Method: Developed RadioRAG to retrieve real-time data from Radiopaedia. Evaluated LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama3) with and without RadioRAG on 104 radiology questions, comparing accuracy and human performance.

Result: RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy by up to 54% for some LLMs, matching or exceeding non-RAG models and human radiologists, especially in breast imaging and emergency radiology. Variability in improvement was observed across models.

Conclusion: RadioRAG enhances LLM accuracy in radiology by integrating real-time domain-specific data, demonstrating its potential to improve factuality in specialized fields.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from Radiopaedia in real-time. Accuracy was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. RadioRAG shows potential to improve LLM accuracy and factuality in radiology question answering by integrating real-time domain-specific data.

*Xinyi Zeng, Yuying Shang, Jiawei Chen, Jingyuan Zhang, Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decoder-oriented defense mechanism for LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs by correcting queries step-by-step, enhancing security without sacrificing speed or helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for addressing harmful outputs in LLMs are limited by ineffective prefill-level judgments and single-evaluation rejections, which reduce model robustness and helpfulness.

Method: The authors design a step-by-step defense architecture at the decoding level, using speculative decoding to correct harmful queries directly and improve secure decoding speed.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method enhances model security while maintaining reasoning speed and helpfulness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed decoder-oriented defense effectively leverages LLMs' ability to recognize harmful outputs, offering a robust solution without compromising usability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its helpfulness compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAP2PAT, a benchmark for patent drafting using LLMs, addressing the challenge of generating detailed patent descriptions from research papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent drafting is time-intensive, and LLMs' potential in this area is understudied, especially due to confidentiality of invention reports (IRs).

Method: The authors propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using research papers as IRs, creating an open benchmark (PAP2PAT) with 1.8k patent-paper pairs.

Result: LLMs can leverage paper information but struggle with detail. Fine-tuning improves patent-style language but increases hallucination.

Conclusion: The work highlights LLMs' promise in patent drafting but notes challenges in detail and hallucination, releasing data and code for further research.

Abstract: Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code https://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.

TL;DR: MathNeuro isolates math-specific parameters in LLMs using forward passes, improving math performance without affecting general language abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how math reasoning is encoded in LLMs and isolating it could improve targeted interventions and model understanding.

Method: MathNeuro uses weights and activations to identify math-specific parameters, filtering out those for general language tasks. Pruning or scaling these parameters alters math performance.

Result: Scaling identified parameters improves math performance by 4-35% on benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH) without affecting non-math behavior. MathNeuro is data-efficient, working with a single sample.

Conclusion: MathNeuro demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and intervening on math-specific parameters in LLMs, opening avenues for future research.

Abstract: Math reasoning is an active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence and has implications in several domains, including math education. However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly impacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered. MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of language models in handling interchangeable tokens (e.g., bound variables) and introduces alpha-covariance to evaluate robustness. A dual-part token embedding strategy improves generalization and alpha-equivalence recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle with interchangeable tokens, hindering generalization and alpha-equivalence recognition, which is crucial for formal reasoning.

Method: Proposes a dual-part token embedding: a shared component for semantic consistency and a randomized component for token distinguishability. Evaluated on logic tasks and vocabulary extension.

Result: Outperforms baseline using alpha-renaming for data augmentation, showing better generalization and inductive bias for alpha-equivalence.

Conclusion: The approach lays groundwork for models to learn interchangeable token representations, advancing systematic reasoning in formal domains.

Abstract: Language models lack the notion of interchangeable tokens: symbols that are semantically equivalent yet distinct, such as bound variables in formal logic. This limitation prevents generalization to larger vocabularies and hinders the model's ability to recognize alpha-equivalence, where renaming bound variables preserves meaning. We formalize this machine learning problem and introduce alpha-covariance, a metric for evaluating robustness to such transformations. To tackle this task, we propose a dual-part token embedding strategy: a shared component ensures semantic consistency, while a randomized component maintains token distinguishability. Compared to a baseline that relies on alpha-renaming for data augmentation, our approach demonstrates improved generalization to unseen tokens in linear temporal logic solving, propositional logic assignment prediction, and copying with an extendable vocabulary, while introducing a favorable inductive bias for alpha-equivalence. Our findings establish a foundation for designing language models that can learn interchangeable token representations, a crucial step toward more flexible and systematic reasoning in formal domains.

Abstract: We create two German-only decoder models, LLäMmlein 120M and 1B, transparently from scratch and publish them, along with the training data, for the German NLP research community to use. The model training involved several key steps, including extensive data preprocessing, the creation of a custom German tokenizer, the training itself, as well as the evaluation of the final models on various benchmarks. Throughout the training process, multiple checkpoints were saved and analyzed using the SuperGLEBer benchmark to monitor the models' learning dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art models on the SuperGLEBer benchmark, both LLäMmlein models performed competitively, consistently matching or surpassing models with similar parameter sizes. The results show that the models' quality scales with size as expected, but performance improvements on some tasks plateaued early, offering valuable insights into resource allocation for future model development.

TL;DR: REVOLVE is an adaptive optimization method for LLM systems that tracks response evolution over iterations, outperforming baselines with significant improvements in prompt optimization, solution refinement, and code optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing LLM-based systems for specific tasks is challenging due to reliance on manual interventions and limited immediate feedback methods.

Method: REVOLVE tracks how responses evolve across iterations, enabling stable and effective optimization through progressive adjustments.

Result: REVOLVE achieves a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, 20.72% in solution refinement, and 29.17% in code optimization, with faster convergence.

Conclusion: REVOLVE demonstrates the potential of leveraging optimization principles to enhance LLM systems, paving the way for further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However, relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly, potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how "R"esponses "EVOLVE" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a 29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. Beyond its practical contributions, REVOLVE highlights a promising direction, where the rich knowledge from established optimization principles can be leveraged to enhance LLM systems, which paves the way for further advancements in this hybrid domain.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to automate literature reviews, focusing on reference generation, summarization, and composition, revealing issues like hallucinated references and performance variability across disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in automating literature review tasks, given their increasing use in academia.

Method: A framework with multidimensional metrics evaluates LLMs on hallucination rates, semantic coverage, and factual consistency in reference generation, summaries, and review compositions.

Result: Advanced LLMs still produce hallucinated references, and performance varies by discipline, indicating limitations in reliability.

Conclusion: Further research is needed to enhance LLMs' reliability for automating academic literature reviews.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to automate the complex processes involved in writing literature reviews, such as literature collection, organization, and summarization. However, it is yet unclear how good LLMs are at automating comprehensive and reliable literature reviews. This study introduces a framework to automatically evaluate the performance of LLMs in three key tasks of literature writing: reference generation, literature summary, and literature review composition. We introduce multidimensional evaluation metrics that assess the hallucination rates in generated references and measure the semantic coverage and factual consistency of the literature summaries and compositions against human-written counterparts. The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress. Moreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across disciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews. These findings highlight the need for further research and development to improve the reliability of LLMs in automating academic literature reviews.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation methods in AI-based clinical coding, highlighting misalignment with real-world practice, and offers recommendations for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual clinical coding is labor-intensive and error-prone, driving the need for automation, but current AI research lacks practical alignment.

Method: Analysis of US English electronic health records and automated coding research, identifying gaps in evaluation methods.

Result: Current evaluations oversimplify by focusing on common codes, ignoring thousands of practical codes. Eight recommendations are proposed to improve alignment.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for better evaluation methods and suggests AI-based alternatives to assist, not replace, clinical coders.

Abstract: Clinical coding is crucial for healthcare billing and data analysis. Manual clinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated research towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based on US English electronic health records and automated coding research using these records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with real clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely with practical challenges of clinical coding. Based on our analysis, we offer eight specific recommendations, suggesting ways to improve current evaluation methods. Additionally, we propose new AI-based methods beyond automated coding, suggesting alternative approaches to assist clinical coders in their workflows.

Our study spans two open-source and two proprietary state-of-the-art models. Results reveal that LLM-generated questions tend to demand longer descriptive answers and exhibit more evenly distributed context focus, in contrast to the positional bias often seen in QA tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning through Perspective Transition (RPT), a method for LLMs to dynamically switch perspectives (direct, role, or third-person) to improve performance on subjective tasks. It outperforms fixed-perspective methods like chain-of-thought prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with subjective tasks where perspective matters. The paper aims to enhance their performance by enabling dynamic perspective selection.

Method: Proposes RPT, an in-context learning method for LLMs to dynamically choose perspectives (direct, role, third-person) based on the task.

Result: RPT outperforms fixed-perspective methods (e.g., chain-of-thought) across 12 subjective tasks using models like GPT-4 and Llama-3.

Conclusion: Dynamic perspective selection (RPT) enables LLMs to provide nuanced, contextually appropriate responses for diverse subjective problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling remarkable progress in various tasks. Different from objective tasks such as commonsense reasoning and arithmetic question-answering, the performance of LLMs on subjective tasks is still limited, where the perspective on the specific problem plays crucial roles for better interpreting the context and giving proper response. For example, in certain scenarios, LLMs may perform better when answering from an expert role perspective, potentially eliciting their relevant domain knowledge. In contrast, in some scenarios, LLMs may provide more accurate responses when answering from a third-person standpoint, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potentially mitigating inherent biases. In this paper, we propose Reasoning through Perspective Transition (RPT), a method based on in-context learning that enables LLMs to dynamically select among direct, role, and third-person perspectives for the best way to solve corresponding subjective problem. Through extensive experiments on totally 12 subjective tasks by using both closed-source and open-source LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama-3, and Qwen-2, our method outperforms widely used single fixed perspective based methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and expert prompting, highlights the intricate ways that LLMs can adapt their perspectives to provide nuanced and contextually appropriate responses for different problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS) to improve LLM-based agents' code generation diversity and quality, outperforming existing AutoML agents by 6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents face issues with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation, and current MCTS methods have limitations in thought quality and feedback mechanisms.

Method: The proposed I-MCTS iteratively refines tree nodes by introspectively analyzing parent and sibling solutions, integrates an LLM-based value model for node evaluation, and uses a hybrid rewarding mechanism for Q-value transition.

Result: I-MCTS achieves a 6% absolute performance improvement over strong open-source AutoML agents in various ML tasks.

Conclusion: I-MCTS effectively enhances LLM-based AutoML systems by improving decision-making and solution quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in automating machine learning tasks. However, existing LLM-based agents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While recent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these issues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated, as well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In this study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a novel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective process that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and sibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the search tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process. Furthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to facilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting comprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is implemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to actual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed earlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 6% absolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML agents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.

TL;DR: CODESYNC is a data engine for tracking outdated code patterns and updating real-time code knowledge from Python libraries. CODESYNCBENCH is a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' adaptability to code evolution, revealing their struggles despite advanced methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with adapting to evolving code knowledge, especially third-party library updates, leading to non-executable or inefficient code.

Method: Introduces CODESYNC for real-time code updates and CODESYNCBENCH, a benchmark with 3,300 test cases and 2,200 training samples, evaluating 14 LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform poorly with dynamic code evolution, even with advanced updating methods like DPO, ORPO, and SimPO.

Conclusion: CODESYNCBENCH provides a foundation for developing better real-time code knowledge updating methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance in software engineering yet face challenges in adapting to continually evolving code knowledge, particularly regarding the frequent updates of third-party library APIs. This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets, often results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety and efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for identifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge updates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop CODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay synchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs from six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three evaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of 2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of advanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe that our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more effective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCSQE is a framework to reduce distribution shift in synthetic QE data by improving translation diversity and using references for better token-level labels, outperforming SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the distribution shift in synthetic QE data, which arises from discrepancies between pseudo and real translations or misaligned pseudo labels.

Method: Uses constrained beam search and diverse generation models to reduce translation differences, references for token-level labels, and mimics human annotation for phrase-level labels.

Result: DCSQE outperforms SOTA baselines like CometKiwi in supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: DCSQE effectively mitigates distribution shift in synthetic QE data, with potential applications for reward models in other tasks.

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) models evaluate the quality of machine translations without reference translations, serving as the reward models for the translation task. Due to the data scarcity, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution. However, synthetic QE data often suffers from distribution shift, which can manifest as discrepancies between pseudo and real translations, or in pseudo labels that do not align with human preferences. To tackle this issue, we introduce DCSQE, a novel framework for alleviating distribution shift in synthetic QE data. To reduce the difference between pseudo and real translations, we employ the constrained beam search algorithm and enhance translation diversity through the use of distinct generation models. DCSQE uses references, i.e., translation supervision signals, to guide both the generation and annotation processes, enhancing the quality of token-level labels. DCSQE further identifies the shortest phrase covering consecutive error tokens, mimicking human annotation behavior, to assign the final phrase-level labels. Specially, we underscore that the translation model can not annotate translations of itself accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCSQE outperforms SOTA baselines like CometKiwi in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Further analysis offers insights into synthetic data generation that could benefit reward models for other tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/njuqe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PsychBench is a benchmarking system to evaluate LLMs in psychiatric settings, revealing their potential and limitations, particularly as supportive tools for junior psychiatrists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a robust framework to assess LLMs in psychiatric clinical environments, hindering specialized model development.

Method: Proposed PsychBench, evaluated 16 LLMs, analyzed prompt design, reasoning, text length, and fine-tuning, and conducted a clinical reader study with 60 psychiatrists.

Result: LLMs show promise but are inadequate for clinical decision-making; they notably support junior psychiatrists by improving efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: PsychBench highlights LLMs' potential in psychiatry, especially for junior practitioners, and aims to advance research by making data and framework public.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solutions to address problems such as shortage of medical resources and low diagnostic consistency in psychiatric clinical practice. Despite this potential, a robust and comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in authentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the advancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In response to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and clinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the practical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and investigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input text length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance. Through detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential limitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement. Subsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying seniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing LLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the quantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models demonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making tools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates that, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for junior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall clinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset and evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the application of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings.

*José Pombal, Nuno M. Guerreiro, Ricardo Rei, André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses metric interference (MINT) in machine learning, where using the same or related metrics for tuning and evaluation leads to overoptimistic performance estimates. It introduces MINTADJUST, a method to improve evaluation reliability under MINT, showing superior results on the WMT24 MT task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of unintentionally gaming metrics during model development due to MINT, which distorts performance estimates and reduces correlation with human judgments.

Method: Analysis of MINT in machine translation tasks (training data filtering and decoding with quality signals) and proposal of MINTADJUST for reliable evaluation.

Result: MINTADJUST outperforms state-of-the-art metrics and AUTORANK on the WMT24 MT test set, especially for high-quality systems.

Conclusion: MINTADJUST provides a more accurate evaluation method under MINT, addressing the limitations of current metric-based evaluation strategies.

Abstract: As automatic metrics become increasingly stronger and widely adopted, the risk of unintentionally "gaming the metric" during model development rises. This issue is caused by metric interference (MINT), i.e., the use of the same or related metrics for both model tuning and evaluation. MINT can misguide practitioners into being overoptimistic about the performance of their systems: as system outputs become a function of the interfering metric, their estimated quality loses correlation with human judgments. In this work, we analyze two common cases of MINT in machine translation-related tasks: filtering of training data, and decoding with quality signals. Importantly, we find that MINT strongly distorts instance-level metric scores, even when metrics are not directly optimized for-questioning the common strategy of leveraging a different, yet related metric for evaluation that is not used for tuning. To address this problem, we propose MINTADJUST, a method for more reliable evaluation under MINT. On the WMT24 MT shared task test set, MINTADJUST ranks translations and systems more accurately than state-of-the-art metrics across a majority of language pairs, especially for high-quality systems. Furthermore, MINTADJUST outperforms AUTORANK, the ensembling method used by the organizers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes iterative and neighbor-assisted model editing to improve LLM knowledge updates, reducing UnderEdit by 38% and OverEdit by 6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in LLM knowledge updates via retraining/fine-tuning, and limitations of existing model editing methods (UnderEdit and OverEdit).

Method: Introduces iterative model editing (successive edits) and neighbor-assisted model editing (incorporates neighboring knowledge).

Result: Improves editing performance across LLMs, reducing UnderEdit by 38% and OverEdit by 6%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance model editing efficiency and effectiveness, applicable to any locate-and-edit approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in downstream tasks, but keeping their knowledge up-to-date via retraining or fine-tuning is often computationally expensive. Model editing provides a more efficient alternative by updating a targeted subset of parameters, which often follows the locate-and-edit paradigm. Despite this efficiency, existing methods are limited: edits may fail to inject knowledge (UnderEdit) or unintentionally disrupt unrelated neighboring knowledge (OverEdit). To address these challenges, we propose two complementary methods: iterative model editing, which applies successive edits to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to reduce OverEdit. Our extensive experiments show that these techniques improve editing performance across multiple LLMs, algorithms, and benchmarks, reducing UnderEdit by up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit by up to 6, while remaining broadly applicable to any locate-and-edit method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI Taiyan, a specialized large language model for Classical Chinese, outperforming general and traditional models in tasks like punctuation, translation, and word explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose models underperform in specialized domains like Classical Chinese, and fine-tuning struggles with domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Developed AI Taiyan with 1.8B parameters through tailored model design, data processing, foundational training, and fine-tuning.

Result: AI Taiyan excels in Classical Chinese tasks, surpassing general and traditional models, and nears human performance.

Conclusion: The study offers a blueprint for efficient domain-specific model development and showcases applications in ancient text collation and research.

Abstract: General-purpose large language models demonstrate notable capabilities in language comprehension and generation, achieving results that are comparable to, or even surpass, human performance in many natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, when general models are applied to some specific domains, e.g., Classical Chinese texts, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory, and fine-tuning open-source foundational models similarly struggles to adequately incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, this study developed a large language model, AI Taiyan, specifically designed for understanding and generating Classical Chinese. Experiments show that with a reasonable model design, data processing, foundational training, and fine-tuning, satisfactory results can be achieved with only 1.8 billion parameters. In key tasks related to language processing of Classical Chinese such as punctuation, identification of allusions, explanation of word meanings, and translation between ancient and modern Chinese, this model exhibits a clear advantage over both general-purpose large models and domain-specific traditional models, achieving levels close to or surpassing human baselines. This research provides a reference for the efficient construction of specialized domain-specific large language models. Furthermore, the paper discusses the application of this model in fields such as the collation of ancient texts, dictionary editing, and language research, combined with case studies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-trained judge model (J4R) to improve evaluation of LLM outputs in reasoning-intensive domains, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-as-judge models struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks, prompting the need for a more robust evaluation method.

Method: Proposes EIS-GRPO algorithm to train judges, introduces ReasoningJudgeBench, and develops J4R, a 7B judge model.

Result: J4R outperforms GPT-4o and other small judges by 6.7% and 9%, matching larger models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses limitations of current judge models, demonstrating superior performance in reasoning evaluations.

Abstract: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM) development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains, like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning (RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3) We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and ReasoningJudgeBench.

Motivation: To assess LLMs' performance on legal questions requiring citations and case facts, addressing challenges in free-text evaluation.

Method: Developed GreekBarBench with a three-dimensional scoring system and LLM-as-a-judge approach, plus a meta-evaluation benchmark for alignment.

Result: Best LLMs outperform average expert scores but do not reach the 95th percentile of human experts.

Conclusion: Simple, span-based rubrics improve LLM-judge alignment, but LLMs still lag behind top human experts.

Abstract: We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal questions across five different legal areas from the Greek Bar exams, requiring citations to statutory articles and case facts. To tackle the challenges of free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations, revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the 95th percentile of experts.

Result: SLMs achieve competitive performance with fewer redundant reasoning steps.

Conclusion: The method effectively distills long CoT reasoning into SLMs, improving efficiency and maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

TL;DR: ALPS is a method to efficiently align LLMs by localizing and pruning task-sensitive attention heads, reducing training costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and data dependency in aligning LLMs to downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes ALPS, which localizes and prunes task-sensitive attention heads, restricting updates to these heads.

Result: Activates only 10% of attention parameters, achieving a 2% performance boost on three tasks, with transferable heads.

Conclusion: ALPS offers a novel, efficient approach to LLM alignment, reducing costs and improving generalization.

Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks often incurs significant training adjustment costs. Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy (ALPS), an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only 10% of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a 2% performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Avengers method combines smaller open-source models using embedding, clustering, scoring, and voting to outperform proprietary models like GPT-4 variants across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that smaller open-source models can compete with proprietary giants by leveraging collective intelligence.

Method: Uses embedding, clustering, scoring, and voting to select and combine the best-performing models for each query.

Result: Surpasses GPT-4 variants in average performance across 15 datasets, with notable gains in mathematics (18.21%) and coding (7.46%).

Conclusion: The Avengers method proves smaller models can outperform larger proprietary ones through strategic ensemble techniques.

Abstract: Proprietary giants are increasingly dominating the race for ever-larger language models. Can open-source, smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers -- a simple recipe that leverages the collective intelligence of these smaller models. The Avengers builds upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response with repeated sampling. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers surpasses GPT-4o, 4.1, and 4.5 in average performance across 15 diverse datasets spanning mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, general knowledge, and affective tasks. In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter -- the number of clusters.

*Valentin Knappich, Annemarie Friedrich, Anna Hätty, Simon Razniewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEDANTIC, a dataset of 14k US patent claims annotated for indefiniteness, using an automated pipeline with LLMs for annotation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in patent claims lead to frequent rejections, but no annotated dataset exists for automating definiteness examination.

Method: Constructed PEDANTIC using an automated pipeline with LLMs to extract indefiniteness reasons from USPTO documents, validated by humans. Evaluated models using LLM-as-Judge for free-form reasoning comparison.

Result: LLM agents (Qwen 2.5 32B/72B) did not outperform logistic regression in definiteness prediction, despite identifying correct reasons.

Conclusion: PEDANTIC is a valuable resource for patent AI research, enabling advanced examination models; dataset and code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C § 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to estimate model capacity by separating memorization into unintended memorization and generalization, finding GPT-style models have ~3.6 bits/parameter capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle memorization from generalization in language models and measure their capacity.

Method: Formally separates memorization into unintended memorization and generalization, trains models on varying dataset sizes, and observes memorization behavior.

Result: Estimates GPT-style models have ~3.6 bits/parameter capacity; memorization decreases as models generalize ('grokking').

Conclusion: Provides scaling laws for model capacity and data size, linking them to membership inference.

Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model knows about a datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two components: unintended memorization, the information a model contains about a specific dataset, and generalization, the information a model contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until their capacity fills, at which point "grokking" begins, and unintended memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to membership inference.

*Sifan Li, Yujun Cai, Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HC-Bench reveals VLMs' near-zero accuracy in detecting hidden content. SemVink, a simple scaling method, achieves >99% accuracy, highlighting VLMs' architectural flaw in prioritizing semantics over low-level vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address VLMs' failure in detecting hidden content, a core human capability, and propose a solution for real-world robustness.

Method: Introduce HC-Bench with 112 hidden-content images. Propose SemVink, scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels) to eliminate noise.

Result: VLMs score 0-5.36% accuracy on HC-Bench, while SemVink achieves >99%.

Conclusion: VLMs' overreliance on high-level semantics is a flaw. Hybrid models with multi-scale processing are needed for robustness.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

*Ho Yin 'Sam' Ng, Ting-Yao Hsu, Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan, Branislav Kveton, Nedim Lipka, Franck Dernoncourt, Dongwon Lee, Tong Yu, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A. Rossi, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap is a dataset for personalized figure caption generation using multimodal profiles, improving caption quality by leveraging context from related figures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated captions lack personalization and often require manual revision. Current methods focus on text-only settings, ignoring multimodal inputs and profiles.

Method: LaMP-Cap introduces a dataset with multimodal figure profiles, including images, captions, and figure-mentioning paragraphs from the same document. Four LLMs are tested to evaluate the impact of profile information.

Result: Using profile information improves caption quality, making them closer to author-written ones. Images in profiles are more helpful than text-only context.

Conclusion: Multimodal profiles enhance personalized caption generation, with images playing a key role, outperforming text-only approaches.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIEFME, a dataset for evaluating language models in legal brief tasks like summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. While LLMs excel in summarization and guided completion, they struggle with realistic argument completion and case retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored area of legal brief writing in Legal NLP and evaluate language models' ability to assist in legal tasks.

Method: Creation of the BRIEFME dataset with three tasks: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. Analysis of current LLM performance on these tasks.

Result: LLMs perform well on summarization and guided completion but poorly on realistic argument completion and case retrieval.

Conclusion: The BRIEFME dataset aims to advance Legal NLP by highlighting areas where LLMs need improvement to better assist legal professionals.

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges. To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases. We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will specifically aid people in performing legal work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover reasoning biases in LLMs by introducing logically valid but belief-inconsistent syllogisms, addressing gaps in prior datasets.

Method: Benchmarking state-of-the-art models (GPT, Claude, Japanese LLMs) on BIS Reasoning 1.0, focusing on belief-inconsistent problems.

Result: GPT-4o achieved 79.54% accuracy, with significant variance in performance across models, exposing weaknesses in handling belief-conflicting inputs.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need for improved LLM reasoning in high-stakes domains where truth must override intuitive beliefs.

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and safety.

TL;DR: NoWait, a method disabling explicit self-reflection tokens like 'Wait' and 'Hmm', reduces reasoning trajectory length by 27%-51% without losing utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overthinking and redundancy in large reasoning models by questioning the necessity of explicit self-reflection.

Method: Propose NoWait, which suppresses self-reflection tokens during inference.

Result: Reduces chain-of-thought length by 27%-51% across 10 benchmarks, preserving utility.

Conclusion: NoWait is a plug-and-play solution for efficient, utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual, visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: Router-R1 is an RL-based framework for multi-LLM routing, outperforming single-round routers by dynamically invoking and aggregating multiple LLMs for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routers limit performance by assigning queries to a single model, failing to leverage complementary strengths of multiple LLMs for complex tasks.

Method: Router-R1 uses RL to frame routing as a sequential process, interleaving deliberation and dynamic model invocation, with rewards for format, outcome, and cost.

Result: Router-R1 outperforms baselines on QA benchmarks, achieving better performance, generalization, and cost efficiency.

Conclusion: Router-R1 demonstrates the potential of RL-based multi-LLM routing for complex tasks, balancing performance and cost effectively.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Unified RoPE, a method to integrate Transformers and SSMs by unifying their positional encoding mechanisms, leading to faster and more accurate hybrid models like TransXSSM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of integrating Transformers and SSMs due to incompatible positional encoding mechanisms (RoPE vs. implicit convolutions) leads to performance issues.

Method: Introduces Unified RoPE for consistent positional encoding and TransXSSM, a hybrid architecture combining Transformers and SSMs under this scheme.

Result: TransXSSM is 42.3% faster in training and 29.5% faster in inference at 4K sequence length, with over 4% higher accuracy on benchmarks. Scaling also improves (7.22% gain for 1.3B model).

Conclusion: Unified positional encoding resolves incompatibility, enabling efficient and high-performance long-context modeling in hybrid architectures.

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies, whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling. Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a fundamental incongr inuity their respective positional encoding mechanisms: Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance.To address this impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (Unified RoPE) methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this Unified RoPE, we introduce TransXSSM, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a 4 sequenceK length, TransXSSM exhibits training and inference speeds that are 42.3% and 29.5% faster, respectively, relative to standard Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4% on language modeling benchmarks.TransXSSM furthermore scales more effectively: TransXSSM-1.3B gains 7.22% in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6% gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

TL;DR: DMAO is an architecture optimization framework that uses a grow-and-drop strategy to reallocate parameters during training, improving efficiency without significant overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for architecture design are either manual (requiring expertise) or automated (computationally expensive). DMAO aims to balance efficiency and automation.

Method: DMAO employs a grow-and-drop strategy to dynamically reallocate parameters from less-utilized to more beneficial areas during training.

Result: Experiments show DMAO improves WER by up to 6% across various architectures and datasets, with negligible training overhead.

Conclusion: DMAO effectively optimizes architecture design by dynamically redistributing parameters, offering a practical and efficient solution.

Abstract: Architecture design is inherently complex. Existing approaches rely on either handcrafted rules, which demand extensive empirical expertise, or automated methods like neural architecture search, which are computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce DMAO, an architecture optimization framework that employs a grow-and-drop strategy to automatically reallocate parameters during training. This reallocation shifts resources from less-utilized areas to those parts of the model where they are most beneficial. Notably, DMAO only introduces negligible training overhead at a given model complexity. We evaluate DMAO through experiments with CTC on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2 and Switchboard datasets. The results show that, using the same amount of training resources, our proposed DMAO consistently improves WER by up to 6% relatively across various architectures, model sizes, and datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the pattern of parameter redistribution and uncover insightful findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage CRC framework to improve consistency between generated responses and dialogue contexts in goal-oriented dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research focused on optimizing goal-oriented paths but ignored inconsistencies between responses and dialogue contexts.

Method: A model-agnostic two-stage framework (CRC) is proposed: (1) reflection stage identifies inconsistencies, and (2) correction stage generates context-consistent responses.

Result: Experiments on multiple models (BART, T5, GPT-2, etc.) and datasets show CRC significantly improves response consistency.

Conclusion: The CRC framework effectively addresses inconsistencies in goal-oriented dialogue systems, enhancing response quality.

Abstract: Goal-oriented proactive dialogue systems are designed to guide user conversations seamlessly towards specific objectives by planning a goal-oriented path. However, previous research has focused predominantly on optimizing these paths while neglecting the inconsistencies that may arise between generated responses and dialogue contexts, including user profiles, dialogue history, domain knowledge, and subgoals. To address this issue, we introduce a model-agnostic two-stage Consistency Reflection and Correction (CRC) framework. Specifically, in the consistency reflection stage, the model is prompted to reflect on the discrepancies between generated responses and dialogue contexts, identifying inconsistencies and suggesting possible corrections. In the consistency correction stage, the model generates responses that are more consistent with the dialogue context based on these reflection results. We conducted experiments on various model architectures with different parameter sizes, including encoder-decoder models (BART, T5) and decoder-only models (GPT-2, DialoGPT, Phi3, Mistral and LLaMA3), and the experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our CRC framework significantly improves the consistency between generated responses and dialogue contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models rely solely on labeled human preference data. The paper explores using both labeled and unlabeled data to improve reward model training.

Method: Develops a generative reward model trained via unsupervised learning and fine-tuned with supervised learning, using label smoothing to optimize a regularized pairwise ranking loss.

Result: The model generalizes well across tasks like response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The generative reward model provides a versatile foundation for various tasks, reducing the need for further fine-tuning and improving performance.

Abstract: In aligning large language models (LLMs), reward models have played an important role, but are standardly trained as discriminative models and rely only on labeled human preference data. In this paper, we explore methods that train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks, including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements over several strong baseline models.

TL;DR: Thunder-NUBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' understanding of sentence-level negation, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks treat negation as a side case, lacking focus on deep semantic understanding of negation.

Method: Thunder-NUBench includes manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset, contrasting standard negation with diverse alternatives.

Result: The benchmark enables in-depth evaluation of models' negation understanding.

Conclusion: Thunder-NUBench fills a gap by providing a dedicated tool for assessing negation comprehension in LLMs.

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that poses persistent challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring deep semantic understanding. Existing benchmarks often treat negation as a side case within broader tasks like natural language inference, resulting in a lack of benchmarks that exclusively target negation understanding. In this work, we introduce Thunder-NUBench, a novel benchmark explicitly designed to assess sentence-level negation understanding in LLMs. Thunder-NUBench goes beyond surface-level cue detection by contrasting standard negation with structurally diverse alternatives such as local negation, contradiction, and paraphrase. The benchmark consists of manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset that enables in-depth evaluation of models' negation understanding.

TL;DR: A framework synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collective consensus, fine-tuning misaligned models to improve moral reasoning consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies in LLMs' moral reasoning when faced with complex dilemmas.

Method: Aggregate moral acceptability scores into a collective probability, fine-tune misaligned models via embedding optimization.

Result: Improved consensus and individual model fidelity on moral dilemmas.

Conclusion: Data-driven moral alignment enhances AI safety and consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive moral reasoning abilities. Yet they often diverge when confronted with complex, multi-factor moral dilemmas. To address these discrepancies, we propose a framework that synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collectively formulated moral judgment, realigning models that deviate significantly from this consensus. Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability. For misaligned models, a targeted embedding-optimization procedure fine-tunes token embeddings for moral philosophical theories, minimizing JS divergence to the consensus while preserving semantic integrity. Experiments on a large-scale social moral dilemma dataset show our approach builds robust consensus and improves individual model fidelity.

*Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Bernd Weiß, Jessica Daikeler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show potential for coding open-ended survey responses, but performance varies by model and prompting approach. Fine-tuning is often needed for satisfactory results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs in coding non-English, complex survey responses and compare their performance to established methods.

Method: Evaluated several LLMs and prompting approaches using German survey data, comparing results to human expert codings.

Result: Performance varied widely among LLMs; only fine-tuned models achieved high accuracy. Prompting effectiveness depended on the LLM.

Conclusion: LLMs can be useful but require careful selection and fine-tuning. The study highlights trade-offs in automated coding methods.

Abstract: The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and robust reasoning model that matches SOTA performance while using fewer parameters.

Method: Joint training pipeline combining distillation and RL, with C3PO for stability and a two-stage approach for multi-domain data.

Result: Matches SOTA performance on benchmarks (AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) with one-third the parameters.

Conclusion: Ring-lite demonstrates efficient reasoning via RL and MoE, with novel training methods and multi-domain integration.

Abstract: We present Ring-lite, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language model optimized via reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and robust reasoning capabilities. Built upon the publicly available Ling-lite model, a 16.8 billion parameter model with 2.75 billion activated parameters, our approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-scale reasoning models on challenging benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) while activating only one-third of the parameters required by comparable models. To accomplish this, we introduce a joint training pipeline integrating distillation with RL, revealing undocumented challenges in MoE RL training. First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology. Second, we empirically demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training. Finally, we develop a two-stage training paradigm to harmonize multi-domain data integration, addressing domain conflicts that arise in training with mixed dataset. We will release the model, dataset, and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent and modular system for monitoring animal populations by integrating visual data and natural language queries, addressing the limitations of black-box models.

Method: ViLLa integrates three components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their locations, a language parser for understanding queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer for logic-based inference.

Result: The system effectively answers queries like 'How many dogs are in the scene?' or 'Where is the buffalo?' by grounding visual detections into symbolic facts and applying predefined rules.

Conclusion: ViLLa successfully bridges visual content with structured queries, offering interpretability and modularity compared to end-to-end black-box models.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphGSOcc, a framework combining semantic and geometric graph Transformers for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, addressing feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities in 3DGS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues in existing 3DGS methods: poor semantic correlation handling and boundary ambiguities due to lack of geometric constraints.

Method: Proposes Dual Gaussians Graph Attention for dynamic geometric and semantic graph construction, coupled with Multi-scale Graph Attention for fine and coarse-grained feature optimization.

Result: Achieves 24.10% mIoU on SurroundOcc dataset with 1.97% improvement and 13.7% memory reduction (6.1 GB).

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc effectively improves semantic occupancy prediction by integrating semantic and geometric constraints, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNeRV improves video compression using multi-scale feature fusion, outperforming VTM-23.7 in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based methods fail to handle detail-intensive and fast-changing video content due to underutilized network features and lack of video-specific design.

Method: Proposes MSNeRV with temporal windows for consistency, GoP-level grids for background, and a multi-scale spatial decoder with adaptive loss. Introduces multi-scale feature blocks for better extraction.

Result: Superior representation and compression efficiency compared to INR-based methods and VTM-23.7 in dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: MSNeRV addresses INR limitations and enhances video compression performance.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated videos necessitates reliable detection methods with clear evidence, beyond binary classification, to convince users and auditors.

Method: DAVID-X dataset pairs AI-generated videos with defect-level annotations and rationales. DAVID-XR1, a video-language model, uses these for interpretable reasoning, including defect categorization and explanations.

Result: The model, fine-tuned on DAVID-X and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, generalizes well across various generators and modes.

Conclusion: Explainable detection methods like DAVID-XR1 offer trustworthy identification of AI-generated content, transforming detection into a transparent process.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms, the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However, the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ME analysis methods treat spotting and recognition separately, which is suboptimal for real-world applications. Multimodal models offer improved capabilities.

Method: Two tasks are proposed: ME-STR (unified spotting and recognition) and ME-VQA (visual question answering using MLLMs/LVLMs).

Result: The MEGC 2025 challenge will evaluate algorithms on these tasks, with results submitted to a leaderboard.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of multimodal models for advancing ME analysis and introduces standardized tasks for future research.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in video captioning with competitive results in video QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Motivation: Existing document pre-trained models lack effective interaction between vision and language, limiting generalization and accuracy.

Method: Proposes Bi-VLDoc with bidirectional supervision and hybrid-attention to explore vision-language interactions.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Form Understanding (85.14% to 93.44%), Receipt Information Extraction (96.01% to 97.84%), and Document Classification (96.08% to 97.12%). Also achieves top results on Document Visual QA.

Conclusion: Bi-VLDoc's approach enhances cross-modal representation learning, advancing VrDU task performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal document pre-trained models have proven to be very effective in a variety of visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) tasks. Though existing document pre-trained models have achieved excellent performance on standard benchmarks for VrDU, the way they model and exploit the interactions between vision and language on documents has hindered them from better generalization ability and higher accuracy. In this work, we investigate the problem of vision-language joint representation learning for VrDU mainly from the perspective of supervisory signals. Specifically, a pre-training paradigm called Bi-VLDoc is proposed, in which a bidirectional vision-language supervision strategy and a vision-language hybrid-attention mechanism are devised to fully explore and utilize the interactions between these two modalities, to learn stronger cross-modal document representations with richer semantics. Benefiting from the learned informative cross-modal document representations, Bi-VLDoc significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used document understanding benchmarks, including Form Understanding (from 85.14% to 93.44%), Receipt Information Extraction (from 96.01% to 97.84%), and Document Classification (from 96.08% to 97.12%). On Document Visual QA, Bi-VLDoc achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single model methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for audio-driven lip sync fail to model personalized speaking styles accurately, leading to sub-optimal results. The paper aims to address this by leveraging relationships between input audio and reference audio.

Method: A Transformer-based model predicts lip motion from input audio, augmented by style information from reference videos via cross-attention. A conditional latent diffusion model renders realistic talking face videos by integrating lip motion and reference facial images.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves precise lip sync, preserves speaking styles, and generates high-fidelity talking face videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses style-preserving audio-driven lip sync, outperforming earlier techniques in accuracy and realism.

Abstract: Audio-driven lip sync has recently drawn significant attention due to its widespread application in the multimedia domain. Individuals exhibit distinct lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync. Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation. This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.

*Kiet Dang Vu, Trung Thai Tran, Duc Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD improves DETR-based monocular 3D detection with Mask Separated Self-Attention, Variational Query Denoising, and self-distillation, achieving top performance on KITTI and nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of DETR-like architectures in monocular 3D detection to achieve optimal performance.

Method: Introduces Mask Separated Self-Attention, Variational Query Denoising, and a self-distillation strategy.

Result: Superior performance on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, with broad applicability and generalization.

Conclusion: MonoVQD advances monocular 3D detection and demonstrates robust generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: SurgSora is a framework for generating high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos using a single input frame and motion cues, outperforming existing methods in realism and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical video generation methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism, limiting their utility in medical education and research.

Method: SurgSora uses self-predicted object features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow. It includes three modules: Dual Semantic Injector, Decoupled Flow Mapper, and Trajectory Controller, integrated with Stable Video Diffusion.

Result: SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability, validated by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations with expert surgeons.

Conclusion: SurgSora demonstrates high realism and potential for surgical training and education, advancing the field of surgical video synthesis.

Abstract: Surgical video generation can enhance medical education and research, but existing methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism. We introduce SurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues. Unlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on ground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for precise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual Semantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and segmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow Mapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for realistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates sparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning these enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical video synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further demonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the potential of our method for surgical training and education.

*Chengzhi Xu, Yuyang Wang, Lai Wei, Lichao Sun, Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartIR improves chart-to-code generation by using structured instructions and iterative refinement, outperforming other methods on models like Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs underperform in chart-to-code generation due to the complexity of translating visual elements into structured code.

Method: Proposes ChartIR, which uses structured instructions (description and difference) for visual understanding and decomposes the task into initial code generation and iterative refinement.

Result: Superior performance on Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o compared to other methods.

Conclusion: ChartIR effectively addresses the challenges of chart-to-code generation by leveraging structured instructions and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities. While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: EgoBlind highlights MLLMs' shortcomings and provides a foundation for improving AI assistants for blind individuals.

Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,392 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 5,311 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy near 60\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the overlooked role of image embeddings in ICL-based FSIC pipelines to enhance generalization in data-scarce domains.

Method: Systematically analyzes visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies for embedding models.

Result: Outperforms existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks while maintaining in-domain performance.

Conclusion: PictSure highlights the importance of embedding model design and pretraining for effective few-shot image classification.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings. In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size selection in CNNs, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size in CNNs is often overlooked but impacts performance; BKSEF addresses this gap.

Method: BKSEF integrates information theory, signal processing, and learning theory for layer-wise kernel size determination.

Result: Experiments show up to 3.1% accuracy gain and 42.8% FLOPs reduction; validated in medical and edge-device applications.

Conclusion: BKSEF redefines kernel size as an optimizable parameter, offering practical and theoretical benefits for CNN design.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method automates key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos, reducing manual effort and costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual video annotation in retail is time-consuming and costly, requiring automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational expenses.

Method: Uses deep neural networks for key-frame identification and object detection tailored for retail, automating most of the annotation process.

Result: Achieves human-level accuracy with 2x cost savings and requires human verification for less than 5% of frames.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces annotation costs and effort, benefiting retail applications like customer behavior analysis and security monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications, including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang, Feng Xu, Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel active view selection (AVS) method for 3D reconstruction uses a lightweight neural network (UPNet) to predict uncertainty maps from single images, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying minimal yet informative viewpoints for accurate 3D reconstruction, avoiding redundant computations and improving efficiency.

Method: Introduces UPNet, a feedforward deep neural network, to predict uncertainty maps for candidate viewpoints from a single image, then aggregates these maps to select the most informative views.

Result: Achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy with half the viewpoints, reduces computational overhead (400x speedup, 50% resource savings), and generalizes to novel object categories without retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed AVS method is efficient, scalable, and generalizable, offering significant computational savings without compromising reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment in T2I models is critical for capturing user intent while ensuring safety and fairness. Extending DPO from LLMs to T2I systems addresses these challenges.

Method: DPO-Kernels integrates hybrid loss, kernelized representations (RBF, Polynomial, Wavelet), and divergence selection (Wasserstein, R'enyi). The DETONATE benchmark evaluates social bias, and AQI measures alignment quality.

Result: DPO-Kernels improves alignment and robustness, demonstrated via HT-SR. DETONATE provides a large-scale benchmark for bias evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance T2I alignment, with DETONATE and AQI offering tools for evaluating and improving model fairness and safety.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for vision-language models struggle with multi-image positional reasoning, limiting their applicability to complex real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes PeRL, a general RL approach with permutation of image sequences and a rollout filtering mechanism to enhance exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Result: PeRL outperforms R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines on multi-image benchmarks while maintaining performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: PeRL effectively addresses the challenge of multi-image positional reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results and demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on medical image diffusion models, outperforming existing methods by focusing on mid-frequency reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in medical imaging by improving the accuracy of MIAs on diffusion models, which struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction and inherent image difficulty.

Method: Focuses on mid-frequency reconstruction errors, excluding high and low frequencies, analyzes the reverse diffusion process, and uses structural similarity index scores for membership determination.

Result: FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods on several medical image datasets.

Conclusion: The FCRE method effectively mitigates the impact of inherent image difficulty and improves MIA accuracy for medical image diffusion models.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quark-gluon jet discrimination is crucial for high-energy physics, but ViT's potential for direct calorimeter image analysis remains underexplored.

Method: The study uses simulated 2012 CMS Open Data to construct multi-channel jet-view images from energy deposits and tracks, evaluating ViT and hybrid models.

Result: ViT-based models, especially hybrids like ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt, outperform CNNs in classification metrics.

Conclusion: This work provides a systematic framework and performance baselines for ViT applications in jet classification, with a dataset for future research.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.

TL;DR: Proposes LRCN and Transformer models for accurate compliance prediction using RGB tactile images from GelSight, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection lacks portability and scalability, while existing neural methods suffer from low accuracy.

Method: Uses LRCN and Transformer architectures with GelSight sensor data to predict compliance metrics.

Result: Models show significant improvement over baselines; harder objects are more challenging to estimate.

Conclusion: The proposed models effectively improve compliance estimation, though harder objects remain a challenge.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering, agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps contain valuable georeferenced text, but extraction is hindered by lack of methods and training data, especially for varied map styles and complex text layouts.

Method: PALETTE introduces hyper-local sampling for precise feature learning and hyper-local positional embeddings for spatial interactions. SynthMap+ generates synthetic training data.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on historical map benchmarks, especially for long and angled text, and has processed 60,000+ maps with 100M+ labels.

Conclusion: PALETTE and SynthMap+ provide an effective solution for text extraction from historical maps, enabling large-scale processing and improved accuracy.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer is a unified framework for style transfer and text-driven stylization, using semantic-based style injection, data augmentation with human feedback, and a training-free triple diffusion process to achieve high-quality, artist-level results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in traditional style transfer methods and unify frameworks for different tasks, enabling artist-level style transfer and text-driven stylization.

Method: 1. Semantic-based style injection using BLIP and CLIP space. 2. Data augmentation with human feedback. 3. Training-free triple diffusion process for feature manipulation.

Result: High-quality image-driven style transfer, text-driven stylization, and image color editing while preserving original content.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer revolutionizes style transfer by combining semantic alignment, progressive learning, and diffusion-based feature manipulation for superior results.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions in vector quantization, addressing training instability and codebook collapse, achieving high codebook utilization and reduced quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods suffer from training instability and codebook collapse due to mismatched distributions of features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and data loss.

Method: The authors employ the Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors, improving codebook utilization and reducing quantization error.

Result: The approach achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduces quantization error, validated by empirical and theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: Using Wasserstein distance effectively addresses key issues in vector quantization, enhancing the performance of autoregressive models.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Deepank Singh, Vedhus Hoskere, Pietro Milillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based framework combines satellite imagery and building metadata for accurate, multiclass post-earthquake damage assessment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual damage assessments are slow and risky; current automated methods lack accuracy and practicality.

Method: Uses high-resolution satellite imagery and building-specific metadata (seismic intensity, soil properties, SAR maps) with a transformer model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass damage identification, with improved accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: The framework enables faster, precise building-level damage assessments, enhancing disaster response and recovery.

Abstract: Timely and accurate assessments of building damage are crucial for effective response and recovery in the aftermath of earthquakes. Conventional preliminary damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches. These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected communities.

TL;DR: SynPo improves few-shot medical image segmentation by enhancing negative prompts in LVMs like SAM, using a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module and K-means clustering for point selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods using LVMs underutilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images.

Method: SynPo combines DINOv2 and SAM to create a reliable confidence map, selects top-k positive and Gaussian-distributed negative points, and applies K-means clustering for high-quality prompts.

Result: SynPo matches state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods in performance.

Conclusion: SynPo effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by improving prompt quality, offering a competitive training-free solution.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Point Distribution Set Abstraction (PDSA) module to improve point cloud analysis by correcting feature distribution in high-dimensional space, enhancing efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aggregating local structures in point clouds suffer from irrelevant point interference, feature hierarchy gaps, high computational overhead, and noise sensitivity.

Method: PDSA uses high-dimensional correlations to refine feature distribution, employs a lightweight cross-stage descriptor for point correlation, and introduces a key point mechanism to reduce computational costs.

Result: Experiments on semantic segmentation and classification tasks show improved performance with fewer parameters, validated by ablation and visualization studies.

Conclusion: PDSA effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering better computational efficiency and robustness for point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data. While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

TL;DR: Echo-DND, a dual-noise diffusion model, improves LV segmentation in noisy echocardiograms by combining Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, multi-scale fusion, and spatial coherence calibration, outperforming SOTA models with Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LV segmentation in noisy, low-contrast echocardiograms is critical for diagnostics but challenging due to ambiguous boundaries.

Method: Echo-DND uses Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, a multi-scale fusion conditioning module, and spatial coherence calibration.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.962 (CAMUS) and 0.939 (EchoNet-Dynamic), outperforming SOTA models.

Conclusion: Echo-DND sets a new standard for echocardiogram segmentation and shows potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments. However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision. Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively. The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across various medical domains.

*Ziling Huang, Yidan Zhang, Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSeDis unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding for visual search, addressing both retrieval and localization challenges, and introduces a benchmark for rigorous evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques either focus on visual grounding (localization) or text-to-image retrieval (ranking), but not both. ReSeDis aims to solve this dual problem for robust multimodal search systems.

Method: Introduces the ReSeDis task, which requires models to retrieve relevant images and localize objects within them using bounding boxes or masks. A benchmark is curated for evaluation, and a zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model is provided.

Result: ReSeDis offers a unified framework for retrieval and localization, with a task-specific metric to evaluate performance. The zero-shot baseline shows significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: ReSeDis provides a realistic testbed for advancing multimodal search systems, combining retrieval and localization into a single task.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Result: Evaluated a state-of-the-art VICL approach on multiple OCT datasets, establishing a baseline for in-context learning in OCT.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential and limitations of VICL for OCT, with open-source code to encourage further research and adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast, generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), a method to protect images from exploitation by vision-language models while maintaining compression functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard user privacy by preventing misuse of publicly posted images by advanced vision-language models.

Method: Introduces PSIC, a flexible coding method with multiple decoding options, using a CLTG module and UAEO optimization function for adaptive multi-objective optimization.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in protecting images while preserving perceptual quality and compression functionality.

Conclusion: PSIC is a plug-and-play solution that integrates with existing Learned Image Compression models, offering robust privacy protection.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP) models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DM-FNet, a two-stage diffusion model-based network for high-quality multimodal medical image fusion, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods struggle with detailed feature capture and cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused images.

Method: DM-FNet uses a two-stage approach: Stage I trains UNet for image reconstruction via diffusion, and Stage II enhances feature recognition with noisy images and adaptive fusion modules.

Result: The method excels in objective metrics, producing fused images with balanced brightness, color, contrast, and detail.

Conclusion: DM-FNet significantly improves MMIF quality, offering detailed, high-information-density fused images for better diagnosis.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Result: Experiments on SSDD show improved accuracy for small targets, robustness to occlusions, and multi-scale adaptability.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN effectively enhances SAR ship detection by improving feature representation and fusion, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing. Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges, including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction and SLAM rely on accurate camera pose priors but struggle with complex trajectories, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: RA-NeRF integrates NeRF with photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation for robustness, and an implicit pose filter to refine camera movement patterns.

Result: RA-NeRF outperforms existing methods on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets, excelling in pose estimation and visual quality.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF is effective and robust for scene reconstruction under complex camera trajectories, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and quality.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

TL;DR: RetroMem is a recall-augmented COD architecture that dynamically integrates historical knowledge to improve camouflage object detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack mechanisms for historical context, limiting their effectiveness in complex camouflage scenes.

Method: RetroMem uses a two-stage training paradigm: a learning stage with a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) and a recall stage with dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and inference pattern reconstruction (IPR).

Result: Extensive experiments show RetroMem outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RetroMem enhances COD by leveraging historical knowledge and dynamic memory, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study advances DA techniques for semiconductors, demonstrating the efficacy of DBACS in practical settings.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of anatomical structures in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging; AR systems with 2D-3D registration need precise landmark detection.

Method: BCRNet uses Multi-modal Feature Extraction, Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization, and Hierarchical Curve Refinement for precise Bezier curve detection.

Result: BCRNet achieves significant improvements on L3D and P2ILF datasets.

Conclusion: BCRNet enhances surgical navigation by improving landmark detection, with code availability promised.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on 2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code will be available.

TL;DR: ViMAT is an AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks without rigid setups or markers, validated on LEGO and hydraulic press tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible and marker-free visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks for safety and error prevention.

Method: Combines a perception module (extracts visual data from multi-view video) and a reasoning module (infers actions based on observed state and task knowledge).

Result: Effective in challenging real-world scenarios with partial/uncertain observations, validated on LEGO and hydraulic press tasks.

Conclusion: ViMAT offers a practical, flexible solution for industrial assembly monitoring without workspace constraints.

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT, a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by partial and uncertain visual observations.

### [145] [OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15318)
*Lanfeng Zhong, Xin Liao, Shichuan Zhang, Shaoting Zhang, Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenPath introduces an open-set active learning method for pathology image classification, leveraging a vision-language model to efficiently select informative samples while avoiding OOD data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning methods assume closed-set scenarios and waste labeling costs in open-set environments with OOD data. OpenPath addresses this inefficiency.

Method: Uses task-specific prompts and Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) to select high-purity, informative samples, avoiding OOD data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods on two public pathology datasets.

Conclusion: OpenPath improves efficiency and performance in pathology image classification by effectively handling open-set scenarios.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Motivation: The task of counting unique object instances in videos, especially in crowded scenes with occlusions, is challenging and requires avoiding double counting and tracking reappearances.

Method: CountVid combines an image-based counting model with a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to count objects across frames.

Result: CountVid achieves accurate object counts and significantly outperforms baselines on the VideoCount dataset.

Conclusion: The model, dataset, and code are publicly available, facilitating further research in open-world object counting.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: A geometry-aware texture mapping method improves animal re-identification by unwarping deformable fur patterns into a canonical UV space, enhancing feature matching robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with geometric distortions in animal fur or skin patterns due to movement and posture changes.

Method: The approach uses surface normal estimation to unwarp pelage patterns into UV space, preserving geometric consistency between 3D surfaces and 2D textures. It focuses on Saimaa ringed seals and leopards.

Result: The method improves re-identification accuracy by up to 5.4% across diverse poses and viewing angles, without needing ground truth UV annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances re-identification accuracy for deformable animal patterns and can be trained self-supervised.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.

TL;DR: DDIS introduces a diffusion-assisted method for data-free image synthesis, leveraging a text-to-image diffusion model to improve synthetic image quality and alignment with the original training data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The utility of pre-trained models declines when their training data is unavailable, and existing DFIS methods produce samples that deviate from the true data distribution due to lack of prior knowledge.

Method: DDIS uses a text-to-image diffusion model as an image prior, introduces Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) for domain alignment, and optimizes a Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding for class-specific attributes.

Result: DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods on PACS and ImageNet, generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DDIS effectively addresses the limitations of existing DFIS methods by leveraging diffusion models and domain alignment, offering improved synthetic image quality for data-free applications.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications, but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in data-free applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NERO, a novel OOD scoring mechanism for medical imaging, leveraging neuron-level relevance to improve OOD detection and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability in deep learning for medical imaging is critical, especially for detecting OOD samples that could indicate anomalies. Existing methods may not fully capture OOD diversity.

Method: NERO clusters neuron-level relevance for ID classes to form centroids, uses a relevance distance metric for OOD detection, and refines performance with scaled relevance and feature norms.

Result: NERO outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks (Kvasir and GastroVision).

Conclusion: NERO enhances OOD detection in medical imaging, offering improved reliability and explainability.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale 4D HOI datasets limits progress in text-driven human motion synthesis, prompting the need for a solution that generalizes to unseen objects and produces high-quality 4D sequences.

Method: GenHOI uses an Object-AnchorNet for sparse 3D HOI keyframe reconstruction and a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) for dense 4D sequence interpolation, incorporating contact-aware components for improved quality.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen objects and high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: GenHOI effectively addresses the challenges of 4D HOI synthesis, offering a scalable solution with superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models. Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

TL;DR: CLAIM is a framework for generating realistic and diverse myocardial scar images from LGE cardiac MRI using clinical guidance, improving scar segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability and variability of high-quality labeled LGE images hinder robust scar segmentation model development.

Method: CLAIM uses a diffusion-based generator (SMILE module) guided by the AHA 17-segment model for anatomically consistent scar synthesis, coupled with joint training of the segmentation network.

Result: CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scars and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions than baselines.

Conclusion: CLAIM enables realistic and controllable scar synthesis, enhancing downstream medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this, we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE \textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet eliminates dense LiDAR supervision for radar-based depth estimation, using sparse LiDAR to achieve comparable or better results with only 1% supervision density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dense metric depth estimation using radar require costly dense LiDAR supervision. RaCalNet aims to reduce this dependency while maintaining accuracy.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates sparse radar points to create depth priors, which guide monocular depth prediction without dense supervision.

Result: RaCalNet outperforms dense-supervised methods, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89% on datasets, with clearer object contours and textures.

Conclusion: RaCalNet demonstrates that sparse supervision can achieve superior depth estimation, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to dense-supervised methods.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

TL;DR: WinWinLay is a training-free method for Layout-to-Image generation, improving control precision and realism using Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using pre-trained diffusion models struggle with imprecise localization and artifacts. WinWinLay addresses these issues without additional training.

Method: Proposes Non-local Attention Energy Function to redistribute attention scores and Adaptive Update (Langevin dynamics-based) to maintain pre-trained domain fidelity.

Result: WinWinLay outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precise element placement and photorealistic quality.

Conclusion: WinWinLay effectively enhances Layout-to-Image generation by improving control and realism without requiring training.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To improve multimodal understanding and generation by unifying visual and language representations.

Method: Uses a 3D causal variational autoencoder with dual-path spatial-temporal fusion, autoregressive modeling for text, and flow matching for image/video generation.

Result: Show-o2 effectively handles diverse multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates scalability and versatility in multimodal applications.

Abstract: This paper presents improved native unified multimodal models, \emph{i.e.,} Show-o2, that leverage autoregressive modeling and flow matching. Built upon a 3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model, autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and image/video generation.

*Junhao Wu, Aboagye-Ntow Stephen, Chuyuan Wang, Gang Chen, Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient semi-supervised framework for ultra-high-resolution (0.3 m) land cover classification, leveraging SAM2 and a FreqWeaver Adapter, outperforms existing methods with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in ultra-high-resolution land cover classification include high annotation costs, scale variation, and limited adaptability of large-scale models. Existing methods focus on lower resolutions and rely on annotated data, whereas practical applications need higher resolutions under weak supervision.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m imagery, integrating SAM2 knowledge and a FreqWeaver Adapter for fine-grained detail modeling with only 5.96% of total model parameters.

Result: Achieves robust segmentation with superior structural consistency, improving by 1.78% over parameter-efficient tuning strategies and 3.44% over state-of-the-art high-resolution methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses ultra-high-resolution land cover classification challenges, leveraging unlabeled data and minimal parameter overhead for superior performance.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on 1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery, which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

*Di Wang, Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel graph-based framework for end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction improves large-scale AGB estimation, reducing reliance on high-quality TLS data and pre-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QSM methods for AGB estimation are limited by dependency on high-quality TLS data and complex pre-processing, hindering scalability.

Method: Proposes a unified graph-based pipeline integrating tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction using dedicated graph operations.

Result: Achieves strong performance in leaf-on (~20% error) and low-density ULS (~30% error) scenarios, validating robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, supporting broader applications in forest management and climate research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### [160] [One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15591)
*Yujing Sun, Lingchen Sun, Shuaizheng Liu, Rongyuan Wu, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm for video super-resolution, combining temporal consistency and spatial detail enhancement using stable diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using stable diffusion for Real-VSR often sacrifice spatial details for temporal coherence, leading to suboptimal results. The goal is to balance both aspects effectively.

Method: DLoRAL introduces Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) and Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) for temporal consistency, followed by Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) for spatial detail enhancement, iteratively optimizing both.

Result: DLoRAL achieves high-quality video restoration with both temporal consistency and rich spatial details in a single diffusion step, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: The proposed DLoRAL framework successfully integrates temporal coherence and detail enhancement, offering a practical solution for Real-VSR.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

*Kyobin Choo, Hyunkyung Han, Jinyeong Kim, Chanyong Yoon, Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2M-Reg is a novel framework for multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) that uses mono-modal similarity, outperforming prior methods in PET-MRI and FA-MRI alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DIR methods struggle with highly heterogeneous modalities due to unreliable similarity metrics.

Method: Proposes M2M-Reg, leveraging mono-modal similarity and GradCyCon for regularization, and extends to semi-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods on ADNI dataset for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg effectively handles heterogeneous multi-modal DIR, offering seamless integration and improved performance.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reconstruction-free online framework for open-vocabulary 3D object detection, leveraging pre-trained models and multi-view fusion for real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory constraints of dense point cloud reconstruction in existing 3D detection methods.

Method: Uses Cubify Anything for single-view detection and CLIP for semantics, with multi-view fusion via association and optimization modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets, enabling real-time detection in large environments.

Conclusion: The framework offers efficient, real-time 3D detection with strong generalization, suitable for autonomous driving and embodied AI.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

*Roey Ron, Guy Tevet, Haim Sawdayee, Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi is a text-driven diffusion framework for realistic human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis, optimizing in noise space to balance realism and physical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI generation is challenging due to strict contact accuracy and diverse motion requirements. Current methods compromise between realism and correctness.

Method: HOIDiNi uses Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) in a pretrained diffusion model, splitting the problem into object-centric (contact choices) and human-centric (motion refinement) phases.

Result: Outperforms prior works in contact accuracy, physical validity, and quality on the GRAB dataset, enabling complex interactions like grasping and placing via text prompts.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi achieves realistic and physically correct HOI generation, demonstrating controllable interactions driven by text.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

*Karmesh Yadav, Yusuf Ali, Gunshi Gupta, Yarin Gal, Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating long-range embodied tasks in robotics, focusing on memory integration and reasoning in the Habitat simulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack scenarios requiring long-term memory and embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which are crucial for real-world robotics applications.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark with 60 tasks in the Habitat simulator, designed to test memory-based capabilities and scalable reasoning. They also integrate state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) with navigation policies for evaluation.

Result: Baseline results highlight the limitations of current VLMs in handling memory-intensive tasks, identifying areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a scalable framework for assessing memory and reasoning in embodied agents, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs perform better with degraded images, contrary to human perception. VQ-TTT, a lightweight adaptation module, improves accuracy by dynamically adjusting image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual quality affects MLLM performance and address the paradox where degraded images improve results.

Method: Systematic study with controlled image degradations and stylistic shifts, followed by introducing VQ-TTT for dynamic image adjustment.

Result: VQ-TTT improves MLLM accuracy across datasets without external models or extra data.

Conclusion: Adaptive image quality, not universally 'clean' images, is key for MLLMs, redefining visual input standards.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR is a two-stage inference framework for VLMs that improves efficiency and output fidelity by combining a value model with margin-aware rewards, achieving faster and more reliable captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time search methods for VLMs are computationally expensive and prone to low-confidence generations, leading to persistent hallucinations.

Method: ViMaR uses a temporal-difference value model and margin-aware reward adjustment to first identify high-value captions and then selectively refine weak segments.

Result: ViMaR generates more reliable, accurate, and detailed captions with a 4× speedup, and generalizes well to unseen models.

Conclusion: ViMaR is a scalable, transferable, and self-improving inference-time decoding strategy for VLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

TL;DR: A novel joint approach for image/video relighting using video diffusion models, improving generalization and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing relighting methods, which struggle with data scarcity, error accumulation, and realism.

Method: Joint estimation of albedo and relit outputs in a single pass using video diffusion models, trained on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: Strong generalization, superior visual fidelity, and temporal consistency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances relighting by combining implicit scene understanding and generative capabilities for realistic results.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Sekai addresses key limitations of existing datasets and supports video generation and world exploration. It enables training models like YUME and opens avenues for future applications.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are slow and computationally expensive; existing caching methods are rigid and lack generalization.

Method: ECAD employs a genetic algorithm to learn efficient, per-model caching schedules using calibration prompts.

Result: ECAD achieves significant speedups (e.g., 2.58x on PixArt-alpha) and better quality metrics (e.g., 4.47 FID improvement).

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable, generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion models, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of pre-training on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), revealing its role in target error and proposing a novel framework, TriDA, to address these issues by incorporating pre-training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the impact of pre-training on UDA, as it is often overlooked despite its significance in domain adaptation tasks.

Method: The study analyzes distribution discrepancies between pre-training, source, and target domains, then introduces TriDA, a framework that integrates pre-training data into UDA to maintain pre-trained knowledge and improve error bounds.

Result: TriDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in UDA tasks, even with limited pre-training data or synthesized images, and complements existing UDA methods.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of pre-training in UDA and offers a practical solution (TriDA) to enhance adaptation performance, providing new insights for domain adaptation research.

Abstract: In deep learning, initializing models with pre-trained weights has become the de facto practice for various downstream tasks. Many unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods typically adopt a backbone pre-trained on ImageNet, and focus on reducing the source-target domain discrepancy. However, the impact of pre-training on adaptation received little attention. In this study, we delve into UDA from the novel perspective of pre-training. We first demonstrate the impact of pre-training by analyzing the dynamic distribution discrepancies between pre-training data domain and the source/ target domain during adaptation. Then, we reveal that the target error also stems from the pre-training in the following two factors: 1) empirically, target error arises from the gradually degenerative pre-trained knowledge during adaptation; 2) theoretically, the error bound depends on difference between the gradient of loss function, \ie, on the target domain and pre-training data domain. To address these two issues, we redefine UDA as a three-domain problem, \ie, source domain, target domain, and pre-training data domain; then we propose a novel framework, named TriDA. We maintain the pre-trained knowledge and improve the error bound by incorporating pre-training data into adaptation for both vanilla UDA and source-free UDA scenarios. For efficiency, we introduce a selection strategy for pre-training data, and offer a solution with synthesized images when pre-training data is unavailable during adaptation. Notably, TriDA is effective even with a small amount of pre-training or synthesized images, and seamlessly complements the two scenario UDA methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We hope our work provides new insights for better understanding and application of domain adaptation.

TL;DR: PanopticNeRF-360 combines 3D and 2D priors to generate high-quality panoptic labels and images from any viewpoint, improving generalization for perception models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack labels for rare viewpoints, limiting model generalization. PanopticNeRF-360 addresses this by leveraging 3D and 2D priors.

Method: The approach uses coarse 3D annotations and noisy 2D cues to guide geometry optimization, filtering noise via a semantic field, and hybrid scene features for appearance.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360, enabling high-fidelity, consistent omnidirectional rendering of labels and appearance.

Conclusion: PanopticNeRF-360 effectively enhances perception models by generating high-quality labels and images from any viewpoint.

Abstract: Training perception systems for self-driving cars requires substantial 2D annotations that are labor-intensive to manual label. While existing datasets provide rich annotations on pre-recorded sequences, they fall short in labeling rarely encountered viewpoints, potentially hampering the generalization ability for perception models. In this paper, we present PanopticNeRF-360, a novel approach that combines coarse 3D annotations with noisy 2D semantic cues to generate high-quality panoptic labels and images from any viewpoint. Our key insight lies in exploiting the complementarity of 3D and 2D priors to mutually enhance geometry and semantics. Specifically, we propose to leverage coarse 3D bounding primitives and noisy 2D semantic and instance predictions to guide geometry optimization, by encouraging predicted labels to match panoptic pseudo ground truth. Simultaneously, the improved geometry assists in filtering 3D&2D annotation noise by fusing semantics in 3D space via a learned semantic field. To further enhance appearance, we combine MLP and hash grids to yield hybrid scene features, striking a balance between high-frequency appearance and contiguous semantics. Our experiments demonstrate PanopticNeRF-360's state-of-the-art performance over label transfer methods on the challenging urban scenes of the KITTI-360 dataset. Moreover, PanopticNeRF-360 enables omnidirectional rendering of high-fidelity, multi-view and spatiotemporally consistent appearance, semantic and instance labels. We make our code and data available at https://github.com/fuxiao0719/PanopticNeRF

*Jingyuan Yang, Jiawei Feng, Weibin Luo, Dani Lischinski, Daniel Cohen-Or, Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoEdit enhances Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) by incorporating content modifications for precise emotional shifts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIM methods focus on color and style adjustments, often failing to evoke precise emotions. EmoEdit addresses this by integrating psychological insights and content modifications.

Method: EmoEdit constructs a large dataset (EmoEditSet), introduces an Emotion adapter for generative models, and uses an instruction loss for semantic variations.

Result: EmoEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations and adapts to other diffusion models.

Conclusion: EmoEdit advances AIM by combining content modifications with emotion-aware adapters, offering superior emotional impact and versatility.

Abstract: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) seeks to modify user-provided images to evoke specific emotional responses. This task is inherently complex due to its twofold objective: significantly evoking the intended emotion, while preserving the original image composition. Existing AIM methods primarily adjust color and style, often failing to elicit precise and profound emotional shifts. Drawing on psychological insights, we introduce EmoEdit, which extends AIM by incorporating content modifications to enhance emotional impact. Specifically, we first construct EmoEditSet, a large-scale AIM dataset comprising 40,120 paired data through emotion attribution and data construction. To make existing generative models emotion-aware, we design the Emotion adapter and train it using EmoEditSet. We further propose an instruction loss to capture the semantic variations in data pairs. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we showcase the portability of our Emotion adapter to other diffusion-based models, enhancing their emotion knowledge with diverse semantics.

*Vaibhav Vavilala, Florian Kluger, Seemandhar Jain, Bodo Rosenhahn, Anand Bhattad, David Forsyth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for scene description using geometric primitives, including negative primitives, and evaluates its performance on depth representation and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in accurately describing scenes with varying numbers of interacting primitives, while existing methods lack the ability to incorporate negative primitives and dynamically choose their numbers.

Method: The method uses a learned regression to predict initial primitives, refines them with a descent method, and employs ensembling to determine the number of positive and negative primitives.

Result: The approach improves depth representation and segmentation on the NYUv2 dataset and shows robustness on LAION images, with negative primitives significantly boosting accuracy.

Conclusion: The method advances scene description by effectively incorporating negative primitives and dynamically selecting their numbers, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Describing a scene in terms of primitives -- geometrically simple shapes that offer a parsimonious but accurate abstraction of structure -- is an established and difficult fitting problem. Different scenes require different numbers of primitives, and these primitives interact strongly. Existing methods are evaluated by predicting depth, normals and segmentation from the primitives, then evaluating the accuracy of those predictions. The state of the art method involves a learned regression procedure to predict a start point consisting of a fixed number of primitives, followed by a descent method to refine the geometry and remove redundant primitives.
  CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) representations are significantly enhanced by a set-differencing operation. Our representation incorporates negative primitives, which are differenced from the positive primitives. These notably enrich the geometry that the model can encode, while complicating the fitting problem. This paper demonstrates a method that can (a) incorporate these negative primitives and (b) choose the overall number of positive and negative primitives by ensembling. Extensive experiments on the standard NYUv2 dataset confirm that (a) this approach results in substantial improvements in depth representation and segmentation over SOTA and (b) negative primitives make a notable contribution to accuracy. Our method is robustly applicable across datasets: in a first, we evaluate primitive prediction for LAION images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and clarify the evolving fields of OOD detection, anomaly detection, novelty detection, open set recognition, and outlier detection in the context of VLMs and LVLMs.

Method: Proposes a generalized OOD detection v2 framework, reviews methodologies, and benchmarks, and explores advancements in the LVLM era.

Result: Identifies OOD detection and anomaly detection as key challenges, with updated definitions and problem settings due to VLMs.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges and future directions, providing a resource for further research in the field.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for ensuring the safety of machine learning systems and has shaped the field of OOD detection. Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of these fields in the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. Then, we highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD detection and related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection. Finally, we explore the advancements in the emerging Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) era, such as GPT-4V. We conclude with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BFSSL, a motion blur-resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning method, and DRL-BFSSL, a resource allocation scheme, to enhance privacy and efficiency in IoV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy leakage in MoCo-based FSSL and mitigate motion blur's impact on model aggregation in IoV.

Method: Introduces SimCo for privacy protection, BFSSL for motion blur resistance, and DRL-BFSSL for optimized resource allocation.

Result: Simulations confirm the effectiveness of BFSSL and DRL-BFSSL in improving privacy and reducing energy/latency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance FSSL in IoV by addressing privacy, motion blur, and resource efficiency.

Abstract: In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving solution by aggregating local models without sharing data. Traditional supervised learning requires image data with labels, but data labeling involves significant manual effort. Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) utilizes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for local training in FL, eliminating the need for labels while protecting privacy. Compared to other SSL methods, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) reduces the demand for computing resources and storage space by creating a dictionary. However, using MoCo in FSSL requires uploading the local dictionary from vehicles to Base Station (BS), which poses a risk of privacy leakage. Simplified Contrast (SimCo) addresses the privacy leakage issue in MoCo-based FSSL by using dual temperature instead of a dictionary to control sample distribution. Additionally, considering the negative impact of motion blur on model aggregation, and based on SimCo, we propose a motion blur-resistant FSSL method, referred to as BFSSL. Furthermore, we address energy consumption and delay in the BFSSL process by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme, called DRL-BFSSL. In this scheme, BS allocates the Central Processing Unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of vehicles to minimize energy consumption and latency, while aggregating received models based on the motion blur level. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed aggregation and resource allocation methods.

*Seth Z. Zhao, Hao Xiang, Chenfeng Xu, Xin Xia, Bolei Zhou, Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning framework for V2X cooperative perception eliminates the need for costly 3D annotations by leveraging unlabeled data and a novel proxy task for LiDAR point cloud reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X methods require expensive and time-consuming 3D annotations, prompting the need for a self-supervised approach to utilize unlabeled data efficiently.

Method: The framework aggregates multi-agent sensing data, formulates a proxy task for LiDAR point cloud reconstruction, and employs a BEV-guided masking strategy to focus on 3D features across agents.

Result: The method improves performance by 4% mAP on V2X-Real and achieves baseline results with only 50% training data, demonstrating data efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: CooPre offers a scalable, annotation-free solution for V2X cooperative perception, with strong cross-domain transferability and compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Existing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception methods rely on accurate multi-agent 3D annotations. Nevertheless, it is time-consuming and expensive to collect and annotate real-world data, especially for V2X systems. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning framwork for V2X cooperative perception, which utilizes the vast amount of unlabeled 3D V2X data to enhance the perception performance. Specifically, multi-agent sensing information is aggregated to form a holistic view and a novel proxy task is formulated to reconstruct the LiDAR point clouds across multiple connected agents to better reason multi-agent spatial correlations. Besides, we develop a V2X bird-eye-view (BEV) guided masking strategy which effectively allows the model to pay attention to 3D features across heterogeneous V2X agents (i.e., vehicles and infrastructure) in the BEV space. Noticeably, such a masking strategy effectively pretrains the 3D encoder with a multi-agent LiDAR point cloud reconstruction objective and is compatible with mainstream cooperative perception backbones. Our approach, validated through extensive experiments on representative datasets (i.e., V2X-Real, V2V4Real, and OPV2V) and multiple state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods (i.e., AttFuse, F-Cooper, and V2X-ViT), leads to a performance boost across all V2X settings. Notably, CooPre achieves a 4% mAP improvement on V2X-Real dataset and surpasses baseline performance using only 50% of the training data, highlighting its data efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's powerful performance in cross-domain transferability and robustness under challenging scenarios. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ucla-mobility/CooPre.

*Sihyun Yu, Sangkyung Kwak, Huiwon Jang, Jongheon Jeong, Jonathan Huang, Jinwoo Shin, Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces REPA, a regularization method aligning noisy input representations with clean external visual encoders, improving training efficiency and generation quality in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quality of representations in diffusion models lags behind self-supervised methods, and training efficiency is a bottleneck. External visual representations can aid learning.

Method: REPA aligns noisy input hidden states with clean image representations from pretrained encoders.

Result: REPA speeds up training (17.5× for SiT) and achieves state-of-the-art FID=1.42 with classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: REPA is a simple yet effective method to enhance diffusion model training and generation quality.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel jailbreak attack framework, Multi-Modal Linkage (MML), is proposed to exploit vulnerabilities in advanced VLMs like GPT-4o by using cross-modal encryption-decryption and 'evil alignment' techniques, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing jailbreak methods against state-of-the-art VLMs, which struggle due to over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealth.

Method: MML employs an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities and uses 'evil alignment' to covertly align outputs with malicious intent, framed as a video game scenario.

Result: MML achieves attack success rates of 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench, and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset against GPT-4o.

Conclusion: MML is an effective jailbreak attack framework for advanced VLMs, demonstrating high success rates and stealth.

Abstract: With the significant advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), concerns about their potential misuse and abuse have grown rapidly. Previous studies have highlighted VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, existing methods struggle against state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o, due to the over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML utilizes an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate over-exposure of malicious information. To align the model's output with malicious intent covertly, MML employs a technique called "evil alignment", framing the attack within a video game production scenario. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MML's effectiveness. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset.

TL;DR: Click-Calib is a pattern-free, user-friendly method for offline SVS extrinsic calibration, achieving high accuracy across short and long distances by optimizing keypoint reprojection errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional offline SVS calibration methods are cumbersome, rely on physical patterns, and perform poorly in distant zones. Click-Calib addresses these issues by eliminating the need for special setups.

Method: Users click keypoints on the ground in natural scenes. The method optimizes camera poses by minimizing reprojection errors, supporting single-frame and multiple-frame modes.

Result: Click-Calib outperforms baseline methods in accuracy and robustness, as validated on in-house and public datasets.

Conclusion: Click-Calib offers a practical, accurate, and robust solution for SVS extrinsic calibration, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Surround-View System (SVS) is an essential component in Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and requires precise calibrations. However, conventional offline extrinsic calibration methods are cumbersome and time-consuming as they rely heavily on physical patterns. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on short-range areas surrounding the vehicle, resulting in lower calibration quality in more distant zones. To address these limitations, we propose Click-Calib, a pattern-free approach for offline SVS extrinsic calibration. Without requiring any special setup, the user only needs to click a few keypoints on the ground in natural scenes. Unlike other offline calibration approaches, Click-Calib optimizes camera poses over a wide range by minimizing reprojection distance errors of keypoints, thereby achieving accurate calibrations at both short and long distances. Furthermore, Click-Calib supports both single-frame and multiple-frame modes, with the latter offering even better results. Evaluations on our in-house dataset and the public WoodScape dataset demonstrate its superior accuracy and robustness compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: Gait analysis is crucial in biometrics, biomechanics, and rehabilitation, but underfoot pressure data is limited due to scarce datasets. The paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: The dataset includes high-resolution plantar pressure data from 150 individuals, collected using a pressure-sensing walkway, with varied walking speeds and footwear conditions.

Result: The dataset contains over 200,000 footsteps, enabling advancements in gait recognition and biomechanics research.

Conclusion: UNB StepUP-P150 sets a new benchmark for plantar pressure-based gait analysis, opening doors for further research in deep learning and biomechanics.

Abstract: Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioral traits. Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports, and rehabilitation. While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture, advances in plantar pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights into gait. However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due to the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets. To address this, we introduce the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset: a footStep database for gait analysis and recognition using Underfoot Pressure, including data from 150 individuals. This dataset comprises high-resolution plantar pressure data (4 sensors per cm-squared) collected using a 1.2m by 3.6m pressure-sensing walkway. It contains over 200,000 footsteps from participants walking with various speeds (preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and slow) and footwear conditions (barefoot, standard shoes, and two personal shoes), supporting advancements in biometric gait recognition and presenting new research opportunities in biomechanics and deep learning. UNB StepUP-P150 establishes a new benchmark for plantar pressure-based gait analysis and recognition.

TL;DR: F-16 is a multimodal LLM for high-frame-rate video understanding, outperforming SOTA models by capturing dynamic features at 16 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use low frame rates (≤2 FPS), losing critical visual information. F-16 addresses this gap.

Method: Increases frame rate to 16 FPS, compresses visual tokens per clip, and introduces efficient decoding for low-frame-rate inference.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks like Video-MME and TemporalBench, excelling in spatiotemporal tasks.

Conclusion: F-16 enhances video understanding without scaling model size or data, offering a novel approach for video LLMs.

Abstract: Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining.

Motivation: Existing DLA methods require large-scale source data and target labels, limiting real-world applicability in sensitive domains.

Method: Proposes DLAdapter, a framework for source-free adaptation, and establishes the first SFDLA benchmark.

Result: DLAdapter improves performance by +4.21% over the source-only baseline and +2.26% over existing methods.

Conclusion: The work advances source-free document understanding and provides resources for future research.

Abstract: Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is a fundamental task in document understanding. However, existing DLA and adaptation methods often require access to large-scale source data and target labels. This requirements severely limiting their real-world applicability, particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained domains, such as financial statements, medical records, and proprietary business documents. According to our observation, directly transferring source-domain fine-tuned models on target domains often results in a significant performance drop (Avg. -32.64%). In this work, we introduce Source-Free Document Layout Analysis (SFDLA), aiming for adapting a pre-trained source DLA models to an unlabeled target domain, without access to any source data. To address this challenge, we establish the first SFDLA benchmark, covering three major DLA datasets for geometric- and content-aware adaptation. Furthermore, we propose Document Layout Analysis Adapter (DLAdapter), a novel framework that is designed to improve source-free adaptation across document domains. Our method achieves a +4.21% improvement over the source-only baseline and a +2.26% gain over existing source-free methods from PubLayNet to DocLayNet. We believe this work will inspire the DLA community to further investigate source-free document understanding.

Motivation: Existing chart understanding methods lack explicit visual element identification, limiting detailed understanding and human-computer interaction.

Method: Introduces RefChartQA, a benchmark integrating ChartQA and visual grounding, and evaluates 5 state-of-the-art VLMs with spatial awareness.

Result: Incorporating grounding improves accuracy by over 15%, reduces hallucinations, and enhances model reliability. TinyChart's token-merging module improves text-spatial alignment.

Conclusion: RefChartQA advances chart understanding by enabling multi-granularity visual grounding, with open-sourced data and models for community use.

Abstract: Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have increasingly emphasized document visual grounding to achieve better human-computer interaction, accessibility, and detailed understanding. However, its application to visualizations such as charts remains under-explored due to the inherent complexity of interleaved visual-numerical relationships in chart images. Existing chart understanding methods primarily focus on answering questions without explicitly identifying the visual elements that support their predictions. To bridge this gap, we introduce RefChartQA, a novel benchmark that integrates Chart Question Answering (ChartQA) with visual grounding, enabling models to refer elements at multiple granularities within chart images. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation by instruction-tuning 5 state-of-the-art VLMs across different categories. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating spatial awareness via grounding improves response accuracy by over 15%, reducing hallucinations, and improving model reliability. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing text-spatial alignment, such as architectural improvements in TinyChart, which leverages a token-merging module for enhanced feature fusion. Our dataset is open-sourced for community development and further advancements. All models and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/moured/RefChartQA.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to physical attacks (e.g., printed photos) and digital threats (e.g., DeepFake), which are currently being studied as independent visual tasks, such as Face Anti-Spoofing and Forgery Detection. The inherent differences among various attack types present significant challenges in identifying a common feature space, making it difficult to develop a unified framework for detecting data from both attack modalities simultaneously. Inspired by the efficacy of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in learning across diverse domains, we explore utilizing multiple experts to learn the distinct features of various attack types. However, the feature distributions of physical and digital attacks overlap and differ. This suggests that relying solely on distinct experts to learn the unique features of each attack type may overlook shared knowledge between them. To address these issues, we propose SUEDE, the Shared Unified Experts for Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection Enhancement. SUEDE combines a shared expert (always activated) to capture common features for both attack types and multiple routed experts (selectively activated) for specific attack types. Further, we integrate CLIP as the base network to ensure the shared expert benefits from prior visual knowledge and align visual-text representations in a unified space. Extensive results demonstrate SUEDE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unified detection methods.

*Justus Westerhoff, Erblina Purelku, Jakob Hackstein, Jonas Loos, Leo Pinetzki, Lorenz Hufe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCAM, a large and diverse dataset for studying typographic attacks on multimodal models, showing their impact on performance and model vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for typographic attacks are limited, hindering research on vulnerabilities in multimodal models.

Method: The authors created SCAM, a dataset of 1,162 real-world typographic attack images, and benchmarked Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to analyze performance degradation and susceptibility factors.

Result: Typographic attacks degrade VLM performance, with susceptibility influenced by training data and model architecture. Larger LLM backbones reduce vulnerability.

Conclusion: The work provides a resource for robust multimodal AI research, showing synthetic attacks resemble real-world ones, and releases datasets and code publicly.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations at www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance anomaly detection and localization in SAR imagery by introducing a bounded metric (ACE) for better performance.

Method: Uses adaptive cosine estimator (ACE) for anomaly detection, replacing PaDiM's Mahalanobis distance. Evaluated on SAR datasets with AUROC metrics.

Result: Improved anomaly detection and localization performance in SAR imagery.

Conclusion: ACE provides bounded anomaly scores, outperforming PaDiM in SAR anomaly detection and localization.

Abstract: This work presents a new approach to anomaly detection and localization in synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR), expanding upon the existing patch distribution modeling framework (PaDiM). We introduce the adaptive cosine estimator (ACE) detection statistic. PaDiM uses the Mahalanobis distance at inference, an unbounded metric. ACE instead uses the cosine similarity metric, providing bounded anomaly detection scores. The proposed method is evaluated across multiple SAR datasets, with performance metrics including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) at the image and pixel level, aiming for increased performance in anomaly detection and localization of SAR imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data augmentation by integrating style transfer and random erasing for better training performance.

Method: Apply random style transfer to images, then replace random subregions with style-transferred patches.

Conclusion: The technique is versatile, effective, and easily integrated into existing pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that combines the advantages of style augmentation and random erasing by selectively replacing image subregions with style-transferred patches. Our approach first applies a random style transfer to training images, then randomly substitutes selected areas of these images with patches derived from the style-transferred versions. This method is able to seamlessly accommodate a wide range of existing style transfer algorithms and can be readily integrated into diverse data augmentation pipelines. By incorporating our strategy, the training process becomes more robust and less prone to overfitting. Comparative experiments demonstrate that, relative to previous style augmentation methods, our technique achieves superior performance and faster convergence.

*Xiao Zhang, Lu Zou, Tao Lu, Yuan Yao, Zhangjin Huang, Guoping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INKL-Pose is a novel framework for category-level object pose estimation, using instance-adaptive keypoint learning and local-to-global geometric aggregation to handle complex geometries and shape deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with intra-class variations, especially for objects with complex geometries or non-canonical shapes.

Method: INKL-Pose predicts keypoints with an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detector, refines them using local and global feature aggregators (including bidirectional Mamba), and employs surface and separation losses for keypoint optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D datasets with 16.7M parameters and 36 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPU.

Conclusion: INKL-Pose effectively addresses challenges in category-level pose estimation, offering strong generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and size of previously unseen instances from predefined categories, requiring strong generalization across diverse object instances. Although many previous methods attempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances exhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes. To address this issue, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object pose estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with local-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our method first predicts semantically consistent and geometrically informative keypoints using an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detector, then refines them: (1) a Local Keypoint Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global Keypoint Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural consistency. To enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a simple yet effective Feature Sequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while constructing backward feature sequence. Additionally, we design a surface loss and a separation loss to encourage uniform coverage and spatial diversity in keypoint distribution. The resulting keypoints are mapped to a canonical space for 6D pose and size regression. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D show that INKL-Pose achieves state-of-the-art performance with 16.7M parameters and runs at 36 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPU.

TL;DR: VideoHallu is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities in synthetic videos, showing current models struggle with commonsense and physics reasoning. Post-training with GRPO improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic video generation often violates commonsense and physical laws, necessitating robust abnormality detectors for MLLMs.

Method: VideoHallu includes 3,000+ video QA pairs from synthetic videos (e.g., Veo2, Sora) with counterintuitive QA to test MLLMs. Benchmark evaluates alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics.

Result: SOTA MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro) perform well on real-world benchmarks but struggle with synthetic video abnormalities. GRPO post-training improves detection.

Conclusion: Targeted training (e.g., GRPO) enhances MLLMs' understanding of commonsense and physics in synthetic videos, addressing hallucination issues.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation has gained significant attention for its realism and broad applications, but remains prone to violations of common sense and physical laws. This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.

TL;DR: RDD, a deformable transformer-based keypoint detector/descriptor, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by capturing global context and geometric invariance, validated on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unresolved challenges in feature detection/description under significant viewpoint changes, focusing on long-range visual cues.

Method: Leverages deformable transformer with self-attention to reduce search space complexity and model geometric invariance, trained on Air-to-Ground and MegaDepth datasets.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in sparse matching and enables semi-dense matching, validated on new challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: RDD demonstrates superior performance by integrating global context and geometric invariance, with potential for broader applications in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

Conclusion: MSVIT is a significant advancement in SNN-transformer architectures, offering improved performance and feature extraction.

Abstract: The combination of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Vision Transformer architectures has garnered significant attention due to their potential for energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, a substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based transformer architectures. While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively extracting features from different image scales. In this paper, we address this issue and propose MSVIT. This novel spike-driven Transformer architecture firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enhance the capabilities of spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main datasets. The experimental results show that MSVIT outperforms existing SNN-based models, positioning itself as a state-of-the-art solution among SNN-transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive VLMs like LLaVA lack fast inference and controllable generation, while DMs show promise but are underexplored for multimodal tasks.

Method: LaViDa integrates DMs with a vision encoder, using techniques like complementary masking, prefix KV cache, and timestep shifting for training and inference.

Result: LaViDa outperforms AR VLMs on benchmarks (e.g., +4.1 CIDEr on COCO captioning, 1.92x speedup) and excels in bidirectional tasks (+59% on Constrained Poem Completion).

Conclusion: LaViDa proves to be a strong alternative to AR VLMs, combining the advantages of DMs with multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

TL;DR: The paper proposes T²A, a test-time adaptation method for deepfake detectors to handle postprocessing and distribution shifts, using uncertainty-aware negative learning and prioritization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors degrade in performance due to postprocessing and distribution shifts in real-world scenarios.

Method: T²A uses uncertainty-aware negative learning, uncertain sample prioritization, and gradients masking for adaptation during inference without source data or labels.

Result: The method outperforms existing TTA approaches, improving detector resilience and generalization.

Conclusion: T²A enhances deepfake detector adaptability and performance in real-world settings.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers in CNNs to discrete shifts and continuous translations, with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention on normalization layers in designing translation-equivariant CNNs, which is crucial for scientific computing and imaging accuracy.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework to analyze equivariance in normalization layers and tests it empirically using ResNet-18 and ImageNet feature maps.

Result: Theoretical predictions about equivariance conditions for normalization layers are validated by empirical results.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for designing equivariant normalization layers, enhancing CNN performance in scientific applications.

Abstract: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are consistent with our predictions.

*Nick Jiang, Amil Dravid, Alexei Efros, Yossi Gandelsman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method to mitigate high-norm token artifacts in Vision Transformers by shifting activations to an untrained token, improving attention maps and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of high-norm tokens causing noisy attention in Vision Transformers without requiring retraining.

Method: Shift high-norm activations from identified neurons to an untrained token, mimicking register tokens' effect.

Result: Cleaner attention maps, improved downstream task performance, and comparable results to models trained with register tokens.

Conclusion: Test-time registers offer a training-free solution for pre-trained models, enhancing interpretability and performance.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of inter-subject variability in EMG signals, eliminating the need for time-consuming subject-specific calibration.

Method: Uses an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network to disentangle EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components.

Result: Achieves robust performance on unseen users, surpassing baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios.

Conclusion: Offers a calibration-free solution for cross-subject EMG recognition and potential for broader biometric applications.

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as task-independent biometric systems.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system.

Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning.

Motivation: Addressing the need for pixel-level segmentation of unseen categories across unseen domains, crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving in adverse conditions.

Method: Vireo uses frozen Visual Foundation Models and Depth VFMs for domain-invariant features. Key innovations include GeoText Prompts, CMPE, and DOV-VEH to align visual-textual modalities and enhance robustness.

Result: Vireo achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition.

Conclusion: Vireo offers a unified, scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse environments, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

TL;DR: RoCA is a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, improving generalizability and adaptation without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying E2E autonomous driving across domains, where existing methods like LLMs lack performance guarantees and incur high retraining costs.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution over tokens encoding vehicle information, using Gaussian processes to learn basis tokens and trajectories for diverse scenarios.

Result: RoCA enhances the base E2E model's generalizability and outperforms direct finetuning in domain adaptation.

Conclusion: RoCA achieves strong performance in cross-domain scenarios, offering robust generalization and adaptation for autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm, offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model, without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAC introduces a framework for generating adversarial CAPTCHAs using text prompts and LLMs, improving diversity and attack efficacy. BP-UAC optimizes for black-box scenarios, achieving high success rates with human-indistinguishable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to DNN attacks. Existing adversarial methods rely on original images, limiting applicability. UAC addresses this by generating adversarial examples from text prompts.

Method: UAC uses LLMs for CAPTCHA diversity and supports targeted (EDICT method) and untargeted (BP-UAC) attacks. BP-UAC employs multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for black-box scenarios.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates, generating CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Conclusion: UAC and BP-UAC effectively enhance CAPTCHA robustness and attack versatility, addressing limitations of traditional adversarial methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks. For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STRIDE, a spatio-temporal dataset for world modeling, and TARDIS, a transformer-based model, demonstrating strong performance in agent tasks like image synthesis and georeferencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments dynamically change across space and time, posing challenges for modeling. STRIDE and TARDIS aim to address these challenges.

Method: STRIDE permutes 360-degree imagery into interconnected nodes. TARDIS, a transformer-based model, integrates spatial and temporal dynamics autoregressively.

Result: Robust performance in tasks like image synthesis, instruction following, and georeferencing.

Conclusion: The approach advances generalist agents with enhanced spatial and temporal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwiftWRF introduces Gaussian splatting to wireless radiance fields, enabling fast and accurate reconstruction for tasks like localization and sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for wireless radiance field modeling lack accuracy or require strong priors, while NeRF-based approaches are computationally expensive.

Method: SwiftWRF uses deformable 2D Gaussian splatting with CUDA-accelerated rasterization and a lightweight MLP for deformation modeling.

Result: SwiftWRF achieves 500x faster reconstruction than state-of-the-art methods while improving signal quality.

Conclusion: SwiftWRF efficiently addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering real-time wireless radiance field modeling with high fidelity.

Abstract: Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its signal quality.

*Ziqing Zhou, Bin-Bin Gao, Yurui Pan, Lidong Wang, Wenbing Zhu, Yong Liu, Jun Liu, Mingmin Chi, Dong Wu, Bo Peng, Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pro-AD addresses the 'Soft Identity Mapping' problem in prototype-based anomaly detection by expanding prototypes and introducing a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder and Prototype-based Constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototype-based methods aggregate insufficient normal information, leading to poor reconstruction, while increasing prototypes risks reconstructing anomalies.

Method: Pro-AD uses an expanded set of prototypes and a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder to aggregate comprehensive normal information and reconstruct features. A Prototype-based Constraint prevents anomaly reconstruction.

Result: Pro-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Pro-AD effectively leverages prototypes to improve anomaly detection, demonstrating robustness and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction. However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

*Kshitij Kavimandan, Angelos Nalmpantis, Emma Beauxis-Aussalet, Robert-Jan Sips*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss method for patent image retrieval, leveraging the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system to improve relevance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent images are complex and current retrieval methods ignore hierarchical relationships like those in the LIC system, limiting accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that uses LIC's taxonomy to assign multiple positive pairs with varying similarity scores.

Result: Experiments on the DeepPatent2 dataset show improved retrieval performance, especially with low-parameter models.

Conclusion: The method enhances patent image retrieval by incorporating hierarchical relationships, offering efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited hardware.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the under-researched potential of masked-based autoregressive models for video generation and address challenges like long sequence modeling and high resource costs.

Method: Proposes VideoMAR with temporal causality, spatial bi-directionality, next-frame diffusion loss, temporal short-to-long curriculum learning, spatial progressive resolution training, and progressive temperature strategy.

Result: Outperforms Cosmos I2V on VBench-I2V benchmark with fewer parameters (9.3%), training data (0.5%), and GPU resources (0.2%).

Conclusion: VideoMAR efficiently bridges autoregressive models and video generation, demonstrating superior performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack a unified single-stage framework, struggle with performance-fusion balance, and have unreasonable modality weight allocation, limiting multispectral object detection accuracy.

Method: Based on YOLOv11, the framework introduces six fusion modes, a P3 mid-fusion strategy, and MCF for optimizing feature fusion and reducing redundancy.

Result: The framework achieves a 3.41%-5.65% mAP improvement on FLIR, reaching 47.61%, demonstrating enhanced adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-RGBT effectively addresses multispectral fusion challenges, improving detection accuracy and model performance, validated by experiments on major datasets.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection, which integrates information from multiple bands, can enhance detection accuracy and environmental adaptability, holding great application potential across various fields. Although existing methods have made progress in cross-modal interaction, low-light conditions, and model lightweight, there are still challenges like the lack of a unified single-stage framework, difficulty in balancing performance and fusion strategy, and unreasonable modality weight allocation. To address these, based on the YOLOv11 framework, we present YOLOv11-RGBT, a new comprehensive multimodal object detection framework. We designed six multispectral fusion modes and successfully applied them to models from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12 and RT-DETR. After reevaluating the importance of the two modalities, we proposed a P3 mid-fusion strategy and multispectral controllable fine-tuning (MCF) strategy for multispectral models. These improvements optimize feature fusion, reduce redundancy and mismatches, and boost overall model performance. Experiments show our framework excels on three major open-source multispectral object detection datasets, like LLVIP and FLIR. Particularly, the multispectral controllable fine-tuning strategy significantly enhanced model adaptability and robustness. On the FLIR dataset, it consistently improved YOLOv11 models' mAP by 3.41%-5.65%, reaching a maximum of 47.61%, verifying the framework and strategies' effectiveness.

*Maxwell J. Jacobson, Corey J. Maley, Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM integrates symbolic reasoning with neural generation for context-sensitive decisions in multi-modal data, outperforming classical logic and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic logic systems lack nuance and grounding in multi-modal environments, while neural networks lack interpretable reasoning structures. CALM bridges this gap.

Method: CALM uses domain trees for predicates, refining analog truth values with neural networks and symbolic reasoning to ensure constraints.

Result: CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy in object placement tasks, surpassing classical logic (86.3%) and LLMs (59.4%), and aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: CALM combines logic precision with neural multi-modal processing, paving the way for robust, interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM). CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural networks.

Method: The study models single-satellite operations and extends to multi-satellite constellations using MARL, evaluating algorithms like PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO in a realistic simulation.

Result: MARL effectively balances imaging and resource management, handling non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

Conclusion: The findings support autonomous satellite operations, offering guidelines for policy learning in decentralised EO missions.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring, disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for continual learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings are limited by CPU-based computation, creating bottlenecks and restricting task sequences.

Method: MEAL leverages JAX for GPU acceleration, allowing efficient learning across long task sequences (100 tasks) on standard hardware.

Result: Naive combinations of CL and MARL methods perform well in simple environments but fail in complex settings requiring coordination and adaptation.

Conclusion: MEAL identifies key architectural and algorithmic features essential for effective CMARL, providing a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation. Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical for CMARL on MEAL.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in decision-making, coordination, and task execution.

We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation.

TL;DR: T-PPO improves PPO's efficiency for training LLMs by truncating responses and optimizing computations, achieving 2.5x faster training without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's inefficiency due to long response generation and low hardware utilization motivates the need for a more efficient method like T-PPO.

Method: T-PPO introduces Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) and a mechanism for independent policy and value model optimization, reducing redundant computations.

Result: T-PPO achieves up to 2.5x faster training efficiency on a 32B model while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: T-PPO is a promising advancement for efficient RL-based training of reasoning LLMs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors.

TL;DR: HeurAgenix is a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework using LLMs to evolve and select heuristics for combinatorial optimization, outperforming existing methods and matching specialized solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic designs for combinatorial optimization rely on manual expertise and lack generalization. HeurAgenix aims to automate and improve heuristic selection and evolution.

Method: HeurAgenix uses LLMs to evolve heuristics by comparing solutions and extracting strategies, then dynamically selects heuristics during problem-solving. A dual-reward mechanism fine-tunes the selector for robustness.

Result: HeurAgenix outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or exceeds specialized solvers in benchmarks.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating heuristic design and selection for combinatorial optimization, offering flexibility and robustness.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements. However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. 
By converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. 
Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing computational offloading and resource allocation.

*Ruoyu Wang, Xinshu Li, Chen Wang, Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), a method that improves visual navigation by modeling causal relationships in sequential data, outperforming baselines without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods process historical observations simultaneously, ignoring internal causal structures, which limits performance. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The proposed CAN framework includes a Causal Understanding Module to model causal relationships in sequential navigation data.

Result: CAN consistently outperforms baselines in various tasks and environments, with gains attributed to the Causal Understanding Module.

Conclusion: The CAN framework effectively enhances navigation performance by leveraging causal relationships, generalizing well across learning settings without extra computation.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Embodied Web Agents, a new AI paradigm integrating physical and digital intelligence, with a benchmark for tasks like cooking and navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are siloed, limiting their ability to solve tasks requiring both physical and digital intelligence.

Method: Developed a unified simulation platform integrating 3D environments and web interfaces, and created a benchmark for cross-domain tasks.

Result: Revealed performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI and humans, highlighting challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for AI agents that bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning, with public resources for further research.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FA is complex and knowledge-intensive; integrating AI can automate tasks like anomaly detection, case retrieval, and report generation, but orchestrating multiple AI models is challenging.

Method: Design and implementation of an LPA combining LLMs with planning capabilities and external tools to autonomously process queries, retrieve data, and generate responses.

Result: Evaluation shows the LPA is effective and reliable in supporting FA tasks.

Conclusion: The LPA successfully addresses the challenge of orchestrating AI models in FA workflows, enhancing efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical meta-representation called the Structural Temporal Graph (STG) for analyzing music at multiple levels, introduces a method to derive structural summaries of music corpora, and validates the approach through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Western music's hierarchical structure requires a unified representation for holistic analysis across granularities.

Method: Develops the STG for individual pieces, formulates corpus summarization as an NP-hard problem, uses simulated annealing for structural distance, and combines SMT solvers with nested annealing for centroid STG derivation.

Result: Experiments confirm structural distance differentiates pieces and centroids accurately represent corpora.

Conclusion: The STG and proposed methods enable effective hierarchical analysis and summarization of music corpora.

Abstract: Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.

### [221] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear, Rachel Guo, Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for creating natural language state representations for LLM agents in multi-agent games, highlighting the impact of state representation on behavior and comparability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ad hoc and inconsistent approaches in encoding game history for LLM agents, which obscure behavioral impacts and limit study comparability.

Method: A framework categorizing state representation along three axes: action informativeness, reward informativeness, and prompting style. Applied to a dynamic selfish routing game.

Result: LLM agent behavior depends on state representation. Summarized history, regret-focused rewards, and limited action info yield behavior closer to game theory equilibrium.

Conclusion: State representation significantly influences LLM agent behavior, with certain representations aligning better with theoretical predictions and stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI Policy Module for CS curricula to address gaps in preparing students for AI ethics and policy challenges, showing positive results in student attitudes and confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CS curricula lack preparation for AI practitioners to integrate ethical principles and policy into AI development, necessitating educational interventions.

Method: Developed and piloted an AI Policy Module, including a technical assignment on AI regulation, and evaluated student attitudes via pre- and post-module surveys.

Result: Students showed increased concern about AI ethics and greater confidence in discussing AI regulation after the module.

Conclusion: The AI Policy Module effectively prepares students for ethical and policy challenges in AI, with the AI Regulation Assignment being a key tool.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys. Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing ethical challenges.

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiency in large reasoning models (LRMs) due to overthinking and proposes two lightweight methods to enhance efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs exhibit overthinking, generating verbose and redundant content, which reduces efficiency and increases inference costs. The study aims to uncover and mitigate this inefficiency.

Method: Two methods are introduced: (1) Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique, and (2) Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that rewards concise correct solutions.

Result: Experiments on seven LRM backbones show significant reduction in reasoning length while maintaining or improving task performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LRMs' intrinsic capabilities can be leveraged to improve reasoning efficiency through self-guided methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work, we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency, revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning. Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

TL;DR: LLM-based AI like ChatGPT reshapes labor markets by displacing jobs and intensifying competition, especially in programming tasks, while enabling skill transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of general-purpose AI (e.g., ChatGPT) on labor markets, particularly how it affects demand, supply, and skill transitions.

Method: Analysis of data from an online labor platform to observe displacement effects, demand-supply changes, and skill transitions in submarkets aligned with LLM functionalities.

Result: Pronounced displacement in skill-aligned submarkets, with supply declining less than demand, intensifying competition. High-skilled freelancers disproportionately shift to programming tasks.

Conclusion: General-purpose AI displaces certain jobs but also induces skill transitions, with implications for policymakers, platforms, and workers.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate zero-shot learning capabilities across a wide range of downstream tasks. Owing to their general-purpose nature and potential to augment or even automate job functions, these systems are poised to reshape labor market dynamics. However, predicting their precise impact \textit{a priori} is challenging, given AI's simultaneous effects on both demand and supply, as well as the strategic responses of market participants. Leveraging an extensive dataset from a leading online labor platform, we document a pronounced displacement effect and an overall contraction in submarkets where required skills closely align with core LLM functionalities. Although demand and supply both decline, the reduction in supply is comparatively smaller, thereby intensifying competition among freelancers. Notably, further analysis shows that this heightened competition is especially pronounced in programming-intensive submarkets. This pattern is attributed to skill-transition effects: by lowering the human-capital barrier to programming, ChatGPT enables incumbent freelancers to enter programming tasks. Moreover, these transitions are not homogeneous, with high-skilled freelancers contributing disproportionately to the shift. Our findings illuminate the multifaceted impacts of general-purpose AI on labor markets, highlighting not only the displacement of certain occupations but also the inducement of skill transitions within the labor supply. These insights offer practical implications for policymakers, platform operators, and workers.

Motivation: HTR poses unique challenges due to variability and context needs, and SSL's potential for HTR remains underexplored.

Result: Demonstrates advancements in SSL for HTR across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Spatial Context-based SSL is effective for HTR, offering state-of-the-art improvements.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a relevant problem in computer vision, and implies unique challenges owing to its inherent variability and the rich contextualization required for its interpretation. Despite the success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in computer vision, its application to HTR has been rather scattered, leaving key SSL methodologies unexplored. This work focuses on one of them, namely Spatial Context-based SSL. We investigate how this family of approaches can be adapted and optimized for HTR and propose new workflows that leverage the unique features of handwritten text. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods considered lead to advancements in the state-of-the-art of SSL for HTR in a number of benchmark cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel diverse planning approach using an n-dimensional grid for expressive diversity modeling and a toolkit called Behaviour Planning, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diverse planning methods are limited in encoding and explaining diversity, restricting their applicability.

Method: Proposes an n-dimensional grid representation for diversity and a toolkit (Behaviour Planning) using planning-as-satisfiability.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Behaviour Planning outperforms current methods in generating diverse plans and supports broader planning categories.

Conclusion: The approach advances diverse planning by enabling expressive, customizable diversity models and broader applicability.

Abstract: Diverse planning approaches are utilised in real-world applications like risk management, automated streamed data analysis, and malware detection. The current diverse planning formulations encode the diversity model as a distance function, which is computational inexpensive when comparing two plans. However, such modelling approach limits what can be encoded as measure of diversity, as well as the ability to explain why two plans are different. This paper introduces a novel approach to the diverse planning problem, allowing for more expressive modelling of diversity using a n-dimensional grid representation, where each dimension corresponds to a user-defined feature. Furthermore, we present a novel toolkit that generates diverse plans based on such customisable diversity models, called \emph{Behaviour Planning}. We provide an implementation for behaviour planning using planning-as-satisfiability. An empirical evaluation of our implementation shows that behaviour planning significantly outperforms the current diverse planning method in generating diverse plans measured on our new customisable diversity models. Our implementation is the first diverse planning approach to support planning categories beyond classical planning, such as over-subscription and numerical planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic nature of the Semantic Web and the limitations of current OV approaches due to growing ontology sizes and manual errors necessitate a more efficient solution.

Method: The paper introduces the OM4OV pipeline, reformulates OV tasks from an OM perspective, and proposes the cross-reference mechanism to optimize performance.

Result: Experimental validation on OAEI datasets confirms the effectiveness of the OM4OV pipeline and cross-reference mechanism.

Conclusion: The approach successfully leverages OM for OV tasks, though some detected false mappings may not be incorrect.

Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary to capture time-varying information, particularly for widely used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose yet another approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation and measurement for OV tasks. Building upon the prior alignment(s) from OM, we propose a pipeline optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism to enhance overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in the OV tested originating from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also discuss insights into OM used for OV tasks, where some false mappings detected by OV systems are not actually untrue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack the ability to compute the Wasserstein distance between probability distributions represented by PCs, despite tractable divergence computations for certain PC classes.

Method: Proposes a Wasserstein-type distance with coupling restricted to PCs, solves via small linear programs, and derives tractability conditions. Also introduces an iterative algorithm for empirical Wasserstein distance minimization.

Result: The framework allows tractable computation of the Wasserstein distance and retrieval of optimal transport plans between PCs. Empirical results show efficient parameter estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed method fills a gap in PC-based optimal transport, offering tractable solutions and practical applications in parameter estimation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits (PCs). While it has been shown recently that divergences between distributions represented as certain classes of PCs can be computed tractably, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing approach to compute the Wasserstein distance between probability distributions given by PCs. We propose a Wasserstein-type distance that restricts the coupling measure of the associated optimal transport problem to be a probabilistic circuit. We then develop an algorithm for computing this distance by solving a series of small linear programs and derive the circuit conditions under which this is tractable. Furthermore, we show that we can easily retrieve the optimal transport plan between the PCs from the solutions to these linear programs. Lastly, we study the empirical Wasserstein distance between a PC and a dataset, and show that we can estimate the PC parameters to minimize this distance through an efficient iterative algorithm.

TL;DR: LSPO combines game-theoretic methods with LLM fine-tuning to improve strategic language agents for games like Werewolf, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with strategic language games due to intrinsic bias and limited exploration of text action space.

Method: LSPO maps utterances to a latent strategy space, applies CFR for policy optimization, and fine-tunes LLM with DPO.

Result: LSPO agents outperform existing Werewolf agents by iteratively improving strategic reasoning and language communication.

Conclusion: LSPO is effective for free-form language games requiring strategic interactions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various domains like open-ended conversation and multi-step decision-making. However, it remains challenging for these agents to solve strategic language games, such as Werewolf, which demand both strategic decision-making and free-form language interactions. Existing LLM agents often suffer from intrinsic bias in their action distributions and limited exploration of the unbounded text action space, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Space Policy Optimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that combines game-theoretic methods with LLM fine-tuning to build strategic language agents. LSPO leverages the observation that while the language space is combinatorially large, the underlying strategy space is relatively compact. We first map free-form utterances into a finite latent strategy space, yielding an abstracted extensive-form game. Then we apply game-theoretic methods like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) to optimize the policy in the latent space. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with the learned policy. By iteratively alternating between these steps, our LSPO agents progressively enhance both strategic reasoning and language communication. Experiment on the Werewolf game shows that our agents iteratively expand the strategy space with improving performance and outperform existing Werewolf agents, underscoring their effectiveness in free-form language games with strategic interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for solving SMC problems are slow due to frequent solver invocations, and approximate solvers may violate constraints.

Method: KOCO-SMC integrates SAT and probabilistic inference solvers, tracking bounds to enable early inference with partial assignments.

Result: KOCO-SMC finds exact solutions faster than existing approximate and exact solvers in experiments.

Conclusion: KOCO-SMC offers a significant efficiency improvement for exact SMC problem solving.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Counting (SMC) is a recently proposed general language to reason about problems integrating statistical and symbolic Artificial Intelligence. An SMC problem is an extended SAT problem in which the truth values of a few Boolean variables are determined by probabilistic inference. Approximate solvers may return solutions that violate constraints. Directly integrating available SAT solvers and probabilistic inference solvers gives exact solutions but results in slow performance because of many back-and-forth invocations of both solvers. We propose KOCO-SMC, an integrated exact SMC solver that efficiently tracks lower and upper bounds in the probabilistic inference process. It enhances computational efficiency by enabling early estimation of probabilistic inference using only partial variable assignments, whereas existing methods require full variable assignments. In the experiment, we compare KOCO-SMC with currently available approximate and exact SMC solvers on large-scale datasets and real-world applications. The proposed KOCO-SMC finds exact solutions with much less time.

TL;DR: Entro-duction dynamically adjusts exploration depth in multi-step reasoning using entropy metrics, improving flexibility and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for deciding exploration depth in LLMs are costly and inflexible, limiting performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Entro-duction, which monitors output entropy and variance entropy to dynamically adjust exploration depth (deepen, expand, or stop).

Result: Effective across four benchmark datasets, balancing reasoning accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Conclusion: Entro-duction offers a flexible, cost-effective solution for optimizing multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-step processes via large language models (LLMs) have proven effective for solving complex reasoning tasks. However, the depth of exploration of the reasoning procedure can significantly affect the task performance. Existing methods to automatically decide the depth often lead to high cost and a lack of flexibility. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two features to capture the model's uncertainty of the current step and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed entropy changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand, or stop exploration according to the probability, which facilitates the trade-off between the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Entro-duction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity is a major cause of drug development failure, yet molecular toxicity repair lacks systematic definition and benchmarking.

Method: ToxiMol provides a standardized dataset and prompt annotation pipeline. ToxiEval integrates toxicity prediction, synthetic accessibility, and structural similarity for evaluation.

Result: Current MLLMs show promising capabilities in toxicity understanding and molecule editing but face significant challenges.

Conclusion: ToxiMol fills a gap in benchmarking molecular toxicity repair, highlighting MLLMs' potential and areas for improvement.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: The paper critiques data-driven AI in patient care, advocating for a purpose-driven approach grounded in clinical theory and sociotechnical realities to improve outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the limitations of repurposing real-world patient datasets for AI-driven automation and propose a better approach.

Method: Reflects on data analysis history and suggests integrating systems thinking and clinical theory into model development.

Result: Proposes a purpose-driven ML paradigm that considers data generation and automation objectives for better patient care.

Conclusion: A purpose-driven approach to AI development offers new opportunities and promises improved automation in patient care.

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

### [234] [The NordDRG AI Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13790)
*Tapio Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NordDRG-AI-Benchmark is the first public benchmark for evaluating LLMs in hospital funding via DRG logic, multilingual diagnosis, and procedure coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open benchmarks for LLMs in clinical coding and decision support at the hospital funding layer, specifically for DRG reimbursement.

Method: The benchmark includes definition tables, expert manuals, and a prompt pack with 14 CaseMix tasks, testing LLMs on code lookup, cross-table inference, and multilingual terminology.

Result: Five LLMs were tested, with o3 scoring 9/9, GPT-4o and o4-mini-high scoring 7/9, and Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash scoring 5/9 and 3/9, respectively.

Conclusion: NordDRG-AI-Benchmark reveals domain-specific LLM strengths and weaknesses, providing a reproducible baseline for trustworthy automation in hospital funding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are already being piloted for clinical coding and decision support. However, until now, no open benchmark has targeted the hospital funding layer where Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) determine reimbursement across many countries. We release NordDRG-AI-Benchmark, the first public test-bed that captures a complete DRG rule set and evaluates an LLM's ability to reason over multilingual diagnosis, procedure, and tariff logic.
  The benchmark bundles three classes of artefacts: (i) definition tables with 20 interlinked tables covering DRG logic, ICD and NCSP codes, age/sex splits, and country flags; (ii) expert manuals and changelog templates describing real governance workflows; and (iii) a prompt pack of 14 CaseMix tasks that span code lookup, cross-table inference, multilingual terminology, and quality-assurance audits.
  All artefacts are available at: https://github.com/longshoreforrest/norddrg-ai-benchmark
  A baseline demonstration shows that five state-of-the-art LLMs perform very differently on the nine automatically verifiable tasks: o3 (OpenAI) scores 9 out of 9, GPT-4o and o4-mini-high score 7 out of 9, while Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash solve only 5 out of 9 and 3 out of 9, respectively. These results confirm that NordDRG-AI-Benchmark highlights domain-specific strengths and weaknesses that remain hidden in generic LLM benchmarks, offering a reproducible baseline for research on trustworthy automation in hospital funding.

### [235] [pycnet-audio: A Python package to support bioacoustics data processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14864)
*Zachary J. Ruff, Damon B. Lesmeister*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Passive acoustic monitoring uses ARUs to record wildlife sounds, requiring automated processing for large datasets. pycnet-audio, built around PNW-Cnet, offers a workflow for detecting vocalizations and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient processing of large acoustic datasets from wildlife monitoring, as manual review is impractical.

Method: Deploy ARUs to record audio, then use pycnet-audio and PNW-Cnet for automated detection of target signals.

Result: PNW-Cnet detects vocalizations of ~80 species and various noise types, expanding its utility.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio provides a practical solution for processing acoustic data, enhancing wildlife research efficiency.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs). The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

*Md Jahangir Alam Khondkar, Ajan Ahmed, Masudul Haider Imtiaz, Stephanie Schuckers*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This study benchmarks three speech enhancement models (Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, U-Net) on diverse datasets, revealing U-Net excels in noise suppression, CMGAN in perceptual quality, and Wave-U-Net in speaker feature retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in comparative performance evaluation of deep learning models for speech enhancement, particularly in balancing noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation.

Method: Benchmarking Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net on SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets, evaluating noise suppression (SNR), perceptual quality (PESQ), and speaker feature retention (VeriSpeak scores).

Result: U-Net showed high noise suppression (+71.96% SNR on SpEAR), CMGAN achieved top perceptual quality (PESQ 4.04 on SpEAR), and Wave-U-Net balanced speaker feature retention (+10.84% VeriSpeak on SpEAR).

Conclusion: Advanced methods can optimize trade-offs in speech enhancement, benefiting applications like voice biometrics, forensic audio, and telecommunication in noisy environments.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.

TL;DR: An OCR-based speech synthesis system is developed for visually impaired individuals to access books of their choice, overcoming limitations of Braille and audio recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face limited access to books due to reliance on Braille and audio recordings. Speech is a more effective communication mode for them.

Method: The system uses OCR technology implemented in LabVIEW to convert text to speech.

Result: The developed system is accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly.

Conclusion: The OCR-based speech synthesis system provides a practical solution for visually impaired individuals to access books independently.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

### [238] [SonicVerse: Multi-Task Learning for Music Feature-Informed Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15154)
*Anuradha Chopra, Abhinaba Roy, Dorien Herremans*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SonicVerse is a multi-task music captioning model that generates detailed captions by integrating music feature detection tasks, improving caption quality and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich music databases and advance music AI research by creating accurate, descriptive captions for music pieces.

Method: Uses a projection-based architecture to transform audio into language tokens while detecting music features via auxiliary heads, enhancing captioning input.

Result: Incorporating music features improves caption quality and detail, enabling rich descriptions for both short and long music pieces.

Conclusion: SonicVerse effectively combines music feature detection with caption generation, enhancing the descriptiveness and utility of music captions.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

### [239] [Exploiting Music Source Separation for Automatic Lyrics Transcription with Whisper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15514)
*Jaza Syed, Ivan Meresman Higgs, Ondřej Cífka, Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of music source separation on automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) using Whisper, an ASR model, showing improved performance with proposed methods for short-form and long-form tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in ASR, ALT remains challenging due to musical interference. The effect of source separation on ALT performance is not well-studied.

Method: Uses Whisper to evaluate ALT performance on original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems. Proposes concatenation for short-form and a vocal activity detection algorithm for long-form tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Jam-ALT benchmark and introduces MUSDB-ALT dataset.

Conclusion: Source separation improves ALT performance, with proposed methods reducing WER, and the new dataset supports future research.

Abstract: Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) remains a challenging task in the field of music information retrieval, despite great advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) brought about by transformer-based architectures in recent years. One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering audio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent advances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of high-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance. However, the effect of source separation has not been systematically investigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work examines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a state-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and long-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation method that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For long-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity detector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction in WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT benchmark, without any training or fine-tuning. We also publish MUSDB-ALT, the first dataset of long-form lyric transcripts following the Jam-ALT guidelines for which vocal stems are publicly available.

*Teysir Baoueb, Xiaoyu Bie, Xi Wang, Gaël Richard*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for instrument editing in text-to-music diffusion models without additional training, preserving content while changing timbre.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling text-to-music generation for specific outcomes is challenging due to sensitivity to text prompts and random seeds.

Method: Leverages a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model, using an intermediate timestep identified by an instrument classifier to balance content preservation and timbre change.

Result: Achieves instrument editing without compromising generation speed or requiring extra training.

Conclusion: The approach effectively edits instruments in existing audio tracks while maintaining the original content.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge. Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's speed.

*Junyan Jiang, Daniel Chin, Liwei Lin, Xuanjie Liu, Gus Xia*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified music-for-music sequence modeling approach using pretrained LMs and lightweight adapters for tasks like chord recognition and melody generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many music AI models rely on human-defined labels, but annotations like chords can be expressed within music itself, enabling unified understanding and generation tasks.

Method: Utilize pretrained LMs for reference and target sequences, linking them via lightweight adapters for parameter efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior performance in tasks like chord recognition, melody generation, and drum track generation.

Conclusion: The method effectively unifies diverse music tasks under a single paradigm, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Many music AI models learn a map between music content and human-defined labels. However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model (LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are publicly available.

*Kentaro Seki, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Takaaki Saeki, Hiroshi Saruwatari*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: TTSOps is an automated closed-loop framework for building multi-speaker TTS systems from noisy web-scale data, outperforming traditional methods in naturalness and speaker diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional TTS systems require high-quality curated data, limiting scalability and diversity. TTSOps leverages modern TTS models' noise robustness and low-quality yet informative samples.

Method: TTSOps integrates automated data collection, dynamic data cleansing, and evaluation-in-the-loop selection using predicted MOS, optimizing both corpus and model in a closed loop.

Result: Experiments on Japanese YouTube data show TTSOps surpasses acoustic-quality-based baselines in speech naturalness and speaker diversity.

Conclusion: TTSOps effectively addresses scalability and diversity challenges in TTS by leveraging noisy data and closed-loop optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents TTSOps, a fully automated closed-loop framework for constructing multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems from noisy, uncurated web-scale speech data, often referred to as ``dark data,'' such as online videos. Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with high acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits scalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent studies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they often overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS models to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality yet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a data-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1) automated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic selection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3) evaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean opinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance. Furthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a closed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data cleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive experiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms conventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and speaker diversity of synthesized speech.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MERGE, three new datasets for Music Emotion Recognition (MER), addressing the lack of quality bimodal (audio-lyrics) data. It validates their viability with experiments, achieving an 81.74% F1-score for bimodal classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of public, sizable, and quality-controlled bimodal (audio-lyrics) datasets has hindered progress in MER. This paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: Proposes MERGE datasets (audio, lyrics, bimodal) using a semi-automatic approach. Conducts experiments with feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning, and proposes fixed train-validation-test splits.

Result: Achieves an 81.74% F1-score for bimodal classification, confirming the datasets' viability.

Conclusion: The MERGE datasets are viable and provide a benchmark for future MER research, particularly for bimodal systems.

Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a lack of public, sizable and quality-controlled bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively referred to as MERGE, which were created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. Additionally, we propose and validate fixed train-validation-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 81.74\% F1-score for bimodal classification.

TL;DR: A multi-stage pipeline combining a Bird Song Detector and local classification models improves bird species identification in Doñana National Park, outperforming general tools like BirdNET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases in BirdNET's training data and challenges like overlapping vocalizations or absence of target species in recordings for accurate bird identification in specific ecosystems.

Method: Deployed AudioMoth recorders in nine locations across three habitats, manually annotated 461 minutes of audio, and developed a pipeline with a Bird Song Detector followed by local classification models.

Result: The pipeline, especially with fine-tuned BirdNET, outperformed the baseline, showing better species identification when analyzing detected bird segments.

Conclusion: Integrating a detector with local models adapts general tools to specific ecological needs, aiding conservation by tracking bird species sensitive to environmental changes.

Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring is a key tool for biodiversity conservation, but the large volumes of unsupervised audio it generates present major challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning offers promising solutions. BirdNET, a widely used bird identification model, has shown success in many study systems but is limited at local scale due to biases in its training data, which focus on specific locations and target sounds rather than entire soundscapes. A key challenge in bird species identification is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations, complicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Doñana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We deployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and manually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments spanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird vocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were classified using custom models trained at the local scale. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of detector and fine-tuned BirdNET outperformed the baseline without detection. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with local classification models. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools to specific ecological challenges. Automatically detecting bird species helps track the health of this threatened ecosystem, given birds sensitivity to environmental change, and supports conservation planning to reduce biodiversity loss.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset for film music generation, and a video adapter to enhance pre-trained models, improving performance in film music tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current music generation systems lack integration of filmmaking nuances like visual content and emotional tone, due to insufficient datasets.

Method: OSSL dataset (36.5 hours of movie clips with soundtracks and mood annotations) and a video adapter for a transformer-based model.

Result: Improved MusicGen-Medium performance in fidelity and subjective compatibility (mood/genre).

Conclusion: OSSL and the video adapter effectively address film music generation challenges, with dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music for a scene. This limitation primarily stems from the absence of comprehensive datasets that integrate these elements. To address this gap, we introduce Open Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre. The dataset and code are available at https://havenpersona.github.io/ossl-v1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making is complex and influenced by biases and incomplete information. Current LLM usage lacks the interactivity needed for real-world medical practice.

Method: Proposed MedSyn, a framework for multi-step, interactive dialogues between physicians and LLMs, allowing dynamic exchanges and challenge of suggestions.

Result: Open-source LLMs demonstrated promise as physician assistants in simulated interactions.

Conclusion: MedSyn shows potential for improving clinical decisions; future work will validate its impact on diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes with real physicians.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

*Corentin Delacour, M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb, Joao P. Hespanha, Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 2D parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) to improve sampling in constrained Ising problems, eliminating the need for penalty strength tuning and enhancing mixing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling Boltzmann distributions is crucial in machine learning and optimization, but practical Ising machine implementations face challenges with soft constraints.

Method: Extends parallel tempering (PT) by adding a second dimension of replicas that interpolate penalty strengths, ensuring constraint satisfaction and better mixing.

Result: 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing (KL divergence decays as O(1/t)) and significant speedup over conventional PT in graph sparsification and Wishart instances.

Conclusion: 2D-PT is broadly applicable to constrained Ising problems and compatible with existing Ising machines, offering a practical solution to constraint handling.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

*Yao Zhang, Hewei Gao, Haokun Chen, Weiguo Li, Yunpu Ma, Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNano is a federated learning framework for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that centralizes the LLM on the server and uses lightweight client modules (NanoEdge) to reduce storage and communication costs while handling data heterogeneity and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face deployment challenges due to distributed data and privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a solution, but existing FL methods are impractical for large-scale MLLMs due to high computational and communication demands.

Method: FedNano centralizes the LLM on the server and introduces NanoEdge, a lightweight client module with modality-specific encoders, connectors, and NanoAdapters using low-rank adaptation. This avoids deploying full LLMs on clients.

Result: FedNano reduces client-side storage by 95% and communication overhead to 0.01% of model parameters, outperforming prior FL baselines in handling heterogeneous data and resource constraints.

Conclusion: FedNano bridges the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

*Joseph Geraci, Bessi Qorri, Christian Cumbaa, Mike Tsay, Paul Leonczyk, Luca Pani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NetraAI, a dynamical system-based AI framework for stability and interpretability in small clinical datasets, and compares it with DeepSeek-V3, a large-scale LLM. NetraAI combines contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient subgroups, achieving high accuracy with few features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and stable AI models in clinical settings, especially for small datasets, by leveraging dynamical systems and evolutionary learning.

Method: NetraAI uses contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to embed features in a metric space, iteratively contracting them toward stable attractors. It includes a pseudo-temporal embedding and an evolutionary loop for feature selection, guided by an LLM Strategist.

Result: NetraAI transformed weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers (AUC ~0.50-0.68 to high accuracy) using few features in case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer).

Conclusion: NetraAI represents a novel, interpretable AI framework at the intersection of dynamical systems and evolutionary learning, offering reliable clinical insights and aligning with emerging reasoning paradigms like JEPA.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized "species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ETS, a framework combining EEG and eye-tracking for open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of decoding open-vocabulary natural language from noisy EEG data, where traditional methods fail.

Method: Integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data for text generation and sentiment classification.

Result: Superior performance in BLEU/Rouge scores for text generation and 10% F1 improvement in sentiment classification.

Conclusion: ETS shows potential for high-performance open-vocabulary EEG-to-text systems across diverse subjects and data sources.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1) open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

### [251] [Predicting Onflow Parameters Using Transfer Learning for Domain and Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14784)
*Emre Yilmaz, Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transfer learning method using ConvNet is proposed to predict onflow parameters (angle of attack and speed) from surface pressure data, addressing challenges like sensor faults and data distribution changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional direct measurements of onflow parameters face issues like sensor faults. A data-driven, real-time learning approach is needed for applications like wind tunnel monitoring and aerodynamic performance tracking.

Method: Train a ConvNet offline, freeze most weights, and retrain selected layers for transfer learning. Tested on steady CFD data for domain and task adaptation.

Result: The method adapts well to changing data distributions, domain extensions, and task updates but struggles with noisy data.

Conclusion: Transfer learning with ConvNet is effective for predicting onflow parameters in dynamic environments, though noise remains a challenge.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy data is concluded to be not as effective.

Motivation: Traditional MARL methods are weak against coordinated adversarial attacks in cooperative settings.

Conclusion: The Wolfpack attack and WALL framework effectively address MARL vulnerabilities, enhancing robustness.

Abstract: Traditional robust methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) often struggle against coordinated adversarial attacks in cooperative scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose the Wolfpack Adversarial Attack framework, inspired by wolf hunting strategies, which targets an initial agent and its assisting agents to disrupt cooperation. Additionally, we introduce the Wolfpack-Adversarial Learning for MARL (WALL) framework, which trains robust MARL policies to defend against the proposed Wolfpack attack by fostering systemwide collaboration. Experimental results underscore the devastating impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements achieved by WALL.

TL;DR: PIPE, a physics-informed positional encoding method, enhances multimodal time series forecasting by embedding physical information into vision language models, improving accuracy by 12% in typhoon intensity forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches neglect visual data in time series, missing critical physical information like temporal and geospatial context in satellite imagery.

Method: PIPE introduces physics-informed positional indexing and variant-frequency positional encoding to embed physical and sequential order information.

Result: PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior methods.

Conclusion: PIPE effectively bridges the gap in multimodal forecasting by leveraging physical information, demonstrating superior accuracy and alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works.

*Funing Li, Yuan Tian, Ruben Noortwyck, Jifeng Zhou, Liming Kuang, Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning framework using GNN and Transformer is proposed to optimize retrieval in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous items, minimizing tardiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address retrieval challenges in multi-deep AVS/RS due to lane blockages, especially with heterogeneous items, to enhance flexibility and efficiency.

Method: Graph-based state representation with GNN for local topology and item attributes, combined with Transformer for global priority assignments.

Result: Outperforms heuristic methods in minimizing retrieval tardiness and adapts to diverse warehouse layouts.

Conclusion: The framework effectively optimizes retrieval operations, offering a scalable solution for heterogeneous multi-deep storage systems.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available, detailed T1D datasets limits progress in personalized therapy and glucose prediction models.

Method: AZT1D includes data from 25 T1D patients on AID systems, covering CGM, insulin pump data, carbs, and device modes over 6-8 weeks.

Result: The dataset provides rare granular details on bolus insulin delivery, supporting diverse AI/ML applications.

Conclusion: AZT1D enhances T1D research by enabling better clinical decision-making and individualized care through rich, naturalistic data.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data, carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [256] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan, Ming Jin, Yuanpeng He, Yuxuan Liang, Yong Deng, Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP) to address recurring concept drift in time series by storing and retrieving forecasters for different concepts, enhancing prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift causes forgetting of previously learned patterns, reducing prediction accuracy. Existing methods update parameters but may lose knowledge and lack retention mechanisms.

Method: CEP stores forecasters for different concepts, retrieves the nearest forecaster to test samples, and evolves new models for new concepts while clearing outdated knowledge.

Result: Experiments show CEP effectively retains knowledge of different concepts and improves prediction accuracy in recurring concept scenarios.

Conclusion: CEP successfully addresses recurring concept drift by retaining and utilizing past knowledge, significantly enhancing online forecasting results.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept. Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the prediction results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Injecting dropout at inference in PLMs like ESM2 boosts zero-shot performance on ProteinGym without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance zero-shot prediction of protein properties without modifying the PLM.

Method: Add a dropout layer (0.1 rate) between the embedding and transformer layers during inference, averaging outputs like Monte-Carlo dropout.

Result: Improved zero-shot performance on ProteinGym dataset.

Conclusion: Simple dropout injection at inference enhances PLM performance without training changes.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Assembly-of-Experts' (AoE), a method to efficiently create functional child models from Mixture-of-Experts parent models by interpolating weights, reducing computational costs and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining of LLMs is computationally expensive (10^13-10^15 FLOPs per 8-bit weight). AoE aims to leverage existing pretrained models more efficiently.

Method: AoE interpolates individual weight tensors from parent models to create child variants, enabling gradual or sharp trait transitions. No fine-tuning or distillation is needed.

Result: The method produces functional child models (e.g., DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera') with inherited intelligence and improved efficiency (40% fewer output tokens, V3 speed).

Conclusion: AoE is a scalable, efficient way to generate capable child models from existing pretrained ones, with surprising compactness and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed. Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

TL;DR: The paper explores the tradeoff between structured and selective internal representations in intelligent systems, deriving universal limits on generalization and identification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental constraints on how models balance generalization and input identity preservation.

Method: Derived closed-form expressions for generalization and identification probabilities, extended to noisy and heterogeneous spaces, and validated with minimal ReLU networks and complex models like CNNs and vision-language models.

Result: Revealed a universal Pareto front for the tradeoff, a sharp collapse in multi-input capacity, and a non-monotonic optimum for generalization. Empirical results matched theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental constraint, shaping representational capacity in both deep networks and biological systems.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective -- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains alike.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba is a versatile and efficient alternative to Transformer-based models for time-series forecasting.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based models in time-series forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continuous-time approximation for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, explicitly accounting for discretization error, and applies it to study implicit regularization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete optimization methods and their continuous-time approximations, focusing on the Heavy-Ball momentum method and its discretization error.

Method: Designs a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation with counter terms to explicitly model discretization error, enabling control to arbitrary step size order.

Result: Provides a continuous-time model for the Heavy-Ball method with controlled discretization error and demonstrates its application in implicit regularization for deep learning.

Conclusion: The work offers theoretical tools for analyzing momentum methods and shows practical implications in deep learning, supported by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PARC, a framework to analyze prompt sensitivity in Vision Language Models (VLMs), showing they inherit instability from LLMs and identifying robust models like InternVL2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if VLMs inherit prompt sensitivity from LLMs and identify which prompt variations and models are most affected.

Method: PARC framework includes plausible prompt variations, a reliability score, and calibration for cross-dataset analysis.

Result: VLMs show language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain; InternVL2 models are notably robust.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity in VLMs is linked to training data, and PARC provides a tool for analyzing it.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models, outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to training data.

Motivation: Traditional models struggle with frequent zero-demand periods, impacting inventory management in supply chains.

Method: Proposes a Model-Router framework using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers to assign forecasting strategies based on demand patterns.

Result: InceptionTime router improves accuracy by 11.8% (NWRMSLE) and speeds up inference by 4.67x on the Favorita dataset.

Conclusion: The framework enhances forecasting precision, reducing stockouts and excess inventory, highlighting adaptive AI's role in supply chain optimization.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies, effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning while maintaining scalability and plasticity.

Method: Introduces a modular neural network where modules selectively combine previous policies with internal ones, enabling linear parameter growth with task numbers.

Result: Outperforms alternatives in benchmark continuous control and visual tasks, showing better knowledge transfer and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively balances scalability, plasticity, and performance in continual reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

*Gyaneshwar Agrahari, Kiran Bist, Monika Pandey, Jacob Kapita, Zachary James, Jackson Knox, Steven Heymsfield, Sophia Ramirez, Peter Wolenski, Nadejda Drenska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model to predict body composition variables (ALM, BFP, BMD) using 3D optical images, offering an alternative to costly DXA scans. It outperforms supervised models in data-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and time constraints of DXA scans for measuring body composition variables, the study explores cheaper and faster alternatives using 3D optical images and machine learning.

Method: The study uses a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model on biomarkers from 3D optical images, comparing it with supervised models like SVR and Least Squares SVR.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model achieved errors of ~13% (ALM), ~10% (BMD), and ~20% (BFP) with 10% training data, while supervised models performed better (~8% for ALM/BMD, ~11% for BFP) with 80% data.

Conclusion: The $p$-Laplacian model is promising for healthcare in data-limited scenarios, offering a viable alternative to DXA scans.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases. Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc) obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However, most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM, $\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of $\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with $\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications, particularly in a data-constrained environment.

*Sunil Kumar, Bowen Zhao, Leo Dirac, Paulina Varshavskaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smaller VLMs trained with GRPO and tool use (e.g., zoom) outperform baselines in VQA tasks by leveraging detailed visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning under limited compute.

Method: Train smaller models with GRPO, simplified tool-calling, and a tailored data mix.

Result: Improved performance on VQA tasks compared to similarly-sized baselines.

Conclusion: Combining GRPO, tool use, and strategic training enhances VLM reasoning.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.

Result: DGP with ML-based prior outperforms others in capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty.

Conclusion: Advanced surrogate models like DGP enhance predictive accuracy, supporting robust and data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations. This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics. Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance SSD health prediction accuracy and stability for data reliability assurance, addressing the generalization bottleneck of traditional models.

Method: The model integrates BiGRU for bidirectional timing modeling and multi-head attention for dynamic feature weighting.

Result: Achieves 92.70% training and 92.44% test accuracy, with 0.94 AUC, demonstrating robust performance and generalization.

Conclusion: The model offers a practical solution for SSD preventive maintenance, reducing data loss risks and optimizing costs in cloud and edge storage.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%, demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud computing data centers and edge storage environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data is often incomplete or limited, hindering ML model performance. AMD diagnosis is critical, requiring models that integrate diverse factors and offer transparency.

Method: Developed CACTUS, a tool for AMD classification, focusing on explainability, flexibility, and identifying key factors while eliminating biased data.

Result: CACTUS outperforms standard ML models, enhances decision-making, and aligns with medical knowledge by highlighting important features.

Conclusion: CACTUS provides a reliable, transparent solution for AMD classification, aiding clinicians and addressing biases in healthcare data.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Motivation: Address small-scale one-class classification with limited negative samples, enhancing OC-SVM performance.

Method: Introduces GRKneg, improving OC-SVM kernel using negative data without label optimization, compared with standard OC-SVM and binary SVM.

Result: GRKneg outperforms standard OC-SVM with RBF kernel; with few negatives, it beats binary SVM.

Conclusion: GRKneg is effective for one-class classification with limited negative samples, offering better performance than standard methods.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms the binary SVM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an event-driven online Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) framework to address challenges like asynchronous data streaming and non-stationary environments, improving stability and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning in VFL faces challenges due to asynchronous data generation and non-intersecting feature sets among clients, which prior research overlooked.

Method: Developed an event-driven online VFL framework where only a subset of clients are activated per event, and introduced dynamic local regret (DLR) for non-convex models in non-stationary settings.

Result: The framework outperformed existing online VFL methods in stability, communication, and computation efficiency under non-stationary conditions.

Conclusion: The event-driven approach effectively addresses online VFL challenges, offering a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL, where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication and computation costs.

TL;DR: FedOne framework optimizes query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning by activating only one client per round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the neglected query cost in federated black-box prompt tuning for cloud-based LLMs.

Method: Proposed FedOne, a federated learning strategy activating one client per round, and conducted theoretical and numerical analysis.

Result: FedOne significantly improves query efficiency, aligning with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: FedOne is an effective solution for query-efficient federated black-box prompt learning.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne}, enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning algorithms to automatically define the separation threshold for anomaly detection in Autoencoders, addressing performance issues caused by nonstandardized thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders face challenges due to nonstandardized separation thresholds, which impact detection performance.

Method: Three machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, and Support Vector Machine) were evaluated for automatically defining the threshold.

Result: The evaluation of the three algorithms provides insights into their effectiveness for threshold definition.

Conclusion: Automating threshold definition with machine learning can improve the performance of anomaly detection in Autoencoders.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

TL;DR: The paper identifies and analyzes special channels in neural network loss landscapes where loss decreases slowly, neurons diverge to infinity, and input weights become equal, forming gated linear units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure and behavior of quasi-flat regions in neural network loss landscapes and their implications for optimization and model capabilities.

Method: The study characterizes these channels through gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation, examining their emergence in regression tasks.

Result: Gradient flow and related methods often reach these channels, which appear as flat minima but lead to gated linear units at convergence.

Conclusion: The findings reveal unexpected computational capabilities of fully connected layers and provide insights into the loss landscape's structure.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_iσ(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_jσ(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow σ(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) σ'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Motivation: To address the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals for diverse reasoning domains and expand the understanding of RL's applicability beyond math and code.

Method: Developed Guru, a corpus of 92K verifiable examples across six reasoning domains, with domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering. Evaluated RL training effects on models (Guru-7B and Guru-32B).

Result: Showed significant variation in RL benefits across domains, with in-domain training required for less pretrained domains. Guru models outperformed baselines by 7.9% and 6.7%.

Conclusion: RL facilitates genuine skill acquisition in less pretrained domains. Guru models achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving reasoning, especially on complex tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) to improve error estimation of ML models in unseen test domains by focusing on non-overlapping regions, outperforming prior DIS² methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate error estimation in unseen domains is critical for safe ML systems. Prior DIS² methods compete in overlapping regions, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Proposes ODD, which maximizes disagreement only in non-overlapping target domains using domain-classifiers to estimate overlap.

Result: ODD-based bounds outperform DIS² in predicting target performance, validated across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ODD provides a more reliable and accurate error estimation method for domain-shifted scenarios, with publicly available code and results.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD). Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of MS disability progression is difficult due to disease heterogeneity. The study aims to improve prediction accuracy by integrating clinical and digital data.

Method: Used state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models, a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods on baseline clinical and 12-week digital Floodlight data.

Result: Despite low early prediction accuracy (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data improved performance. A transformer with Moment FM embeddings performed best, and multimodal models consistently outperformed unimodal ones.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal approaches for extracting predictive signals from diverse clinical and digital data, aiding MS and other complex disease prognostics.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.

TL;DR: A multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework is proposed to balance fairness and performance, using strategic probing and submodular optimization for offline and online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fair decision-making under limited information in multi-agent systems while maximizing overall performance.

Method: Introduces a probing framework for gathering arm information, with a greedy algorithm for offline settings and a sublinear regret algorithm for online settings.

Result: Outperforms baselines in fairness and efficiency on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MA-MAB framework effectively balances fairness and performance in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

*Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that stable Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representations improve RL policies for sepsis treatment by addressing training instability and enforcing acuity-aware representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works overlooked training instability in sequential representations, which harms policy performance in RL for sepsis treatment.

Method: Uses CDE state representation with training stability (early stopping/stabilization) and acuity-aware regularization (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS).

Result: Stable CDE representations correlate with acuity scores and enable superior RL policies (WIS return > 0.9), while unstable ones fail (WIS return ~ 0).

Conclusion: Training stability and acuity-aware regularization are crucial for effective CDE-based representation learning in clinical RL.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim, Sumiran Singh Thakur, Su Min Park, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT-GO improves supervised fine-tuning by grouping tokens based on importance and optimizing with weighted loss, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT methods treat all tokens uniformly, ignoring critical task-specific information in subsets of tokens.

Method: SFT-GO groups tokens by importance, using a weighted combination of worst-group loss and cross-entropy loss for optimization.

Result: SFT-GO consistently outperforms baselines across benchmarks, datasets, and base models.

Conclusion: SFT-GO is robust and effective, enhancing learning dynamics by focusing on critical token groups.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

### [283] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou, Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of vocabulary size on training dynamics in large language models, revealing a new regime (Large Vocab) with different optimal scaling rules than $μP$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unrealistic assumption in $μP$ theory that input dimension (vocabulary size) is fixed, and to understand its effect on training dynamics.

Method: Theoretical analysis of vocabulary size's effect on training dynamics, followed by experiments including pretraining a 1B model.

Result: Training dynamics interpolate between $μP$ and a Large Vocab regime, with optimal embedding LR scaling as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$.

Conclusion: The study validates the new scaling rule for embedding LR, showing its practical benefit in pretraining large models.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $μ$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $μ$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \emph{interpolate between the $μ$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $μ$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $Θ(width)$ ratio predicted by $μ$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reinforcement learning methods for hyperparameter optimization are too costly, limiting widespread use.

Method: SPG extends the base model with temporary modules to generate state-action trajectories in a single forward pass.

Result: SPG improves model performance by +0.2~7% on diverse datasets (ImageNet, COCO, GLUE, SQuAD, SUPERB) with low computational costs.

Conclusion: SPG is a scalable and efficient alternative for hyperparameter optimization, validated across multiple domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3 multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$, with significantly low computational costs.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: A progressive framework (HiPreNets) improves neural network accuracy by learning residuals sequentially, addressing challenges in non-convex optimization and hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training highly accurate neural networks is difficult due to non-convex optimization and overlooked $L^{\infty}$ error, despite its importance in many applications.

Method: The framework refines staged training by sequentially learning prediction residuals with additional networks, optimizing loss functions, parameters, and adaptive data sampling.

Result: Validated through benchmark problems, the framework enhances overall accuracy.

Conclusion: HiPreNets effectively addresses training challenges and improves neural network precision.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify hallucinations in LLMs used as cognitive cores for embodied agents, especially under scene-task mismatches.

Method: Constructed a hallucination probing set from an existing benchmark, evaluated 12 models in two simulation environments.

Result: Models showed reasoning but failed to resolve inconsistencies, with hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations in handling infeasible tasks and provides actionable insights for improving model robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing traffic data due to sensor failures and sensing gaps hinders reliable traffic modeling, necessitating a robust imputation method.

Method: NCPF integrates CP decomposition into neural architecture via learnable embeddings and uses hierarchical feature fusion with Hadamard products and MLPs to model spatiotemporal interactions.

Result: NCPF outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines on six urban traffic datasets.

Conclusion: NCPF unifies interpretable CP decomposition with neural networks' nonlinear power, offering a flexible solution for traffic data imputation and supporting advanced transportation systems.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of unified taxonomy and systematic evaluation for verifying machine unlearning, driven by privacy, security, and legal compliance needs.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing verification into behavioral and parametric methods, analyzing assumptions, strengths, and limitations.

Result: Identifies gaps and vulnerabilities in current verification techniques, providing a structured overview.

Conclusion: Highlights open problems to guide future research toward robust and efficient unlearning verification.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance (e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category, analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

TL;DR: ImprovDML is a decentralized DML framework that balances high model accuracy, privacy preservation, and Byzantine resilience by using resilient vector consensus and Gaussian noise, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between Byzantine resilience, privacy, and model accuracy in distributed machine learning.

Method: Uses resilient vector consensus for aggregation and multivariate Gaussian noise for privacy, with convergence guarantees and error bounds.

Result: Achieves tighter learning error bounds and better privacy-accuracy trade-off than existing works.

Conclusion: ImprovDML effectively combines resilience, privacy, and accuracy, validated by simulations.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

*Yee Hin Chong, Peng Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoKA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method combining Kronecker-product factorization and SVD-driven initialization, reducing trainable parameters by 25% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of full fine-tuning and limitations of existing PEFT methods like latency, suboptimal convergence, or fixed rank choices.

Method: Uses Kronecker-product SVD (KPSVD) for compact weight updates and adaptive rank selection to prune negligible components.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance with 0.99M parameters (25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA) and shows faster convergence and stable gradients.

Conclusion: SoKA is a robust and efficient PEFT strategy for large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence (randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for large-scale model adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify animal behavior by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive assumptions, failing to reflect the dynamic recombination of motor primitives.

Method: SKIL leverages representation learning on transition probabilities to infer latent skill sets and parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. It is validated on grid worlds, labyrinths, and animal videos.

Result: SKIL identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond traditional discrete models.

Conclusion: SKIL provides a principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives, advancing behavior understanding.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between promising ML applications in science and the need for quantitative accuracy, the study focuses on evaluating ML methods for differential equations.

Method: The work quantifies accuracy by analyzing generalization bounds, training dynamics, and optimal parameters for white-box and black-box models, including deep linear models and neural networks.

Result: Generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed, and different models show opposing behaviors. Green's function representations are extracted from black-box models.

Conclusion: The study proposes a new cross-validation technique for evaluating generalization in physical systems, suggesting the Poisson equation as a benchmark for future methods.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate synthetic held-out data for Dataset Inference (DI), enabling detection of unauthorized training data use without requiring in-distribution private sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DI methods need in-distribution held-out data, which is rarely available, limiting their practicality.

Method: The approach involves generating synthetic data via a suffix-based completion task and calibrating it to bridge likelihood gaps with real data.

Result: Experiments show high-confidence detection of original training sets with low false positives.

Conclusion: The method reliably supports copyright claims and real-world litigations.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability for real-world litigations.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

TL;DR: DOVA-PATBM is a geo-computational framework for optimizing EV charging infrastructure, balancing urban, suburban, and rural needs with scalable, data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable infrastructure planning tools to address the diverse requirements of metropolitan, suburban, and rural areas for EV charging networks.

Method: Uses hierarchical H3 grid rasterization, GNN centrality models, Voronoi tessellation, and queue-based sizing with greedy heuristic site selection.

Result: In Georgia, DOVA-PATBM improved coverage by 12%, reduced low-income travel distance by half, and ensured power capacity, scalable nationally.

Conclusion: The framework bridges academic optimization and practical infrastructure policy, demonstrating effectiveness for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a credit risk management framework for 3PL-led SCF in CBEC, using QRGMM and DeepFM for risk assessment and loan size determination, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financing challenges for SMEs in CBEC due to limited credit histories, addressed by leveraging 3PL-led SCF with in-transit inventory as collateral.

Method: Combines Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) and Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM) for flexible risk estimation and loan size determination.

Result: Validated efficacy through synthetic and real-world data, offering improved credit risk assessment and SME access to capital.

Conclusion: Pioneering use of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, enhancing credit practices and SME financing opportunities.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

*Jinglong Luo, Zhuo Zhang, Yehong Zhang, Shiyu Liu, Ye Dong, Xun Zhou, Hui Wang, Yue Yu, Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SecFwT is a novel MPC-based framework for efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs, addressing computational overhead and inefficiency in MPC settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance is challenging due to data scarcity and privacy constraints. MPC-based methods are limited to inference, leaving fine-tuning computationally prohibitive.

Method: SecFwT introduces forward-only tuning to avoid backward/optimizer computations and uses MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to replace softmax attention, reducing non-linear operations.

Result: Experiments show SecFwT improves efficiency and privacy, enabling scalable, secure LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SecFwT successfully addresses key challenges in privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

*Yingcong Li, Xiangyu Chang, Muti Kara, Xiaofeng Liu, Amit Roy-Chowdhury, Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how in-context learning (ICL) works with missing or incorrect labels, showing that multilayer transformers outperform single-layer models by leveraging unlabeled data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why ICL works even with imperfect labels and to improve semi-supervised learning in tabular data.

Method: Theoretical analysis of binary Gaussian mixture models with missing labels, comparing one-layer linear attention models to multilayer/looped transformers.

Result: Multilayer transformers implicitly construct estimators that exploit unlabeled data, with performance improving exponentially with depth.

Conclusion: Looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models enhances semi-supervised learning, validated by real-world dataset evaluations.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

*Pavel Karpov, Ilya Petrenkov, Ruslan Raiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to predict abnormal values of unprescribed lab tests using performed test results, focusing on CBC and routine biochemical panels, achieving up to 8% AUC improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of abnormal lab values could enhance healthcare accessibility by leveraging existing test results.

Method: Formulates the problem as a set translation task, using GPT-like embeddings for labels and values, handling missing data without estimation.

Result: Achieves up to 8% AUC improvement for predicting high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges LLMs with tabular clinical data, improving diagnostic predictions without imputing missing values.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making. Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel knowledge distillation framework uses an off-the-shelf NNP teacher to generate training data, enabling stable MD simulations with fewer DFT calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods increase energy barriers, limiting high-energy structure inclusion in training data, which is critical for accurate MD simulations.

Method: A two-stage training process: first, train the student NNP with data from an off-the-shelf teacher; then fine-tune with a smaller DFT dataset.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties while reducing DFT calculations by 10x.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently generates NNPs for stable MD simulations with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.

*A. S. Stankevich, I. B. Petrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI2SB) framework to improve deep learning-based Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) by addressing limitations of diffusion models, such as iterative sampling and output control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models in FWI struggle with iterative sampling and heuristic output control, and lack clarity in integrating approximate velocity models. The paper aims to resolve these issues.

Method: The authors propose cI2SB, extending the Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I2SB) for conditional sampling, to interpolate between ground truth and smoothed velocity models.

Result: Experiments show cI2SB outperforms prior conditional diffusion models, achieving higher sample fidelity with fewer neural function evaluations (NFEs).

Conclusion: The cI2SB framework offers a more efficient and effective solution for FWI, validated by superior performance and code availability in the provided repository.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schrödinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge ($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluation for Explainable AI (XAI) methods by introducing a unified framework (VXAI) through a systematic literature review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of black-box AI models like Deep Neural Networks undermines trustworthiness, necessitating rigorous evaluation of XAI explanations.

Method: A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, analyzing 362 publications and categorizing metrics into 41 groups.

Result: Proposed a three-dimensional categorization scheme for XAI evaluation and introduced the VXAI framework for systematic metric selection.

Conclusion: The VXAI framework enhances comparability and flexibility in XAI evaluation, supporting future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection, promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for future extensions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve one-run DP auditing in black-box settings by using stronger membership inference attacks (MIA), achieving tighter bounds while remaining computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-run DP auditing methods in black-box settings show a gap between empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. The study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging stronger MIA techniques.

Method: The approach incorporates quantile regression for MIA to enhance one-run auditing in black-box settings, evaluated on DP-SGD-trained CIFAR-10 image classification models.

Result: The proposed method achieves tighter empirical lower bounds on privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating stronger MIA techniques like quantile regression improves one-run DP auditing in black-box settings, closing the gap between empirical and theoretical bounds.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically review and categorize reward modeling techniques in RL, addressing the gap in current literature.

Method: Categorizes reward modeling approaches by source, mechanism, and learning paradigm, and reviews evaluation methods.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of reward models, including established and emerging techniques.

Conclusion: Highlights promising research directions and fills the gap in systematic reviews of reward models in RL.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling. Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply DiTs to molecular conformer generation, overcoming challenges like combining discrete graph data with continuous 3D geometry and managing Euclidean symmetries.

Method: Proposes DiTMC, a modular framework with graph-based conditioning strategies and attention mechanisms (non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant).

Result: DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity on GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, and -XL benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiTMC demonstrates the impact of architectural choices and symmetry priors on sample quality, offering promising directions for large-scale molecular structure modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation of zero-shot RL methods in partially observable settings, common in real-world applications.

Method: Use memory-based architectures to handle partial observability in zero-shot RL, tested in environments with partially observed states, rewards, and dynamics.

Result: Memory-based methods show improved performance over memory-free baselines.

Conclusion: Memory-based architectures are effective for zero-shot RL in partially observable environments, with open-sourced code available.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show improved performance over memory-free baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for learning global ground metrics in optimal transport improves performance in tasks like embedding, clustering, and classification by leveraging class labels at the distribution level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional predefined or supervised ground metrics in optimal transport lack adaptability to data structure and feature importance, and often fail to generalize across classes or distributions with shared supports.

Method: Proposes a global ground metric learning approach that works for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space, using only class labels at the distribution level for training.

Result: The learned metric enhances optimal transport distances, improving performance in embedding, clustering, and classification, as demonstrated on scRNA-seq data across multiple diseases.

Conclusion: The method addresses limitations of existing approaches, offering a more adaptable and generalizable solution for optimal transport applications.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

*Laura Kopf, Nils Feldhus, Kirill Bykov, Philine Lou Bommer, Anna Hedström, Marina M. -C. Höhne, Oliver Eberle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a new framework for identifying and scoring polysemantic features in neural networks, improving feature description accuracy and capturing multiple concepts per neuron.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume neurons are monosemantic, limiting their ability to describe complex, polysemantic features, which are common in neural networks.

Method: PRISM provides nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features, benchmarking against existing methods.

Result: PRISM outperforms existing methods in description quality and polysemanticity scoring, demonstrating more accurate feature descriptions.

Conclusion: PRISM addresses limitations of current methods by better capturing the complexity of neural network features, enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

TL;DR: A novel technique simplifies warping paths to highlight key transformations (shift, compression, amplitude differences) in time series, improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack qualitative comparison and fail to show broader structural relationships, making it hard to understand shifts, speed changes, or slowdowns between time series.

Method: Proposes a technique to simplify warping paths, focusing on key transformations like shift, compression, and amplitude differences.

Result: Enhances interpretability by clearly representing how subsequences match between time series.

Conclusion: The method provides a clearer, more interpretable comparison of time series by highlighting key transformations.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generative models to explore novel designs without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification, addressing real-world decision-making challenges like scientific discovery.

Method: Introduces a framework for exploration as entropy maximization over a diffusion model's data manifold, using density estimation and a mirror descent algorithm for scalable fine-tuning.

Result: The method converges to an optimal exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions and shows promising empirical results on synthetic and high-dimensional tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages diffusion models for exploration, offering a scalable solution with theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating promising results.

*Gabrel J. Perin, Runjin Chen, Xuxi Chen, Nina S. T. Hirata, Zhangyang Wang, Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), a training-free method to enhance safety robustness in LLMs by addressing vulnerabilities in safety-critical subspaces during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite alignment efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable to safety breaches during fine-tuning, even with benign data. This paper aims to mitigate such risks.

Method: LoX extrapolates the safety subspace of an aligned LLM to improve robustness without additional training.

Result: LoX reduces attack success rates by 11% to 54% against benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks while maintaining task adaptability.

Conclusion: LoX effectively moves LLM parameters to a flatter, less perturbation-sensitive zone, enhancing safety robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

*Sepehr Elahi, Paula Mürmann, Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses minimizing disease extinction time in an SIS model with an unknown graph, proposing a graph-learning algorithm and vaccination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works assume known graphs, but real-world scenarios often lack this information, necessitating methods for unknown graphs.

Method: Splits the problem into graph learning (using an inclusion-exclusion-based algorithm) and vaccination (optimal and greedy algorithms).

Result: Proves sample complexity for graph recovery and polynomial-time solutions for bounded treewidth graphs. Validated with synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively learn graphs and optimize vaccination, offering practical solutions for unknown graph scenarios.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.

*Tevin Wang, Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule automates rule extraction from human feedback for RLHF, improving model performance and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rule-based reward methods in RLHF rely on manual engineering; AutoRule aims to automate this process.

Method: AutoRule uses a reasoning model to interpret preferences, extracts candidate rules, and synthesizes them into a unified set. It then verifies rule satisfaction using language models as an auxiliary reward.

Result: AutoRule improves win rates by 28.6% on AlpacaEval2.0 and 6.1% on MT-Bench, with reduced reward hacking.

Conclusion: AutoRule effectively automates rule extraction, enhancing RLHF performance and aligning with dataset preferences.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

### [316] [Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15448)
*Guoguo Ai, Hezhe Qiao, Hui Yan, Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHO introduces adaptive homophily learning for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods by capturing diverse homophily patterns in normal nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume uniform homophily in normal nodes, which fails in real-world datasets where homophily varies. RHO addresses this gap.

Method: RHO uses adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA) to learn and align homophily patterns from labeled normal nodes.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show RHO effectively captures varying homophily and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RHO robustly learns diverse homophily patterns, improving anomaly detection in graphs with limited labeled normal nodes.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

*Xiaoqing Sun, Alessandro Stolfo, Joshua Engels, Ben Wu, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Mrinmaya Sachan, Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates dense latents in sparse autoencoders (SAEs), showing they are meaningful and persistent, not just training artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role and origin of dense latents in SAEs, which are often dismissed as undesirable artifacts.

Method: Systematic analysis of dense latents' geometry, function, and origin, including ablation studies and a taxonomy of their types.

Result: Dense latents are intrinsic to the residual space, form antipodal pairs, and serve functional roles like position tracking and semantic representation.

Conclusion: Dense latents are meaningful and should not be dismissed as noise; they evolve functionally across model layers.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

TL;DR: A user-guided projection framework for image and text data leverages MLLMs for customizable, interpretable visualizations via natural-language prompts, enhancing cluster separation and interactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR techniques lack the ability to explore semantic structures not directly available in data dimensions or labels.

Method: Uses zero-shot classification with MLLMs, allowing users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language prompts.

Result: Improves cluster separation and transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between automated DR and human-centered exploration, offering flexible, tailored projections.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable, data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

TL;DR: The paper formalizes spatiotemporal over-squashing in STGNNs, showing its unique challenges and counterintuitive effects on information propagation, with implications for efficient design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored issue of over-squashing in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), where temporal dimensions amplify information propagation challenges.

Method: Formalizes the problem, analyzes its distinct characteristics, and evaluates convolutional STGNNs' information propagation patterns.

Result: Reveals that convolutional STGNNs favor distant temporal information over close-in-time data, affecting both time-and-space and time-then-space paradigms.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical and empirical validation, offering insights for more effective STGNN designs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

*Mohammadreza Nemati, Zhipeng Huang, Kevin S. Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIT-LVM improves prediction accuracy for high-dimensional interaction terms in linear predictors by using low-dimensional latent feature representations, outperforming elastic net and factorization machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear predictors with interaction terms can model non-linear relationships, but accurately estimating coefficients for high-dimensional interactions is challenging.

Method: LIT-LVM represents features with low-dimensional latent vectors, acting as structured regularization to reduce overfitting.

Result: LIT-LVM outperforms elastic net and factorization machines, especially with many interaction terms, and provides interpretable latent representations.

Conclusion: LIT-LVM is effective for high-dimensional interaction modeling, offering both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

TL;DR: RePCS is a lightweight, black-box method to detect if RAG systems rely on memorized data instead of retrieved context by comparing output distributions of parametric and retrieval-augmented paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs bypassing retrieved evidence and producing contaminated outputs in RAG systems.

Method: RePCS compares KL divergence between output distributions of parametric and retrieval-augmented paths to detect memorization.

Result: Achieves ROC-AUC of 0.918 on Prompt-WNQA, outperforming prior methods by 6.5 points with low latency overhead.

Conclusion: RePCS is a model-agnostic, efficient safeguard for verifying meaningful retrieval use in RAG systems, crucial for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplified analysis of SGD in linear regression using basic linear algebra, matching prior results without complex PSD matrix manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the analysis of SGD in linear regression more accessible and facilitate further improvements in training realistic models.

Method: Uses simple linear algebra tools to derive bias and variance bounds, avoiding complex operator manipulations on PSD matrices.

Result: Recovers the same bias and variance bounds as prior work, but with a simpler approach.

Conclusion: The simplified analysis enhances accessibility and may aid in advancing SGD techniques like mini-batching and learning rate scheduling.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools, bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the training of realistic models.

Result: Overcomes learning barriers for general recursive functions with new observations, connects learning computable functions to finite-state transducer inference, and shows negative results for linear-time computable functions.

Conclusion: The study provides a formal framework for learning computable functions under realistic constraints, revealing new insights and limitations in inductive inference.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in Wi-Fi fingerprinting due to device heterogeneity and temporal variations, leading to poor generalization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Uses a multi-level variational autoencoder for disentangling domain shifts and a memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism.

Result: Achieves up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DAILOC effectively addresses domain shifts and catastrophic forgetting, improving indoor localization accuracy.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time. Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Motivation: Understanding and addressing the degraded performance in scaling deep reinforcement learning networks.

Method: Empirical analyses to identify root causes (gradient pathologies and non-stationarity) and propose simple interventions to stabilize gradient flow.

Result: Simple, effective interventions enable robust performance across varying network scales, validated on multiple agents and environments.

Conclusion: The proposed interventions address scaling challenges in deep reinforcement learning, offering a practical solution compatible with existing algorithms.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of agents and suites of environments.

TL;DR: LogNet is a logic gate-based framework enhancing interpretability and performance of DL-based indoor localization, reducing errors and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL models for indoor localization lack interpretability, hindering understanding of temporal variations and long-term reliability.

Method: LogNet uses logic gates to identify influential APs and diagnose noise impact, improving transparency and adaptability.

Result: LogNet achieves lower localization error, smaller model size, and reduced latency compared to prior DL models.

Conclusion: LogNet provides interpretable and efficient indoor localization, addressing long-term reliability and performance issues.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more efficient and sustainable AI framework. We propose a compositional approach by ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence being more efficient.

*Modar Sulaiman, Kallol Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFLC, a method to correct biased and noisy labels in ML datasets while ensuring fairness, improving both performance and fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in ML is crucial as AI impacts society, but training data often contains biased labels, affecting model fairness and performance.

Method: GFLC combines prediction confidence, graph-based regularization (Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians), and demographic parity incentives to correct labels.

Result: Experiments show GFLC improves the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GFLC effectively addresses label bias and enhances fairness in ML models.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However, the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing. To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: MicroRicci is efficient, adaptive, and high-quality, making it ideal for real-time applications in graphics and simulation.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates, automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) is effective for BrainAGE estimation in stroke patients, outperforming single-site models and showing strong associations with vascular risk factors and functional outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in training robust BrainAGE models by evaluating FL's performance and its clinical relevance in stroke patients.

Method: Used FLAIR images from 1674 patients across 16 centers, comparing centralized learning, FL, and single-site learning. Examined associations with vascular risk factors and functional outcomes.

Result: FL outperformed single-site models; BrainAGE was higher in diabetic patients and significantly associated with post-stroke recovery.

Conclusion: FL enables accurate BrainAGE predictions without data centralization, highlighting its potential for stroke prognosis.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE reduces memory overhead in DP training by privatizing gradients after projection, using random Gaussian matrices, and applying projection during backpropagation, achieving comparable utility to DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead, limiting scalability in neural network training.

Method: DP-GRAPE introduces three modifications: privatizing gradients after projection, using random Gaussian matrices instead of SVD, and applying projection during backpropagation.

Result: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% for Vision Transformers and 70% for RoBERTa-Large, with similar performance to DP-Adam. It scales to models like OPT (6.7B parameters).

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE offers a memory-efficient DP training method without sacrificing accuracy or training time, making it scalable for large models.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.

TL;DR: The paper addresses over-conservatism in offline RL due to poor explorations in suboptimal data, proposing CAWR with robust loss functions and prioritized replay to improve policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the impact of poor explorations in offline RL, which leads to over-conservative policies in the AWR family.

Method: Introduces CAWR, combining robust loss functions for policy optimization and advantage-based prioritized experience replay to filter poor explorations.

Result: CAWR outperforms on the D4RL benchmark, learning superior policies from suboptimal data.

Conclusion: CAWR effectively reduces over-conservatism by addressing poor explorations, enhancing policy optimization performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues, such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption, specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance of policy optimization.

TL;DR: Proposes an informed corrector sampling scheme for discrete diffusion models to improve sample quality and efficiency, validated on text8 and ImageNet datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for discrete diffusion models struggle with balancing computation and sample quality when reducing sampling steps.

Method: Introduces a predictor-corrector sampling scheme with an informed corrector, hollow transformers, and a tailored training objective.

Result: Demonstrates superior sample quality with fewer errors and improved FID scores on text8 and ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: Informed correctors enhance fast and high-fidelity generation in discrete diffusion models.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling in discrete domains, yet efficiently sampling from these models remains challenging. Existing sampling strategies often struggle to balance computation and sample quality when the number of sampling steps is reduced, even when the model has learned the data distribution well. To address these limitations, we propose a predictor-corrector sampling scheme where the corrector is informed by the diffusion model to more reliably counter the accumulating approximation errors. To further enhance the effectiveness of our informed corrector, we introduce complementary architectural modifications based on hollow transformers and a simple tailored training objective that leverages more training signal. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the failure modes of existing samplers and show how informed correctors alleviate these problems. On the text8 and tokenized ImageNet 256x256 datasets, our informed corrector consistently produces superior samples with fewer errors or improved FID scores for discrete diffusion models. These results underscore the potential of informed correctors for fast and high-fidelity generation using discrete diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To summarize methodologies and findings in GAD studies, identify effective model designs, and address gaps in existing surveys.

Method: Systematic review of deep GAD methods from three perspectives: GNN backbone design, proxy task design, and graph anomaly measures. A taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories is proposed.

Result: Summarized widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparisons, providing insights into model designs and capabilities.

Conclusion: Identified open problems in GAD to inspire future research, with a repository for datasets, codes, and comparisons.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify unusual graph instances (nodes, edges, subgraphs, or graphs), has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its significance in a wide range of applications. Deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology, including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparison. We further discuss multiple open problems to inspire more future high-quality research.

*Qi Liu, Wanjing Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies the Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon (ESP), a sawtooth-shaped loss pattern in training with adaptive optimizers like Adam, caused by adaptive learning rate adjustments and data shuffling effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the recurring sawtooth loss pattern (ESP) observed during training with adaptive optimizers, particularly Adam, and analyze its underlying mechanisms.

Method: Empirical analysis of ESP, focusing on factors like Adam's parameters, batch size, data shuffling, and sample replacement, supported by a high-dimensional quadratic minimization task.

Result: ESP arises from adaptive learning rate adjustments and the "immediate re-exposure to samples" effect during shuffling. Smaller $β_2$ values exacerbate ESP but may regularize. Higher model capacity amplifies ESP.

Conclusion: ESP is a general phenomenon in adaptive optimization, not necessarily indicating overfitting, with implications for understanding optimizer behavior and training dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we identify and analyze a recurring training loss pattern, which we term the \textit{Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon (ESP)}, commonly observed during training with adaptive gradient-based optimizers, particularly Adam optimizer. This pattern is characterized by a sharp drop in loss at the beginning of each epoch, followed by a gradual increase, resulting in a sawtooth-shaped loss curve. Through empirical observations, we demonstrate that while this effect is most pronounced with Adam, it persists, although less severely, with other optimizers such as RMSProp. We empirically analyze the mechanisms underlying ESP, focusing on key factors such as Adam's $β$ parameters, batch size, data shuffling, and sample replacement. Our analysis shows that ESP arises from adaptive learning rate adjustments controlled by the second moment estimate. Additionally, we identify the ``immediate re-exposure to samples'' effect during data shuffling, which causes the model to learn or memorize more at the beginning of each epoch. We also find that smaller values of $β_2$ exacerbate ESP but can act as a form of regularization. While ESP is not necessarily indicative of overfitting, higher model capacity can amplify the phenomenon. To further support our analysis, we replicate ESP through a high-dimensional quadratic minimization task. We demonstrate that ESP can emerge even in simple optimization scenarios, reinforcing the generality of this pattern. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at https://github.com/qiliuchn/training-loss-pattern.

TL;DR: Proposes CS-DPMamba for MTS node classification, addressing long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity using contrast learning, FastDTW, DPMamba, and a GIN-enhanced network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in modeling long-range dependencies and obtaining dynamic similarities in high-dimensional MTS data.

Method: Uses temporal contrast learning for representations, FastDTW for similarity matrix, DPMamba for dependencies, and a GIN-enhanced network for classification.

Result: Achieves precise MTS node classification, outperforming on UEA datasets in supervised/semi-supervised tasks.

Conclusion: CS-DPMamba effectively addresses MTS challenges, demonstrating superior performance in classification tasks.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised method for MTS classification integrates heterogeneous relationships and shapelets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS classification methods struggle with high-dimensional data and lack of labeled data, leading to poor performance.

Method: Combines contrast temporal self-attention, soft dynamic time warping, and dual-level graph attention to build a heterogeneous graph for classification.

Result: Outperforms current methods on Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification, and University of East Anglia datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates additional information and improves semi-supervised MTS classification.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.

TL;DR: Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG) is studied theoretically, revealing how strong models can surpass weak supervisors using kernel-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how weak models can guide strong models, analogous to human-superhuman AI interaction, is crucial for future AI development.

Method: Theoretical analysis using kernels derived from weak and strong models' internal representations to define a learnable space.

Result: Strong models can correct weak supervision errors and surpass weak models, with empirical validation on molecular predictions and NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The theory provides a label-free metric for predicting W2SG performance, offering practical insights for AI supervision.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG), where a weak model supervises a stronger one, serves as an important analogy for understanding how humans might guide superhuman intelligence in the future. Promising empirical results revealed that a strong model can surpass its weak supervisor. While recent work has offered theoretical insights into this phenomenon, a clear understanding of the interactions between weak and strong models that drive W2SG remains elusive. We investigate W2SG through a theoretical lens and show that it can be characterized using kernels derived from the principal components of weak and strong models' internal representations. These kernels can be used to define a space that, at a high level, captures what the weak model is unable to learn but is learnable by the strong model. The projection of labels onto this space quantifies how much the strong model falls short of its full potential due to weak supervision. This characterization also provides insights into how certain errors in weak supervision can be corrected by the strong model, regardless of overfitting. Our theory has significant practical implications, providing a representation-based metric that predicts W2SG performance trends without requiring labels, as shown in experiments on molecular predictions with transformers and 5 NLP tasks involving 52 LLMs.

Result: Significantly enhances generalization to OOD tasks in MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments.

Conclusion: TAVT effectively captures task characteristics and mitigates overestimation errors, improving OOD task performance.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning aims to develop policies that generalize to unseen tasks sampled from a task distribution. While context-based meta-RL methods improve task representation using task latents, they often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To address this, we propose Task-Aware Virtual Training (TAVT), a novel algorithm that accurately captures task characteristics for both training and OOD scenarios using metric-based representation learning. Our method successfully preserves task characteristics in virtual tasks and employs a state regularization technique to mitigate overestimation errors in state-varying environments. Numerical results demonstrate that TAVT significantly enhances generalization to OOD tasks across various MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how LLMs may memorize personal data, making them subject to data protection laws like GDPR, and proposes ways for the ML community to address these legal implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the legal risks of LLMs memorizing personal data and the need for alignment between data protection laws and ML practices.

Method: The authors analyze LLM behavior, demonstrate their potential to contain personal data, and outline legal implications under GDPR.

Result: LLMs can be considered personal data, triggering GDPR requirements, and the ML community must address these legal challenges.

Conclusion: The paper calls for greater collaboration between legal and ML communities to ensure compliance with data protection laws throughout the ML lifecycle.

Abstract: Does GPT know you? The answer depends on your level of public recognition; however, if your information was available on a website, the answer could be yes. Most Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize training data to some extent. Thus, even when an LLM memorizes only a small amount of personal data, it typically falls within the scope of data protection laws. If a person is identified or identifiable, the implications are far-reaching. The LLM is subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements even after the training phase is concluded. To back our arguments: (1.) We reiterate that LLMs output training data at inference time, be it verbatim or in generalized form. (2.) We show that some LLMs can thus be considered personal data on their own. This triggers a cascade of data protection implications such as data subject rights, including rights to access, rectification, or erasure. These rights extend to the information embedded within the AI model. (3.) This paper argues that machine learning researchers must acknowledge the legal implications of LLMs as personal data throughout the full ML development lifecycle, from data collection and curation to model provision on e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face. (4.) We propose different ways for the ML research community to deal with these legal implications. Our paper serves as a starting point for improving the alignment between data protection law and the technical capabilities of LLMs. Our findings underscore the need for more interaction between the legal domain and the ML community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a virtual particle stochastic approximation method for gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space, simplifying convergence analysis and enabling efficient i.i.d. sampling without explicit propagation of chaos bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing finite-particle systems for gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is challenging due to dependent variables and complex convergence proofs. This work aims to simplify the analysis and improve efficiency.

Method: The proposed virtual particle stochastic approximation, inspired by Stein Variational Gradient Descent, acts as stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space. It avoids explicit propagation of chaos bounds.

Result: The algorithm converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to the infinite particle limit and produces i.i.d. samples efficiently.

Conclusion: The method simplifies convergence analysis and sampling in the 2-Wasserstein space, offering practical advantages over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation, originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ITE estimation in multiple treatments settings by leveraging KANs' unique learning capabilities.

Method: Uses two architectures: IPM for aligning ITE estimation and EB for covariate balancing via entropy optimization.

Result: KANITE achieves superior performance in $ε_{	ext{PEHE}}$ and $ε_{	ext{ATE}}$ metrics on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: KANITE demonstrates the potential of KANs to enhance causal inference methodologies.

Abstract: We introduce KANITE, a framework leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation under multiple treatments setting in causal inference. By utilizing KAN's unique abilities to learn univariate activation functions as opposed to learning linear weights by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we improve the estimates of ITEs. The KANITE framework comprises two key architectures: 1.Integral Probability Metric (IPM) architecture: This employs an IPM loss in a specialized manner to effectively align towards ITE estimation across multiple treatments. 2. Entropy Balancing (EB) architecture: This uses weights for samples that are learned by optimizing entropy subject to balancing the covariates across treatment groups. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KANITE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both $ε_{\text{PEHE}}$ and $ε_{\text{ATE}}$ metrics. Our experiments highlight the advantages of KANITE in achieving improved causal estimates, emphasizing the potential of KANs to advance causal inference methodologies across diverse application areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in reward hacking with reward-based methods and underperformance of preference-based methods in reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes TRPA, integrating rule-based and preference-based optimization with predefined rules and a novel RL training algorithm.

Result: TRPA achieves competitive performance and robust stability in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: TRPA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a stable and high-performing alternative.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability.

### [346] [Influential Bandits: Pulling an Arm May Change the Environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08200)
*Ryoma Sato, Shinji Ito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the influential bandit problem to model inter-arm interactions in non-stationary environments, proposing a new algorithm with near-optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bandit models fail to capture inter-arm influence, which is common in real-world applications.

Method: A new algorithm based on a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimator is introduced, tailored to the loss dynamics governed by an interaction matrix.

Result: The algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \log T)$, outperforming conventional methods in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The influential bandit problem addresses a critical gap in bandit literature, with practical implications for real-world applications.

Abstract: While classical formulations of multi-armed bandit problems assume that each arm's reward is independent and stationary, real-world applications often involve non-stationary environments and interdependencies between arms. In particular, selecting one arm may influence the future rewards of other arms, a scenario not adequately captured by existing models such as rotting bandits or restless bandits. To address this limitation, we propose the influential bandit problem, which models inter-arm interactions through an unknown, symmetric, positive semi-definite interaction matrix that governs the dynamics of arm losses. We formally define this problem and establish two regret lower bounds, including a superlinear $Ω(T^2 / \log^2 T)$ bound for the standard LCB algorithm (loss minimization version of UCB) and an algorithm-independent $Ω(T)$ bound, which highlight the inherent difficulty of the setting. We then introduce a new algorithm based on a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimator tailored to the structure of the loss dynamics. Under mild assumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \log T)$, which is nearly optimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon. The algorithm is simple to implement and computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the presence of inter-arm influence and confirm the superior performance of our method compared to conventional bandit algorithms.

### [347] [Position Paper: Rethinking Privacy in RL for Sequential Decision-making in the Age of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11511)
*Flint Xiaofeng Fan, Cheston Tan, Roger Wattenhofer, Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates for a new privacy paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL) to address shortcomings of traditional frameworks, proposing four core principles and calling for new theoretical and practical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional privacy frameworks are inadequate for RL systems due to their sequential, interactive, and context-dependent nature, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare and autonomous vehicles.

Method: The paper proposes a new privacy paradigm based on four principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation.

Result: The principles highlight tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability in RL systems, necessitating further research.

Conclusion: The paper urges the development of new frameworks, mechanisms, and evaluation methods to ensure effective privacy protection in RL systems.

Abstract: The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications demands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy frameworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential decision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics. Modern RL paradigms, such as federated RL (FedRL) and RL with human feedback (RLHF) in large language models (LLMs), exacerbate these challenges by introducing complex, interactive, and context-dependent learning environments that traditional methods do not address. In this position paper, we argue for a new privacy paradigm built on four core principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation. These principles expose inherent tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability that must be navigated as RL systems become more pervasive in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems powered by LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we call for the development of new theoretical frameworks, practical mechanisms, and rigorous evaluation methodologies that collectively enable effective privacy protection in sequential decision-making systems.

*Baohao Liao, Hanze Dong, Yuhui Xu, Doyen Sahoo, Christof Monz, Junnan Li, Caiming Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fractured Sampling improves LLM reasoning efficiency by interpolating between full Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and solution-only sampling, reducing token costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT methods incur high token costs, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive settings. Truncated CoT shows promise but lacks a unified approach.

Method: Introduces Fractured Sampling, which varies (1) reasoning trajectories, (2) solutions per trajectory, and (3) truncation depth to optimize accuracy-cost trade-offs.

Result: Demonstrates superior accuracy-cost trade-offs across benchmarks, with log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget.

Conclusion: Fractured Sampling offers a scalable, efficient strategy for LLM reasoning, with insights on optimal computation allocation.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRAG improves GCRL by enforcing uniform state coverage in latent spaces using adversarial neural weighting and Distributionally Robust Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited state coverage in GCRL due to over-representation of frequently visited states in latent spaces.

Method: Combines β-VAE with Distributionally Robust Optimization and adversarial neural weighting to ensure uniform state coverage.

Result: Enhanced state space coverage and better control performance in hard exploration tasks like mazes and robotic control.

Conclusion: DRAG effectively constructs meaningful latent spaces, improving GCRL performance without pre-training or prior knowledge.

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space, to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that combines the $β$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization. DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass, without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

Motivation: To address the limitation of LLM-based agents caused by prediction errors in chemistry tools by leveraging these agents to improve tool accuracy.

Method: Proposes ChemHAS, a hierarchical agent-stacking method that optimizes structures from limited data to enhance chemistry tools.

Result: ChemHAS achieves top performance in four chemistry tasks and identifies four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, improving interpretability.

Conclusion: ChemHAS effectively compensates for tool prediction errors and opens new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking), a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools. Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research.

*Joshua Barron, Devin White*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between memorization and generalization in LLMs, showing that model size influences whether a model excels at memorization or generalization, with no model succeeding at both when tasks are combined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between memorization and generalization in LLMs, as it remains an open research question with implications for model design.

Method: Pre-training capacity-limited Transformer models on synthetic tasks: one for generalization (arithmetic extrapolation) and one for memorization (factual recall).

Result: Small models generalize but fail to memorize; larger models memorize but fail to generalize. Intermediate models shift toward memorization. No model succeeds at both tasks when combined.

Conclusion: Pre-training may favor one learning mode over the other, and model capacity significantly impacts learning behavior, with implications for small language model design.

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization (via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size) succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the design and deployment of small language models.

TL;DR: A novel RL method mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks, outperforming existing rating-based RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF approaches simplify human reasoning by modeling isolated tasks, missing the complexity of human decision-making.

Method: Proposes a reward-free RL method using human ratings to infer a reward function, balancing classification and regression models with learnable weights.

Result: Outperforms existing rating-based RL methods and sometimes surpasses traditional RL approaches.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures human decision-making uncertainty and adapts to different strategies, showing superior performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key factor in aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional RL approaches.

*Yijun Lin, Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semi-supervised method for anomaly detection in network logs outperforms existing approaches by leveraging limited labeled data and unlabeled data to handle varying normal patterns and sparse anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume consistent normal behavior or require large labeled datasets, which are impractical due to varying network patterns and sparse anomalies.

Method: A novel semi-supervised approach captures dependencies in network time series to generate meaningful representations, learning separable embeddings for normal and abnormal samples.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in detecting abnormal events in real-world network logs.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised method effectively addresses the challenges of varying normal patterns and sparse anomalies, improving anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic). Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large real-world network log.

### [354] [PLD: A Choice-Theoretic List-Wise Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12542)
*Ejafa Bassam, Dawei Zhu, Kaigui Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a novel logit-based knowledge distillation method that optimizes a teacher-optimal ranking of classes, improving accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current logit-based knowledge distillation methods treat the distillation term as an add-on to cross-entropy, requiring careful tuning. The paper aims to unify this process by leveraging a choice-theoretic perspective.

Method: The authors recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model, interpreting teacher logits as 'worth' scores. PLD is introduced as a weighted list-wise ranking loss that transfers the teacher's full ranking of classes.

Result: PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by +0.42% over DIST and +1.04% over KD in homogeneous settings, and by +0.48% and +1.09% in heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: PLD provides a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy, offering a more effective and unified approach to knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST (arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in heterogeneous settings.

*Mark Huasong Meng, Guangdong Bai, Sin Gee Teo, Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a progressive, data-free pruning method for neural networks, using robustness metrics to guide pruning, outperforming one-shot approaches in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods assume access to original training data for fine-tuning, which is often impractical due to data privacy concerns. The study addresses pruning in a data-free context.

Method: A stochastic optimization-based pruning method replaces aggressive one-shot strategies with a progressive process, guided by robustness metrics.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms existing data-free pruning approaches in preserving robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed progressive pruning method is effective for data-free scenarios, balancing accuracy and robustness without requiring original training data.

Abstract: When deploying pre-trained neural network models in real-world applications, model consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile and smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process. Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAE and VGAE models had limitations hindering industrial adoption, prompting improvements for scalability, directed/dynamic graphs, and simplicity.

Method: Proposed strategies include graph degeneracy, stochastic subgraph decoding, Gravity-Inspired extensions for directed graphs, linear encoders for simplification, and Modularity-Aware models for community detection.

Result: Methods were evaluated on Deezer data, improving music recommendation, artist ranking in cold start, and modeling genre perception across cultures.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully enhances GAE and VGAE models for industrial applications, demonstrating effectiveness in music streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) emerged as two powerful groups of unsupervised node embedding methods, with various applications to graph-based machine learning problems such as link prediction and community detection. Nonetheless, at the beginning of this Ph.D. project, GAE and VGAE models were also suffering from key limitations, preventing them from being adopted in the industry. In this thesis, we present several contributions to improve these models, with the general aim of facilitating their use to address industrial-level problems involving graph representations. Firstly, we propose two strategies to overcome the scalability issues of previous GAE and VGAE models, permitting to effectively train these models on large graphs with millions of nodes and edges. These strategies leverage graph degeneracy and stochastic subgraph decoding techniques, respectively. Besides, we introduce Gravity-Inspired GAE and VGAE, providing the first extensions of these models for directed graphs, that are ubiquitous in industrial applications. We also consider extensions of GAE and VGAE models for dynamic graphs. Furthermore, we argue that GAE and VGAE models are often unnecessarily complex, and we propose to simplify them by leveraging linear encoders. Lastly, we introduce Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE to improve community detection on graphs, while jointly preserving good performances on link prediction. In the last part of this thesis, we evaluate our methods on several graphs extracted from the music streaming service Deezer. We put the emphasis on graph-based music recommendation problems. In particular, we show that our methods can improve the detection of communities of similar musical items to recommend to users, that they can effectively rank similar artists in a cold start setting, and that they permit modeling the music genre perception across cultures.

*Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti, Christian Kroer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses online decision-making under adversarial resource constraints, proposing primal-dual methods guided by a spending plan to achieve sublinear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to achieve sublinear regret when reward and cost distributions change adversarially. The paper aims to overcome this by leveraging a spending plan.

Method: The authors design primal-dual methods for two settings: online resource allocation and online learning with resource constraints, under full or bandit feedback.

Result: The algorithms achieve sublinear regret when the spending plan is balanced, with a robust variant for imbalanced plans. Performance degrades against benchmarks deviating from the plan.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles adversarial changes in reward and cost distributions, with performance tied to the quality of the spending plan.

Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to reliably identify or compare training algorithm improvements, hindering progress in deep learning efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a competitive benchmark (AlgoPerf) with fixed hardware and multiple workloads, addressing challenges like training completion, workload sensitivity, and hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Baseline submissions using various optimizers demonstrate the benchmark's feasibility, reveal performance gaps, and set a provisional state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The AlgoPerf benchmark provides a robust framework for evaluating training algorithms, enabling future improvements in training efficiency.

Abstract: Training algorithms, broadly construed, are an essential part of every deep learning pipeline. Training algorithm improvements that speed up training across a wide variety of workloads (e.g., better update rules, tuning protocols, learning rate schedules, or data selection schemes) could save time, save computational resources, and lead to better, more accurate, models. Unfortunately, as a community, we are currently unable to reliably identify training algorithm improvements, or even determine the state-of-the-art training algorithm. In this work, using concrete experiments, we argue that real progress in speeding up training requires new benchmarks that resolve three basic challenges faced by empirical comparisons of training algorithms: (1) how to decide when training is complete and precisely measure training time, (2) how to handle the sensitivity of measurements to exact workload details, and (3) how to fairly compare algorithms that require hyperparameter tuning. In order to address these challenges, we introduce a new, competitive, time-to-result benchmark using multiple workloads running on fixed hardware, the AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. Our benchmark includes a set of workload variants that make it possible to detect benchmark submissions that are more robust to workload changes than current widely-used methods. Finally, we evaluate baseline submissions constructed using various optimizers that represent current practice, as well as other optimizers that have recently received attention in the literature. These baseline results collectively demonstrate the feasibility of our benchmark, show that non-trivial gaps between methods exist, and set a provisional state-of-the-art for future benchmark submissions to try and surpass.

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating clinical decision support systems prioritizes calibration, robustness, and cost sensitivity, using an adjusted cross-entropy method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scoring rules like accuracy and AUC-ROC don't address clinical priorities such as calibration, robustness, and asymmetric error costs.

Method: Proposes an adjusted cross-entropy (log score) based on proper scoring rules, averaging cost-weighted performance over class balance ranges.

Result: The framework is simple, sensitive to clinical conditions, and prioritizes calibrated, robust models.

Conclusion: The method improves evaluation for clinical decision support by aligning with real-world priorities.

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules, such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

TL;DR: QTIP introduces trellis coded quantization (TCQ) for ultra-high-dimensional quantization in LLMs, improving both quantization quality and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector quantization (VQ) methods for PTQ are limited by low dimensions due to exponential codebook size, restricting quantization quality.

Method: QTIP uses TCQ with a stateful decoder, separating codebook size from bitrate and dimension, and introduces hardware-efficient trellis codes.

Result: QTIP achieves state-of-the-art results in quantization quality and inference speed.

Conclusion: TCQ-based QTIP overcomes VQ limitations, enabling high-dimensional quantization for better performance in LLM inference.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by quantizing weights to low-precision datatypes. Since LLM inference is usually memory-bound, PTQ methods can improve inference throughput. Recent state-of-the-art PTQ approaches use vector quantization (VQ) to quantize multiple weights at once, which improves information utilization through better shaping. However, VQ requires a codebook with size exponential in the dimension. This limits current VQ-based PTQ works to low VQ dimensions ($\le 8$) that in turn limit quantization quality. Here, we introduce QTIP, which instead uses trellis coded quantization (TCQ) to achieve ultra-high-dimensional quantization. TCQ uses a stateful decoder that separates the codebook size from the bitrate and effective dimension. QTIP introduces a spectrum of lookup-only to computed lookup-free trellis codes designed for a hardware-efficient "bitshift" trellis structure; these codes achieve state-of-the-art results in both quantization quality and inference speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOS (Model Surgery) addresses catastrophic forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning by using task-specific adapters and a self-refined retrieval mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting persists in CIL despite pre-trained models, due to parameter drift and retrieval mismatches.

Method: MOS employs task-specific adapters and a training-free self-refined retrieval mechanism to mitigate forgetting.

Result: MOS achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MOS effectively resists catastrophic forgetting by addressing parameter and retrieval-level issues.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DRL-based scheme to optimize gradient quantization in FL for VEC, balancing training time and quantization error under varying channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing per-round latency in FL for VEC while minimizing quantization error, especially under dynamic channel conditions.

Method: A distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based quantization level allocation scheme is introduced to optimize long-term rewards (training time and QE).

Result: Simulations identify optimal weight factors and validate the scheme's feasibility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-based scheme effectively optimizes FL performance in VEC by jointly managing training time and quantization error.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can protect the privacy of the vehicles in vehicle edge computing (VEC) to a certain extent through sharing the gradients of vehicles' local models instead of local data. The gradients of vehicles' local models are usually large for the vehicular artificial intelligence (AI) applications, thus transmitting such large gradients would cause large per-round latency. Gradient quantization has been proposed as one effective approach to reduce the per-round latency in FL enabled VEC through compressing gradients and reducing the number of bits, i.e., the quantization level, to transmit gradients. The selection of quantization level and thresholds determines the quantization error, which further affects the model accuracy and training time. To do so, the total training time and quantization error (QE) become two key metrics for the FL enabled VEC. It is critical to jointly optimize the total training time and QE for the FL enabled VEC. However, the time-varying channel condition causes more challenges to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based quantization level allocation scheme to optimize the long-term reward in terms of the total training time and QE. Extensive simulations identify the optimal weighted factors between the total training time and QE, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of real-time task offloading and resource allocation in vehicular edge computing.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for multiple applications on internet of vehicles. It requires vehicles to carry out multiple computing tasks in real time. However, due to the insufficient computing capability of vehicles themselves, offloading tasks to vehicular edge computing (VEC) servers and allocating computing resources to tasks becomes a challenge. In this paper, a multi task digital twin (DT) VEC network is established. By using DT to develop offloading strategies and resource allocation strategies for multiple tasks of each vehicle in a single slot, an optimization problem is constructed. To solve it, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method on the task offloading and resource allocation. Numerous experiments demonstrate that our method is effective compared to other benchmark algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication link deterioration in VEC due to obstacles by leveraging RIS for improved performance.

Result: Simulations show the proposed scheme outperforms centralized DDPG, TD3, and stochastic schemes.

Conclusion: RIS-assisted VEC with DRL enhances performance, offering a viable solution for IoV challenges.

Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme, we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user (VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model editing approach to improve generalization for low-resource languages and scripts, outperforming meta-learning in transfer learning and out-of-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of low-resource languages in recognition systems and enable robust performance across diverse domains.

Method: Leverages model editing techniques to incorporate unseen scripts, focusing on domain merging in sparse data distributions without reliance on meta-learning.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance boosts in transfer learning and out-of-domain evaluation, including historical ciphered texts and non-Latin scripts.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel approach for adopting underrepresented alphabets, enhancing document recognition for diverse contexts and cultures.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed, low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages, tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets, faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in \textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution energy time series data is essential but often restricted due to privacy, requiring synthetic alternatives. Existing methods struggle with high dimensionality and temporal dependencies.

Method: EnergyDiff uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models, with a specialized denoising network and Marginal Calibration technique, tailored for high-resolution time series.

Result: EnergyDiff outperforms baselines in capturing temporal dependencies and marginal distributions, especially at 1-minute resolution, and works across diverse energy domains and resolutions.

Conclusion: EnergyDiff is a universal, effective solution for generating synthetic energy time series data, validated across multiple domains and resolutions.

Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.

Conclusion: The survey offers deeper insights into continual learning for generative models, with a project page available for further exploration.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

TL;DR: OmniBioTE is a multi-omic transformer model trained on mixed protein and nucleic acid data, outperforming single-omic models in cross-modal tasks and structural predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-omic models lack cross-modal interaction capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bioinformatics. OmniBioTE addresses this by integrating multi-omic data.

Method: OmniBioTE is trained on 250 billion tokens of unlabeled protein and nucleic acid sequences, learning joint representations and structural insights without explicit training.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and identifies key protein residues in binding interactions. It also shows superior performance-per-FLOP.

Conclusion: OmniBioTE demonstrates the advantages of multi-omic training, enabling cross-modal understanding and efficient performance in bioinformatics tasks.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules. To date, most biosequence transformers have been trained on single-omic data-either proteins or nucleic acids and have seen incredible success in downstream tasks in each domain, with particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in protein structural modeling. However, single-omic pre-training limits the ability of these models to capture cross-modal interactions. Here we present OmniBioTE, the largest open-source multi-omic model trained on over 250 billion tokens of mixed protein and nucleic acid data. We show that despite only being trained on unlabeled sequence data, OmniBioTE learns joint representations mapping genes to their corresponding protein sequences. We further demonstrate that OmbiBioTE achieves state-of-the-art results predicting the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the binding interaction between a given nucleic acid and protein. Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers emergently learn useful structural information without any a priori structural training, allowing us to predict which protein residues are most involved in the protein-nucleic acid binding interaction. Lastly, compared to single-omic controls trained with identical compute, OmniBioTE demonstrates superior performance-per-FLOP across both multi-omic and single-omic benchmarks, highlighting the power of a unified modeling approach for biological sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting multiple distinct events' timing and their dependencies in survival analysis.

Method: MENSA combines traditional negative log-likelihood with a novel trajectory-based likelihood to learn shared feature representations and event dependencies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in risk and time-to-event prediction across various settings, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost.

Conclusion: MENSA is a scalable and efficient solution for multi-event survival analysis, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces.

Abstract: We introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning model for multi-event survival analysis, which predicts the time until an instance experiences multiple distinct events based on its features. MENSA learns a shared representation of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structures between events. In practice, it optimizes the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that MENSA improves risk and time-to-event prediction compared to state-of-the-art models across single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event settings. Moreover, MENSA achieves this with fewer parameters and lower computational cost (FLOPs) than several deep learning baselines, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces (more than 100 features).

*Ruiyang Hong, Anastasis Kratsios*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a structured class of ReLU MLPs that are both universal approximators and statistically reliable, achieving near-optimal sample complexity and preserving function regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between expressive models and statistically reliable ones in deep learning, the paper seeks a class of neural networks that is both universal and generalizable.

Method: The authors construct sparsely connected ReLU MLPs with specific width, depth, and weight constraints, using Kuhn triangulation to fit linear pieces perfectly.

Result: The MLPs approximate Hölder functions with uniform error, achieve near-optimal sample complexity, and preserve regularity for uniformly continuous functions.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that neural networks can balance expressivity and generalization, solving problems like the McShane extension on finite sets.

Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,α)$-Hölder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same Hölder exponent $α$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/α})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/α})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this by fitting together linear pieces perfectly via the Kuhn triangulation, and we introduce a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the Hölder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current med-MLLMs rely on large-scale data and autoregressive training, leading to weak vision-language alignment and high costs.

Method: Introduces EXGRA-MED, a multi-graph alignment framework for joint alignment of images, responses, and captions, with efficient black-box gradient estimation for scalable training.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to LLAVA-MED with 10% of data, gains 20.13% on VQA-RAD, and outperforms BIOMEDGPT and RADFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: EXGRA-MED offers efficient, high-quality vision-language integration for medical AI, reducing data dependency and improving performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art medical multi-modal LLMs (med-MLLMs), such as LLAVA-MED and BIOMEDGPT, primarily depend on scaling model size and data volume, with training driven largely by autoregressive objectives. However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce EXGRA-MED, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMa-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, EXGRA-MED matches LLAVA-MED's performance using just 10% of pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BIOMEDGPT and RADFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and instability of existing state-space models for long sequences, LinOSS draws inspiration from biological neural networks to propose a more robust solution.

Method: LinOSS is based on forced harmonic oscillators, discretized stably with parallel scans. It requires only nonnegative diagonal state matrices and is proven universal for continuous causal operators.

Result: LinOSS achieves stable, accurate long-horizon forecasting and outperforms SOTA models, notably Mamba and LRU, by nearly 2x on tasks with sequences of length 50k.

Conclusion: LinOSS offers a stable, efficient, and universal framework for modeling long sequences, demonstrating superior performance across diverse time-series tasks.

Abstract: We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.

Conclusion: LoSAM advances causal inference by addressing limitations of existing ANM methods, providing a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observational data is crucial when experiments are costly or infeasible. Additive noise models (ANMs) enable unique directed acyclic graph (DAG) identification, but existing sample-efficient ANM methods often rely on restrictive assumptions on the data generating process, limiting their applicability to real-world settings. We propose local search in additive noise models, LoSAM, a topological ordering method for learning a unique DAG in ANMs with mixed causal mechanisms and general noise distributions. We introduce new causal substructures and criteria for identifying roots and leaves, enabling efficient top-down learning. We prove asymptotic consistency and polynomial runtime, ensuring scalability and sample efficiency. We test LoSAM on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across all mixed mechanism settings.

Motivation: Accurate forecasts help government agencies prepare and distribute resources for opioid overdoses.

Method: Used county/district-level EMS data and tested models of varying complexity with additional covariates.

Conclusion: High-performance forecasting is possible with accessible data and straightforward models.

Abstract: We present efforts in the fields of machine learning and time series forecasting to accurately predict counts of future suspected opioid overdoses recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the state of Kentucky. Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DRL-based method to optimize energy consumption and AoI in C-V2X vehicular communication, addressing resource collisions and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve communication latency and collision issues in C-V2X systems, especially with SPS protocol limitations, and to balance reliability, delay, and energy consumption.

Method: Analyzes multi-priority queues and NOMA's impact on AoI, then introduces a DRL-based optimization method for energy and AoI.

Result: Comparative simulations show the proposed DRL method outperforms baseline methods in energy consumption and AoI.

Conclusion: DRL effectively optimizes C-V2X communication by reducing energy use and improving AoI, offering a viable solution for dynamic vehicular networks.

Abstract: To address communication latency issues, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined Cellular-Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) technology, which includes Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication for direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication. However, this method requires vehicles to autonomously select communication resources based on the Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) protocol, which may lead to collisions due to different vehicles sharing the same communication resources, thereby affecting communication effectiveness. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is considered a potential solution for handling large-scale vehicle communication, as it can enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) by employing Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), thereby reducing the negative impact of communication collisions. When evaluating vehicle communication performance, traditional metrics such as reliability and transmission delay present certain contradictions. Introducing the new metric Age of Information (AoI) provides a more comprehensive evaluation of communication system. Additionally, to ensure service quality, user terminals need to possess high computational capabilities, which may lead to increased energy consumption, necessitating a trade-off between communication energy consumption and effectiveness. Given the complexity and dynamics of communication systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) serves as an intelligent learning method capable of learning optimal strategies in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effects of multi-priority queues and NOMA on AoI in the C-V2X vehicular communication system and proposes an energy consumption and AoI optimization method based on DRL. Finally, through comparative simulations with baseline methods, the proposed approach demonstrates its advances in terms of energy consumption and AoI.

Result: Achieves 2x speed and 6x memory efficiency, with models ranging from 3.6M to 85M parameters, setting new benchmarks in EEG tasks.

Conclusion: CEReBrO is effective and efficient, validated by performance in emotion detection, seizure detection, and other EEG tasks.

Abstract: Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a crucial tool for studying brain activity. Recently, self-supervised learning methods leveraging large unlabeled datasets have emerged as a potential solution to the scarcity of widely available annotated EEG data. However, current methods suffer from at least one of the following limitations: i) sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, ii) model sizes in the hundreds of millions of trainable parameters, and iii) reliance on private datasets and/or inconsistent public benchmarks, hindering reproducibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a Compact Encoder for Representations of Brain Oscillations using alternating attention (CEReBrO), a new small EEG foundation model. Our tokenization scheme represents EEG signals at a per-channel patch granularity. We propose an alternating attention mechanism that jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial correlations, achieving 2x speed improvement with 6x less memory required compared to standard self-attention. We present several model sizes ranging from 3.6 million to 85 million parameters. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of publicly available scalp EEG recordings with diverse channel configurations, our models set new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks, with competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction. This validates our models' effectiveness and efficiency.

Result: Significant accuracy improvement on 10 datasets with 3 GNNs, plus deeper, more robust models against poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: Personalized layer selection enhances GNN adaptability, inspiring future work on adaptive graph representations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine node attributes over a fixed granularity of the local graph structure around a node to predict its label. However, different nodes may relate to a node-level property with a different granularity of its local neighborhood, and using the same level of smoothing for all nodes can be detrimental to their classification. In this work, we challenge the common fact that a single GNN layer can classify all nodes of a graph by training GNNs with a distinct personalized layer for each node. Inspired by metric learning, we propose a novel algorithm, MetSelect1, to select the optimal representation layer to classify each node. In particular, we identify a prototype representation of each class in a transformed GNN layer and then, classify using the layer where the distance is smallest to a class prototype after normalizing with that layer's variance. Results on 10 datasets and 3 different GNNs show that we significantly improve the node classification accuracy of GNNs in a plug-and-play manner. We also find that using variable layers for prediction enables GNNs to be deeper and more robust to poisoning attacks. We hope this work can inspire future works to learn more adaptive and personalized graph representations.

*Grigoriy Ksenofontov, Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for solving the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) problem in discrete spaces, proposing the Categorical Schrödinger Bridge Matching (CSBM) method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SB research primarily addresses continuous data, leaving gaps in theory and algorithms for discrete data (e.g., VQ representations, text tokens). This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The paper leverages the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, specifically discrete-time IMF (D-IMF), to theoretically justify convergence to SB in discrete spaces. It then develops the CSBM algorithm.

Result: CSBM is validated through experiments on synthetic data and VQ representations of images, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical solution for SB in discrete spaces, with potential applications in generative modeling tasks like domain translation.

Abstract: The Schrödinger Bridge (SB) is a powerful framework for solving generative modeling tasks such as unpaired domain translation. Most SB-related research focuses on continuous data space $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and leaves open theoretical and algorithmic questions about applying SB methods to discrete data, e.g, on finite spaces $\mathbb{S}^{D}$. Notable examples of such sets $\mathbb{S}$ are codebooks of vector-quantized (VQ) representations of modern autoencoders, tokens in texts, categories of atoms in molecules, etc. In this paper, we provide a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for solving SB in discrete spaces using the recently introduced Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure. Specifically, we theoretically justify the convergence of discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) to SB in discrete spaces. This enables us to develop a practical computational algorithm for SB, which we call Categorical Schrödinger Bridge Matching (CSBM). We show the performance of CSBM via a series of experiments with synthetic data and VQ representations of images. The code of CSBM is available at https://github.com/gregkseno/csbm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical foundations of zero-initialized attention in LLaMA-Adapter, which lacks rigorous analysis despite empirical success.

Method: Theoretical analysis connecting zero-initialized attention to mixture-of-expert models, with empirical validation on open LLM benchmarks.

Result: Non-linear prompts outperform linear ones, and both surpass vanilla attention, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: Zero-initialized attention is robust and adaptable, with non-linear prompts offering greater flexibility for future applications.

Abstract: The LLaMA-Adapter has recently emerged as an efficient fine-tuning technique for LLaMA models, leveraging zero-initialized attention to stabilize training and enhance performance. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of zero-initialized attention remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing a connection between zero-initialized attention and mixture-of-expert models. We prove that both linear and non-linear prompts, along with gating functions, can be optimally estimated, with non-linear prompts offering greater flexibility for future applications. Empirically, we validate our findings on the open LLM benchmarks, demonstrating that non-linear prompts outperform linear ones. Notably, even with limited training data, both prompt types consistently surpass vanilla attention, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of zero-initialized attention.

*Ruihan Wu, Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves the upper bound for stochastic decision-theoretic online learning under differential privacy and introduces a deterministic setting to analyze the gap between bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open problem of determining the optimal instance-dependent rate for stochastic decision-theoretic online learning under differential privacy.

Method: The authors provide an improved upper bound and introduce a deterministic setting to analyze the gap, using novel analysis techniques.

Result: An improved upper bound of $O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log^2K}{\varepsilon}\right)$ and matching bounds of $\Theta(\frac{\log K}{\varepsilon})$ in the deterministic setting.

Conclusion: The work partially resolves the open problem by improving the upper bound and providing insights through the deterministic setting.

Abstract: Hu and Mehta (2024) posed an open problem: what is the optimal instance-dependent rate for the stochastic decision-theoretic online learning (with $K$ actions and $T$ rounds) under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy? Before, the best known upper bound and lower bound are $O\left(\frac{\log K}{Δ_{\min}} + \frac{\log K\log T}{\varepsilon}\right)$ and $Ω\left(\frac{\log K}{Δ_{\min}} + \frac{\log K}{\varepsilon}\right)$ (where $Δ_{\min}$ is the gap between the optimal and the second actions). In this paper, we partially address this open problem by having two new results. First, we provide an improved upper bound for this problem $O\left(\frac{\log K}{Δ_{\min}} + \frac{\log^2K}{\varepsilon}\right)$, which is $T$-independent and only has a log dependency in $K$. Second, to further understand the gap, we introduce the \textit{deterministic setting}, a weaker setting of this open problem, where the received loss vector is deterministic. At this weaker setting, a direct application of the analysis and algorithms from the original setting still leads to an extra log factor. We conduct a novel analysis which proves upper and lower bounds that match at $Θ(\frac{\log K}{\varepsilon})$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by alternating learning dynamics in two-player games, a recent work by Cevher et al.(2024) shows that $o(\sqrt{T})$ alternating regret is possible for any $T$-round adversarial Online Linear Optimization (OLO) problem, and left as an open question whether the same is true for general Online Convex Optimization (OCO). We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the continuous Hedge algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ alternating regret for any adversarial $d$-dimensional OCO problems. We show that this implies an alternating learning dynamic that finds a Nash equilibrium for any convex-concave zero-sum games or a coarse correlated equilibrium for any convex two-player general-sum games at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}/T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. To further improve the time complexity and/or the dimension dependence, we propose another simple algorithm, Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with a regularizer whose convex conjugate is 3rd-order smooth, for OCO with smooth and self-concordant loss functions (such as linear or quadratic losses). We instantiate our algorithm with different regularizers and show that, for example, when the decision set is the $\ell_2$ ball, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{5}})$ alternating regret with no dimension dependence (and a better $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ bound for quadratic losses). We complement our results by showing some algorithm-specific alternating regret lower bounds, including a somewhat surprising $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for a Regret Matching variant that is widely used in alternating learning dynamics.

### [383] [Bandit and Delayed Feedback in Online Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18709)
*Yuki Shibukawa, Taira Tsuchiya, Shinsaku Sakaue, Kenji Yamanishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes algorithms for online structured prediction with bandit and delayed feedback, achieving surrogate regret bounds independent of output set size and comparing their performance numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-information feedback is often impractical for complex outputs, prompting the need for algorithms that work with less demanding feedback like bandit and delayed feedback.

Method: The authors introduce two algorithms: one using an inverse-weighted gradient estimator for bandit feedback (regret bound $O(\sqrt{KT})$) and another with a pseudo-inverse matrix estimator (regret bound $O(T^{2/3})$). They also address delayed feedback scenarios.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve surrogate regret bounds independent of the output set size $K$ and perform competitively in numerical comparisons.

Conclusion: The work advances online structured prediction by addressing practical feedback limitations, offering efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Online structured prediction is a task of sequentially predicting outputs with complex structures based on inputs and past observations, encompassing online classification. Recent studies showed that in the full-information setting, we can achieve finite bounds on the \textit{surrogate regret}, i.e. the extra target loss relative to the best possible surrogate loss. In practice, however, full-information feedback is often unrealistic as it requires immediate access to the whole structure of complex outputs. Motivated by this, we propose algorithms that work with less demanding feedback, bandit and delayed feedback. For bandit feedback, by using a standard inverse-weighted gradient estimator, we achieve a surrogate regret bound of $O(\sqrt{KT})$ for the time horizon $T$ and the size of the output set $K$. However, $K$ can be extremely large when outputs are highly complex, resulting in an undesirable bound. To address this issue, we propose another algorithm that achieves a surrogate regret bound of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is independent of $K$. This is achieved with a carefully designed pseudo-inverse matrix estimator. Furthermore, we numerically compare the performance of these algorithms, as well as existing ones. Regarding delayed feedback, we provide algorithms and regret analyses that cover various scenarios, including full-information and bandit feedback, as well as fixed and variable delays.

### [384] [Data Distributional Properties As Inductive Bias for Systematic Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20499)
*Felipe del Rio, Alain Raymond-Saez, Daniel Florea, Rodrigo Toro Icarte, Julio Hurtado, Cristian B. Calderon, Alvaro Soto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how data distribution properties (diversity, burstiness, latent intervention) enhance systematic generalization (SG) in deep neural networks, finding significant improvements and linking lower Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to better SG via parallel neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with systematic generalization, and while prior work focused on architectures or training methods, this study investigates how training data properties can improve SG.

Method: The study examines three data properties: diversity (increased latent property values), burstiness (restricted latent values per input), and latent intervention (randomly altering latent factors). Experiments test their impact on SG.

Result: All three properties significantly boost SG, with diversity showing an 89% accuracy increase. Lower NMI between latent attributes predicts better out-of-distribution generalization, linked to more parallel neural representations.

Conclusion: Data distribution properties are crucial for SG, with NMI serving as a predictor. Parallel neural representations, induced by lower NMI, enhance reasoning by analogy, improving generalization.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle at systematic generalization (SG). Several studies have evaluated the possibility to promote SG through the proposal of novel architectures, loss functions or training methodologies. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of training data properties in promoting SG. In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data distributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a multi-modal language model. To this end, we study three different properties. First, data diversity, instantiated as an increase in the possible values a latent property in the training distribution may take. Second, burstiness, where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent factors on particular inputs during training. Third, latent intervention, where a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that all three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89% absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series of experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties promote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the capacity of reasoning by analogy.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study safe linear bandits (SLBs), where an agent selects actions from a convex set to maximize an unknown linear objective subject to unknown linear constraints in each round. Existing methods for SLBs provide strong regret guarantees, but require solving expensive optimization problems (e.g., second-order cones, NP hard programs). To address this, we propose Constrained Linear Thompson Sampling (COLTS), a sampling-based framework that selects actions by solving perturbed linear programs, which significantly reduces computational costs while matching the regret and risk of prior methods. We develop two main variants: S-COLTS, which ensures zero risk and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ regret given a safe action, and R-COLTS, which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ regret and risk with no instance information. In simulations, these methods match or outperform state of the art SLB approaches while substantially improving scalability. On the technical front, we introduce a novel coupled noise design that ensures frequent `local optimism' about the true optimum, and a scaling-based analysis to handle the per-round variability of constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAD-MAX is a novel automated red teaming method for LLMs, outperforming TAP in attack success rate and efficiency by using modular, diverse attack strategies and similarity filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of LLM usage and their vulnerability to jailbreaks necessitates cost-efficient, high-success-rate, and extensible red teaming methods.

Method: MAD-MAX automates attack strategy assignment into clusters, selects relevant clusters for malicious goals, combines strategies for diverse attacks, and prunes similar ones for efficiency.

Result: MAD-MAX achieves a 97% jailbreak success rate on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro, outperforming TAP (66%), with fewer queries (10.9 vs. 23.3).

Conclusion: MAD-MAX is a scalable, efficient solution for continuous LLM security testing, adaptable to new attack strategies.

Abstract: With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3.

TL;DR: A framework for efficiently learning PDFs and CDFs of sub-Weibull distributions from streaming samples, enabling sublinear space usage and improved distance estimation (Wasserstein, TV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of resource-efficiently computing probability distributions and their distances from streaming samples, a fundamental problem in mathematical sciences.

Method: Reduce PDF/CDF estimation to frequency estimation of discretized subsets, enabling mergeable summaries with sublinear space. Extends to continuous distributions with infinite support.

Result: Algorithms improve on existing methods (super-linear time, linear space) and match lower bounds for discrete distributions. Useful for auditing fairness and privacy.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is efficient, tight with existing bounds, and empirically validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Resource-efficiently computing representations of probability distributions and the distances between them while only having access to the samples is a fundamental and useful problem across mathematical sciences. In this paper, we propose a generic framework to learn the probability and cumulative distribution functions (PDFs and CDFs) of a sub-Weibull, i.e. almost any light- or heavy-tailed, distribution while the samples from it arrive in a stream. The idea is to reduce these problems into estimating the frequency of an \textit{appropriately chosen subset} of the support of a \textit{properly discretised distribution}. We leverage this reduction to compute mergeable summaries of distributions from the stream of samples while requiring only sublinear space relative to the number of observed samples. This allows us to estimate Wasserstein and Total Variation (TV) distances between any two distributions while samples arrive in streams and from multiple sources. Our algorithms significantly improves on the existing methods for distance estimation incurring super-linear time and linear space complexities, and further extend the mergeable summaries framework to continuous distributions with possibly infinite support. Our results are tight with respect to the existing lower bounds for bounded discrete distributions. In addition, we leverage our proposed estimators of Wasserstein and TV distances to tightly audit the fairness and privacy of algorithms. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency of proposed algorithms across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently control swarms of identical, interacting agents by solving the MFSB problem without relying on learning-based or discretized methods.

Method: A parameterization using Gaussian Mixture Models and Covariance Steering, decomposing the problem into Gaussian-to-Gaussian policies solved via semidefinite programming.

Result: The method provides a closed-form, numerically tractable solution for MFSB, handling probabilistic constraints effectively.

Conclusion: The approach is efficient and scalable, demonstrated through numerical examples, offering a practical alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: The Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem is an optimization problem aiming to find the minimum effort control policy to drive a McKean-Vlassov stochastic differential equation from one probability measure to another. In the context of multi-agent control, the objective is to control the configuration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as captured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available methods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely either on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating optimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization schemes. For agents following Linear Time Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian Mixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient parameterization to approximate the optimal solutions of the corresponding MFSB in closed form, without any learning step. Our proposed approach consists of a mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance Steering problem from the components of the initial mixture to the components of the terminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the Covariance Steering problem, the proposed solver can handle probabilistic constraints on the system's state while maintaining numerical tractability. We illustrate our approach on a variety of numerical examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reflection evaluation is time-consuming and lacks scalability, prompting the need for automated solutions using LLMs.

Method: Employed LLMs with single-agent/multi-agent strategies and zero-shot/few-shot prompting to assess reflections quantitatively.

Result: Single-agent with few-shot strategy matched human evaluations best; LLM-assessed scores improved at-risk student identification and grade prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs can automate reflection assessment, reduce educator workload, and support timely student interventions, enhancing educational outcomes.

Abstract: We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance. Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.

*Guangtao Zheng, Wenqian Ye, Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShortcutProbe is a post hoc framework for mitigating spurious bias in deep learning models without needing group labels, improving robustness by identifying and addressing prediction shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on spurious correlations, degrading performance on data lacking these correlations. Existing methods require costly group labels, which may miss subtle biases.

Method: ShortcutProbe identifies prediction shortcuts in a model's latent space and retrains the model to be invariant to these shortcuts.

Result: The framework theoretically and empirically improves model robustness to spurious bias across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: ShortcutProbe offers an efficient, practical solution for spurious bias mitigation without group labels.

Abstract: Deep learning models often achieve high performance by inadvertently learning spurious correlations between targets and non-essential features. For example, an image classifier may identify an object via its background that spuriously correlates with it. This prediction behavior, known as spurious bias, severely degrades model performance on data that lacks the learned spurious correlations. Existing methods on spurious bias mitigation typically require a variety of data groups with spurious correlation annotations called group labels. However, group labels require costly human annotations and often fail to capture subtle spurious biases such as relying on specific pixels for predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc spurious bias mitigation framework without requiring group labels. Our framework, termed ShortcutProbe, identifies prediction shortcuts that reflect potential non-robustness in predictions in a given model's latent space. The model is then retrained to be invariant to the identified prediction shortcuts for improved robustness. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the framework and empirically demonstrate that it is an efficient and practical tool for improving a model's robustness to spurious bias on diverse datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach, UrbanX, to automate hypothesis generation and refinement for urban and transportation research, addressing challenges like human bias and limited interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional urban research workflows are slow, biased, and underutilize unstructured data. The goal is to automate and improve interpretability in hypothesis testing for road safety and urban outcomes.

Method: UrbanX uses MLLMs to generate safety-related questions for street view images, extracts interpretable embeddings, and applies regression models for hypothesis testing.

Result: Tests on Manhattan streets show UrbanX outperforms deep learning models while remaining interpretable.

Conclusion: UrbanX offers a scalable, interpretable framework for urban research, applicable beyond road safety to diverse urban outcomes.

Abstract: Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning, development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However, traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference, enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.

TL;DR: DC-Clustering is a federated clustering method for complex data splits, preserving privacy and matching centralized performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated clustering methods are limited to simple data splits, failing to address complex distributed structures.

Method: Proposes DC-Clustering, where institutions share intermediate representations, allowing flexible k-means or spectral clustering with one communication round.

Result: Experiments show DC-Clustering matches centralized clustering performance on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills a gap in FL by enabling effective clustering of heterogeneous data, with privacy, efficiency, and flexibility.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering), a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled. DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism for wireless federated learning (WFL) that leverages communication noises and avoids catastrophic bit errors by transmitting only fraction bits of model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing digital communication systems using floating-point standards (e.g., IEEE 754) overlook the potential of communication noises for privacy preservation due to risks like catastrophic bit errors.

Method: A novel channel-native bit-flipping DP mechanism is proposed, where bits are randomly flipped, and a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method transmits only fraction bits, avoiding sign and exponent bits.

Result: The mechanism satisfies (λ,ε)-Rényi DP, preserves WFL convergence, and outperforms Gaussian mechanisms in privacy and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages communication noises for privacy in WFL while avoiding catastrophic errors, demonstrating superior privacy and convergence compared to Gaussian mechanisms.

Abstract: Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards, e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers, e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies (λ,ε)-Rényi DP and does not violate the WFL convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for privacy protection.

### [394] [Fast Convergence for High-Order ODE Solvers in Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13061)
*Daniel Zhengyu Huang, Jiaoyang Huang, Zhengjiang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs, focusing on high-order Runge-Kutta schemes. It provides theoretical bounds on sampling accuracy under bounded score function derivatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interaction between score function regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error in diffusion probabilistic models, ensuring accurate sampling.

Method: Develops p-th order Runge-Kutta schemes for probability flow ODEs, assuming bounded first and second derivatives of the approximate score function.

Result: The total variation distance between target and generated distributions is bounded, with numerical verification supporting the bounded derivatives assumption.

Conclusion: The theoretical guarantees apply to general forward processes, confirming practical feasibility of high-order schemes for efficient sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver. We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets, confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.

*Yi Wang, Zhenghong Wang, Fan Zhang, Chengling Tang, Chaogui Kang, Di Zhu, Zhongfu Ma, Sijie Ruan, Weiyu Zhang, Yu Zheng, Philip S. Yu, Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Gravityformer, a physics-informed deep learning framework for human activity intensity prediction, integrating the law of gravitation to address spatial constraints and over-smoothing in ST-GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ST-GNNs ignore physical constraints of spatial interactions and over-smoothing in spatial correlation modeling, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Gravityformer refines transformer attention using the law of gravitation, estimates mass parameters from inflow/outflow, models cross-unit interaction likelihood, and mitigates over-smoothing. It also introduces a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer.

Result: Experiments on six datasets show Gravityformer outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, with interpretable gravity attention matrices.

Conclusion: The work successfully integrates physical laws with deep learning, offering a novel approach for spatiotemporal predictive learning.

Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal predictive learning.

*Tatthapong Srikitrungruang, Matthew Lemon, Sina Aghaee Dabaghan Fard, Jaesung Lee, Yuxiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IE-PINN is a novel neural network method for robustly estimating heterogeneous elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data, overcoming limitations of existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating elasticity parameters are unstable, noise-sensitive, and struggle with absolute-scale Young's modulus recovery.

Method: IE-PINN uses three neural networks for displacement, strain, and elasticity fields, a two-phase estimation strategy, and innovations like positional encoding and sine activation.

Result: IE-PINN achieves accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: IE-PINN advances elasticity parameter estimation, with significant potential for noisy clinical and mechanical applications.

Abstract: Accurately estimating spatially heterogeneous elasticity parameters, particularly Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, from noisy displacement measurements remains significantly challenging in inverse elasticity problems. Existing inverse estimation techniques are often limited by instability, pronounced sensitivity to measurement noise, and difficulty in recovering absolute-scale Young's modulus. This work presents a novel Inverse Elasticity Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) specifically designed to robustly reconstruct heterogeneous distributions of elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data based on linear elasticity physics. IE-PINN integrates three distinct neural network architectures dedicated to separately modeling displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, thereby significantly enhancing stability and accuracy against measurement noise. Additionally, a two-phase estimation strategy is introduced: the first phase recovers relative spatial distributions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and the second phase calibrates the absolute scale of Young's modulus using imposed loading boundary conditions. Additional methodological innovations, including positional encoding, sine activation functions, and a sequential pretraining protocol, further enhance the model's performance and robustness. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that IE-PINN effectively overcomes critical limitations encountered by existing methods, delivering accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise conditions. This advancement holds substantial potential for clinical imaging diagnostics and mechanical characterization, where measurements typically encounter substantial noise.

*Parikshit Ram, Kenneth L. Clarkson, Tim Klinger, Shashanka Ubaru, Alexander G. Gray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse transformers, especially input-dependent ones, improve learnability and generalization compared to standard attention, while input-agnostic sparse attention offers no benefits. Theoretical analysis links softmax stability and Lipschitz properties to these outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sparse attention mechanisms affect learnability and generalization in transformers, beyond just computational efficiency.

Method: Empirical study of various attention mechanisms (input-dependent and input-agnostic sparse attention) and theoretical analysis of softmax stability and Lipschitz properties.

Result: Input-dependent sparse attention converges faster and generalizes better; input-agnostic sparse attention shows no benefits. Theoretical conditions validate these findings.

Conclusion: Input-dependent sparse attention enhances learning by focusing semantic attention, while input-agnostic sparse attention lacks such advantages, as confirmed by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Various forms of sparse attention have been explored to mitigate the quadratic computational and memory cost of the attention mechanism in transformers. We study sparse transformers not through a lens of efficiency but rather in terms of learnability and generalization. Empirically studying a range of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention models, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a phenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter choices. This can be interpreted as demonstrating that concentrating a model's "semantic focus" with respect to the tokens currently being considered (in the form of input-dependent sparse attention) accelerates learning. We develop a theoretical characterization of the conditions that explain this behavior. We establish a connection between the stability of the standard softmax and the loss function's Lipschitz properties, then show how sparsity affects the stability of the softmax and the subsequent convergence and generalization guarantees resulting from the attention mechanism. This allows us to theoretically establish that input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide any benefits. We also characterize conditions when semantic focus (input-dependent sparse attention) can provide improved guarantees, and we validate that these conditions are in fact met in our empirical evaluations.

### [398] [RL-Obfuscation: Can Language Models Learn to Evade Latent-Space Monitors?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14261)
*Rohan Gupta, Erik Jenner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can be trained to evade latent-space monitors, with token-level monitors being vulnerable while holistic ones remain robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can learn to evade latent-space monitors designed to detect undesirable behaviors.

Method: Introduces RL-Obfuscation, a reinforcement learning-based method to finetune LLMs to bypass monitors while maintaining coherent outputs.

Result: Token-level monitors are highly vulnerable; holistic monitors (e.g., max-pooling or attention-based) remain robust. Adversarial policies generalize to unseen monitors.

Conclusion: LLMs can evade certain monitors by repurposing tokens internally, highlighting the need for more robust monitoring approaches.

Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in large language models by leveraging internal model representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors? To study this, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent generations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type. Finally, we study how the policy learned by RL bypasses these monitors and find that the model can also learn to repurpose tokens to mean something different internally.

*Yuan Zhuang, Yi Shen, Zhili Zhang, Yuxiao Chen, Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: YOLO-MARL is a framework using LLMs once for high-level planning in MARL, reducing costs and improving cooperative strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in MARL for cooperative games and the high cost of frequent LLM use motivate a one-time LLM integration.

Method: YOLO-MARL uses LLMs once for strategy generation, state interpretation, and planning, then trains decentralized policies without LLMs.

Result: YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms in cooperative games.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines LLMs' planning with MARL, reducing costs while enhancing performance.

Abstract: Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained decentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms.

*Mengda Ji, Genjiu Xu, Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes CORA, a coalition-level credit assignment method for MARL, addressing over-updating by decomposing advantages using cooperative game theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current credit assignment methods in MARL often overlook coalition-level contributions, leading to suboptimal policies.

Method: CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions and decomposes them using the core solution from cooperative game theory, with random coalition sampling for efficiency.

Result: CORA outperforms baselines in matrix games, differential games, and collaboration tasks, especially in scenarios with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment, as demonstrated by CORA, is crucial for enhancing MARL performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima. These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) and a deep learning model (S3PO) for super-resolution, addressing distortion and dataset limitations in 360° videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited spatial resolution and distortion in 360° videos hinder immersive VR experiences, and existing VSR techniques lack adaptation to 360° content.

Method: The paper proposes S3PO, a recurrent model with attention, a custom feature extractor, and a distortion-aware loss function, tested on the new 360VDS dataset.

Result: S3PO outperforms state-of-the-art VSR and 360°-specific models, validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The work advances 360° video super-resolution by addressing unique challenges and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360° videos) are widely used in Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences. However, the limited spatial resolution in 360° videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360° video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360° video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360° videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360° Video Super-Resolution (360° VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°~specific super-resolution models on 360° video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability of Speech LLMs to process multi-channel audio with spatial cues is understudied, prompting the need for a solution like directional-SpeechLlama.

Method: The approach uses smart glasses' microphone arrays and introduces two techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA).

Result: Directional-SpeechLlama effectively links textual cues with spatial audio, excelling in speech recognition and source localization.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the gap in multi-channel audio processing for Speech LLMs, demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM) with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities. However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research. In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition and source localization tasks.

TL;DR: HAC is a neural speech codec that disentangles speech into acoustic, phonetic, and lexical levels using knowledge distillation, outperforming baselines in quality and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified speech representation that bridges acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream tasks.

Method: HAC uses a factorized bottleneck with three linguistic levels and leverages knowledge distillation from HuBERT (phoneme-level) and LaBSE (lexical cues).

Result: HAC tokens are disentangled (aligned with phonemes and word-level semantics) and outperform single-level baselines in naturalness and reconstruction.

Conclusion: HAC is a promising unified discrete speech representation for speech generation and understanding.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel methods (DTM and TITAN) for detecting neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) by analyzing higher-order linguistic macrostructures in visual-stimulated narratives, outperforming traditional microstructural approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of NCDs is vital, and while current methods focus on linguistic microstructures, higher-order macrostructures remain underexplored despite their potential to reflect cognitive abilities.

Method: Two dynamic macrostructural approaches are introduced: (1) Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) for topic evolution tracking, and (2) Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) for cross-modal consistency measurement.

Result: TITAN achieved superior performance (F1 = 0.7238 and 0.8889 on two corpora), with macrostructural features like topic variability and consistency being key contributors.

Conclusion: Macrostructural patterns are critical for NCD detection, offering deeper insights into cognitive impairment mechanisms compared to microstructural features.

Abstract: Early detection of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is crucial for timely intervention and disease management. Given that language impairments manifest early in NCD progression, visual-stimulated narrative (VSN)-based analysis offers a promising avenue for NCD detection. Current VSN-based NCD detection methods primarily focus on linguistic microstructures (e.g., pauses, lexical diversity), which are potentially linked to bottom-up (stimulus-driven) cognitive processing. While these features illuminate basic language abilities, the higher-order linguistic macrostructures (e.g., thematic or logical development), which may reflect top-down (concept-driven) cognitive abilities, remain underexplored. These patterns are crucial for NCD detection yet challenging to quantify due to their abstract and complex nature. To bridge this gap, we propose two novel dynamic macrostructural approaches: (1) Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) to track topic evolution over time, and (2) Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to measure cross-modal consistency between speech and visual stimuli. Experimental results validated the efficiency of proposed approaches in NCD detection, with TITAN achieving superior performance both on the CU-MARVEL-RABBIT corpus (F1 = 0.7238) and the ADReSS corpus (F1 = 0.8889). The feature contribution analysis revealed that macrostructural features (e.g., topic variability, topic change rate, and topic consistency) constituted the most significant contributors in the model's decision pathways, outperforming investigated microstructural features. These findings underscore the critical role of macrostructural patterns in understanding cognitive impairment mechanisms in NCDs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Deformer', a deformable CNN variant replacing depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture, improving speech recognition by adapting to asymmetric kernels and coupling better with attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs assume symmetric and rigid kernels, limiting their ability to capture asymmetric patterns. This study explores whether asymmetric kernels can improve feature coupling with attention.

Method: The authors replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer with deformable counterparts ('Deformer'), analyzing local receptive fields, global attention maps, and kernel offsets.

Result: Deformer improves WER by +5.6% (without LM) and +6.4% (with LM) over the Conformer baseline on the WSJ eval92 set.

Conclusion: Adaptive kernels in Deformer enhance feature associations and performance, demonstrating the value of flexible local feature extraction in speech recognition.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline on the WSJ eval92 set.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive masking approach for pruning multilingual ASR models, achieving better performance than existing methods and reducing the need for language-specific pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network pruning for multilingual ASR models requires multiple rounds of pruning and re-training per language, which is inefficient.

Method: An adaptive masking approach is used in two scenarios: creating sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (Dynamic ASR Pathways), dynamically adapting sub-networks without fixed structures.

Result: The approach outperforms existing pruning methods for sparse monolingual models and discovers better sub-networks for multilingual models.

Conclusion: Dynamic ASR Pathways efficiently prunes multilingual ASR models, reducing language-specific pruning needs and improving performance.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

TL;DR: MixRep is a data augmentation method for low-resource ASR, combining mixup with time-axis regularization, outperforming other methods like SpecAugment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve low-resource ASR performance by generalizing mixup techniques and adding complementary regularization.

Method: MixRep interpolates hidden representations in neural networks, applied to acoustic features and layer outputs, combined with time-axis regularization. Tested on Conformer encoder with E2E LAS architecture and CTC loss.

Result: Achieves +6.5% and +6.7% relative WER reduction on WSJ and SWB datasets compared to SpecAugment.

Conclusion: MixRep is effective for low-resource ASR, outperforming existing regularization methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Matterport Pro3, a consumer-grade 3D scanning device, for large-scale environment reconstruction. We conduct detailed scanning (1,099 scanning points) of a six-floor building (17,567 square meters) and assess the device's effectiveness, limitations, and performance enhancements in diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection system using edge-deployed deep learning models, achieving high accuracy and efficiency on various edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR is a major cause of vision impairment in diabetics, and traditional manual diagnosis is slow and resource-heavy. Edge AI offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative.

Method: Curated and preprocessed 3,662 retinal fundus images, trained multiple CNNs (MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, custom DNN), optimized for edge deployment via TensorFlowLite and 8-bit quantization.

Result: MobileNet achieved 96.45% accuracy; SqueezeNet showed 17 ms latency and 176 KB size. ShuffleNet and custom DNN excelled in resource efficiency for low-end devices.

Conclusion: Edge AI enables scalable, timely DR detection, especially in resource-limited settings, with minimal accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045. Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

### [410] [Improving Prostate Gland Segmenting Using Transformer based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14844)
*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study compares transformer models (UNETR and SwinUNETR) with a 3D UNet for prostate gland segmentation in T2-weighted MRI, showing SwinUNETR's superior performance in handling inter-reader variability and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like inter-reader variability and cross-site domain shifts in prostate MRI segmentation, the study explores transformer models' precision.

Method: Three training strategies (single cohort, cross-validated mixed cohort, gland size-based) were tested on 546 MRI volumes annotated by two experts, with hyperparameters tuned by Optuna.

Result: SwinUNETR outperformed UNETR and 3D UNet, achieving higher Dice scores (up to 0.902) and robustness against label noise and class imbalance.

Conclusion: SwinUNETR's global and shifted-window self-attention improves segmentation accuracy, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

*Yufeng Zhang, Wenrui Dai, Hang Yu, Shizhan Liu, Junhui Hou, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ABC is a novel framework for Neural Image Compression (NIC) that achieves computational scalability through Bayesian network structure learning, addressing the high computational demands of NIC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of NIC is limited by its high computational complexity, and existing solutions lack comprehensive control over this complexity.

Method: ABC introduces a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet for neural backbone computations, a homogeneous multipartite BayesNet for autoregressive unit optimization, and an adaptive control module for dynamic adjustments.

Result: ABC provides full computational scalability, better complexity adaptivity, and broader control span while maintaining competitive compression performance.

Conclusion: ABC is a versatile and robust solution for scalable NIC applications, compatible with various architectures using BayesNet representations.

Abstract: Neural Image Compression (NIC) has revolutionized image compression with its superior rate-distortion performance and multi-task capabilities, supporting both human visual perception and machine vision tasks. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by substantial computational demands. While existing approaches attempt to address this challenge through module-specific optimizations or pre-defined complexity levels, they lack comprehensive control over computational complexity. We present ABC (Adaptive BayesNet structure learning for computational scalable multi-task image Compression), a novel, comprehensive framework that achieves computational scalability across all NIC components through Bayesian network (BayesNet) structure learning. ABC introduces three key innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet (inter-node structure) for managing neural backbone computations; (ii) a homogeneous multipartite BayesNet (intra-node structure) for optimizing autoregressive unit processing; and (iii) an adaptive control module that dynamically adjusts the BayesNet structure based on device capabilities, input data complexity, and downstream task requirements. Experiments demonstrate that ABC enables full computational scalability with better complexity adaptivity and broader complexity control span, while maintaining competitive compression performance. Furthermore, the framework's versatility allows integration with various NIC architectures that employ BayesNet representations, making it a robust solution for ensuring computational scalability in NIC applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on facial images, was fine-tuned for biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival). Both models showed high accuracy and robustness, outperforming benchmarks and providing complementary prognostic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop noninvasive, scalable facial biomarkers for biological age estimation and survival risk prediction using a foundation model.

Method: FAHR-FaceAge was fine-tuned on public images, while FAHR-FaceSurvival used cancer patient photos. Both models were tested for robustness and clinically validated in independent datasets.

Result: FAHR-FaceAge achieved a mean absolute error of 5.1 years for age estimation and outperformed benchmarks. FAHR-FaceSurvival predicted mortality robustly, with the highest-risk group having triple the mortality. Both models generalized well across demographics.

Conclusion: A single foundation model can generate accurate, scalable facial biomarkers for aging and mortality risk, enhancing prognostic accuracy when combined.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets.

*Paula Feldman, Miguel Fainstein, Viviana Siless, Claudio Delrieux, Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) to generate accurate and diverse 3D blood vessel models, addressing limitations of rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based methods for synthesizing vasculature lack the diversity and complexity of real anatomical data, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: The authors developed an RvNN that learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity and geometry features, enabling the generation of new vessel geometries.

Result: The generated 3D blood vessel models closely resemble real data in terms of vessel radii, length, and tortuosity, even in datasets with aneurysms.

Conclusion: This work is the first to use RvNN for blood vessel synthesis, offering potential benefits for medical training, simulations, and other applications.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL methods fail to effectively use multi-modal MRI and clinical data for neurological disorder diagnosis, limiting performance.

Method: A transformer-based MoE framework leverages aMRI, DTI, and fMRI alongside clinical data, using modality-specific experts and adaptive fusion.

Result: The framework achieves 82.47% validation accuracy, outperforming baselines by over 10%.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, especially for overlapping disease states, demonstrating real-world clinical potential.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (DenseNet-121) is developed to classify 8 body mpMRI series types, achieving high accuracy (0.972) and performing well on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorrect DICOM headers in mpMRI exams due to protocol diversity and technologist errors hinder radiologists' efficiency.

Method: Multiple deep learning classifiers (ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet) are trained and compared using mpMRI data from various institutions. The best model (DenseNet-121) is evaluated under different training data quantities and on out-of-distribution datasets.

Result: DenseNet-121 achieves the highest F1-score (0.966) and accuracy (0.972). It performs well (>0.95 accuracy) with sufficient training data (729+ studies) and maintains good accuracy on external datasets (0.872 and 0.810).

Conclusion: The DenseNet-121 model effectively classifies mpMRI series types, improving radiologists' workflow efficiency, and generalizes well to external datasets.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

*Jonghun Kim, Gyeongdeok Jo, Shinyoung Ra, Hyunjin Park*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed an HE inference framework for medical images using VQGAN for compression and polynomial approximations for activation functions, balancing efficiency and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data requires privacy protection, but HE inference is computationally expensive for large images like chest X-rays.

Method: Uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, approximates activation functions with low-degree polynomials, and adapts squeeze and excitation modules for HE.

Result: Downsampling by eight optimized performance and cost. HE inference is slower but feasible for medical image tasks.

Conclusion: The framework shows practical potential for secure medical image analysis despite minor performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

TL;DR: FedWSIDD is a federated learning approach for Whole Slide Image classification using dataset distillation to address computational heterogeneity and privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative medical image analysis while preserving patient privacy and handling heterogeneous computational resources.

Method: Uses dataset distillation (DD) to create synthetic slides, incorporates stain normalization, and transmits synthetic slides instead of model parameters.

Result: Improves local WSI classification performance, offers flexibility for heterogeneous models, and preserves privacy.

Conclusion: FedWSIDD is an effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks in federated settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.

TL;DR: The paper addresses noise issues in ultra-compact analog image sensors for single-use endoscopes, proposing a hybrid denoising system combining traditional and learning-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-use endoscopes with tiny sensors reduce costs and infection risks but suffer from noise due to limited photosensitive area, simplified circuits, and analog transmission.

Method: Developed a noise model for three primary noise types and proposed a hybrid denoising system combining traditional and learning-based techniques.

Result: The system reduces noise without detail loss or color distortion, achieving real-time performance and improving PSNR from 21.16 to 33.05.

Conclusion: The hybrid denoising system effectively addresses noise in ultra-compact endoscope sensors, enhancing image quality for medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.

*Zijie Wang, Ryuichi Umehara, Mitsuhiro Nakamura, Megumi Nakao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A MeshVAE-based organ shape atlas is proposed for clinical applications, achieving accurate reconstruction of liver and stomach shapes with hierarchical latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of linear and conventional nonlinear models in representing highly variable soft organ shapes, enabling better control and interpretation.

Method: Uses a mesh variational autoencoder (MeshVAE) with hierarchical latent variables to represent complex organ shapes and nonlinear differences between individuals.

Result: Achieved average vertex distances of 1.5 mm (liver) and 1.4 mm (stomach) for reconstruction, with hierarchical separation of shape features.

Conclusion: The MeshVAE-based atlas effectively represents and controls organ shapes hierarchically, outperforming PCA in feature separation.

Abstract: An organ shape atlas, which represents the shape and position of the organs and skeleton of a living body using a small number of parameters, is expected to have a wide range of clinical applications, including intraoperative guidance and radiotherapy. Because the shape and position of soft organs vary greatly among patients, it is difficult for linear models to reconstruct shapes that have large local variations. Because it is difficult for conventional nonlinear models to control and interpret the organ shapes obtained, deep learning has been attracting attention in three-dimensional shape representation. In this study, we propose an organ shape atlas based on a mesh variational autoencoder (MeshVAE) with hierarchical latent variables. To represent the complex shapes of biological organs and nonlinear shape differences between individuals, the proposed method maintains the performance of organ shape reconstruction by hierarchizing latent variables and enables shape representation using lower-dimensional latent variables. Additionally, templates that define vertex correspondence between different resolutions enable hierarchical representation in mesh data and control the global and local features of the organ shape. We trained the model using liver and stomach organ meshes obtained from 124 cases and confirmed that the model reconstructed the position and shape with an average distance between vertices of 1.5 mm and mean distance of 0.7 mm for the liver shape, and an average distance between vertices of 1.4 mm and mean distance of 0.8 mm for the stomach shape on test data from 19 of cases. The proposed method continuously represented interpolated shapes, and by changing latent variables at different hierarchical levels, the proposed method hierarchically separated shape features compared with PCA.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

### [423] [ATFusion: An Alternate Cross-Attention Transformer Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11675)
*Han Yan, Songlei Xiong, Long Wang, Lihua Jian, Gemine Vivone*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ATFusion, a Transformer-based network for fusing infrared and visible images, addressing limitations in extracting discrepancy information and improving fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based fusion methods overlook discrepancy information, limiting performance. The paper aims to enhance fusion by addressing this gap.

Method: ATFusion introduces a discrepancy information injection module (DIIM) and alternate common information injection modules (ACIIM), leveraging modified cross-attention mechanisms. A segmented pixel loss function aids training.

Result: ATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets, achieving better texture detail and structure preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed ATFusion effectively combines infrared and visible images, demonstrating superior performance in fusion tasks.

Abstract: The fusion of infrared and visible images is essential in remote sensing applications, as it combines the thermal information of infrared images with the detailed texture of visible images for more accurate analysis in tasks like environmental monitoring, target detection, and disaster management. The current fusion methods based on Transformer techniques for infrared and visible (IV) images have exhibited promising performance. However, the attention mechanism of the previous Transformer-based methods was prone to extract common information from source images without considering the discrepancy information, which limited fusion performance. In this paper, by reevaluating the cross-attention mechanism, we propose an alternate Transformer fusion network (ATFusion) to fuse IV images. Our ATFusion consists of one discrepancy information injection module (DIIM) and two alternate common information injection modules (ACIIM). The DIIM is designed by modifying the vanilla cross-attention mechanism, which can promote the extraction of the discrepancy information of the source images. Meanwhile, the ACIIM is devised by alternately using the vanilla cross-attention mechanism, which can fully mine common information and integrate long dependencies. Moreover, the successful training of ATFusion is facilitated by a proposed segmented pixel loss function, which provides a good trade-off for texture detail and salient structure preservation. The qualitative and quantitative results on public datasets indicate our ATFusion is effective and superior compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

*Omer F. Atli, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Arda C. Demirtas, Mahmut Yurt, Onat Dalmaz, Tolga Çukur*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: I2I-Mamba, a novel multi-modal medical image synthesis method, uses dual-domain Mamba blocks and spiral-scan SSM operators to capture contextual features effectively, outperforming CNNs, transformers, and SSMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CNNs and transformers struggle with balancing local precision and long-range context sensitivity in multi-modal medical image synthesis.

Method: I2I-Mamba employs dual-domain Mamba (ddMamba) blocks for contextual modeling in image and Fourier domains, using spiral-scan SSM operators and convolutional layers for spatial precision.

Result: I2I-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs, transformers, and SSMs in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols.

Conclusion: I2I-Mamba effectively addresses the trade-offs in contextual feature capture, offering superior performance in multi-modal medical image synthesis.

Abstract: Multi-modal medical image synthesis involves nonlinear transformation of tissue signals between source and target modalities, where tissues exhibit contextual interactions across diverse spatial distances. As such, the utility of a network architecture in synthesis depends on its ability to express these contextual features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer high local precision at the expense of poor sensitivity to long-range context. While transformers promise to alleviate this issue, they suffer from an unfavorable trade-off between sensitivity to long- versus short-range context due to the intrinsic complexity of attention filters. To effectively capture contextual features while avoiding the complexity-driven trade-offs, here we introduce a novel multi-modal synthesis method, I2I-Mamba, based on the state space modeling (SSM) framework. Focusing on semantic representations across a hybrid residual architecture, I2I-Mamba leverages novel dual-domain Mamba (ddMamba) blocks for complementary contextual modeling in image and Fourier domains, while maintaining spatial precision with convolutional layers. Diverting from conventional raster-scan trajectories, ddMamba leverages novel SSM operators based on a spiral-scan trajectory to learn context with enhanced radial coverage and angular isotropy, and a channel-mixing layer to aggregate context across the channel dimension. Comprehensive demonstrations on multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNNs, transformers and SSMs.

### [425] [Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03780)
*Yodai Suzuki, Ryosuke Isono, Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees is proposed, addressing limitations of existing PnP methods by integrating primal-dual splitting (PDS) for broader applicability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PnP methods lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions and often require high computational costs for non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and constraints.

Method: The proposed approach integrates PnP with primal-dual splitting (PDS) to develop a convergent framework, solving a general monotone inclusion problem rather than standard convex optimization.

Result: Theoretical conditions for convergence are established, and numerical experiments validate the algorithm's practicality and effectiveness in image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed PnP-PDS framework offers a theoretically sound and efficient solution for a broad class of image restoration problems.

Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for noise-inclusive fully unsupervised anomaly detection (FUAD) lack performance and scalability. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: SSFilter uses batch-level anomaly scoring via mutual patch comparison, regression errors, and prediction uncertainty to estimate sample-level scores. It includes anomaly synthesis and integrity enhancement for training.

Result: SSFilter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Real-IAD FUAD benchmark and enhances other UAD methods via dataset-level filtering.

Conclusion: SSFilter offers a scalable, model-agnostic solution for FUAD, improving robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Noise-inclusive fully unsupervised anomaly detection (FUAD) holds significant practical relevance. Although various methods exist to address this problem, they are limited in both performance and scalability. Our work seeks to overcome these obstacles, enabling broader adaptability of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) models to FUAD. To achieve this, we introduce the Synergy Scoring Filter (SSFilter), the first fully unsupervised anomaly detection approach to leverage sample-level filtering. SSFilter facilitates end-to-end robust training and applies filtering to the complete training set post-training, offering a model-agnostic solution for FUAD. Specifically, SSFilter integrates a batch-level anomaly scoring mechanism based on mutual patch comparison and utilizes regression errors in anomalous regions, alongside prediction uncertainty, to estimate sample-level uncertainty scores that calibrate the anomaly scoring mechanism. This design produces a synergistic, robust filtering approach. Furthermore, we propose a realistic anomaly synthesis method and an integrity enhancement strategy to improve model training and mitigate missed noisy samples. Our method establishes state-of-the-art performance on the FUAD benchmark of the recent large-scale industrial anomaly detection dataset, Real-IAD. Additionally, dataset-level filtering enhances the performance of various UAD methods on the FUAD benchmark, and the high scalability of our approach significantly boosts its practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in collecting annotated ophthalmic surgical videos due to privacy and labor constraints motivates the need for synthetic video generation.

Method: Ophora uses a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to create a dataset (Ophora-160K) and a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to adapt a pre-trained T2V model for surgical video generation.

Result: Ophora generates realistic and reliable surgical videos, validated by quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback, and aids downstream workflow understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Ophora successfully addresses the challenge of generating synthetic ophthalmic surgical videos, demonstrating practical utility for AI-assisted surgery.

Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.

Abstract: Synthesizing high quality CT projection data remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of annotated data and the complex nature of CT imaging. In this work, we present PRO, a projection domain synthesis foundation model for CT imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that performs CT synthesis in the projection domain.

This projection domain strategy enables more faithful modeling of underlying imaging physics and anatomical structures. Moreover, PRO functions as a foundation model, capable of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves performance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and sparse-view reconstruction. These findings underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection domain synthesis as a powerful tool for data augmentation and robust CT imaging.
