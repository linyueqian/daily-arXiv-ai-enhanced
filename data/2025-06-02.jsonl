Different from the existing methods that\nsuffer from poor expression due to linear function approximation, we propose a\ndistributed neural policy gradient algorithm that features two innovatively\ndesigned neural networks, specifically for the approximate Q-functions and\npolicy functions of agents. This distributed neural policy gradient algorithm\nconsists of two key components: the distributed critic step and the\ndecentralized actor step. In the distributed critic step, agents receive the\napproximate Q-function parameters from their neighboring agents via a\ntime-varying communication networks to collaboratively evaluate the joint\npolicy. In contrast, in the decentralized actor step, each agent updates its\nlocal policy parameter solely based on its own approximate Q-function. In the\nconvergence analysis, we first establish the global convergence of agents for\nthe joint policy evaluation in the distributed critic step. Subsequently, we\nrigorously demonstrate the global convergence of the overall distributed neural\npolicy gradient algorithm with respect to the objective function. Finally, the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with a\ncentralized algorithm through simulation in the robot path planning\nenvironment."}

We argue that such systems have\npreviously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin\ndescriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and\ntherefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.\nBy contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have\ndeveloped frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal\nrepresentations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual\ninformation needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can\neffectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the\nverbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)\nautomating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially\novercoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human\nmeaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about\ndeveloping new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame\nthis as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify\nfive key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,\nintegrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,\ndistinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and\nacknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest\nthat thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to\naddress a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing\nculture in (or using) LLMs."}

In this work, we present an initial\nexploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn\nmultimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration,\nwe particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert\nannotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack\nsuch complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at\nboth global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k\nprompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled\npreference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal\nunderstanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages\ntool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this\ngoal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting\njudges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of\n\\InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the\nmulti-turn scaling law of judge model. We hope the open-source of our data can\nhelp facilitate further research on aligning current MLLMs to the next step.\nOur project website can be found at https://pku-intermt.github.io ."}

As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human\nlife, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden\non humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich\nscenarios.\n  To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal\nretrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance\nto humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve\nsituational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and\nreasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and\ntext. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG\nexplores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for\nadaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate\nits capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked\nMulti-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video\nunderstanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to\nexisting open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large\nvision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input\ndata.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce SpeechVerifer to\nproactively verify speech integrity using only the published speech itself,\ni.e., without requiring any external references. Inspired by audio\nfingerprinting and watermarking, SpeechVerifier can (i) effectively detect\ntampering attacks, (ii) be robust to benign operations and (iii) verify the\nintegrity only based on published speeches. Briefly, SpeechVerifier utilizes\nmultiscale feature extraction to capture speech features across different\ntemporal resolutions. Then, it employs contrastive learning to generate\nfingerprints that can detect modifications at varying granularities. These\nfingerprints are designed to be robust to benign operations, but exhibit\nsignificant changes when malicious tampering occurs. To enable speech\nverification in a self-contained manner, the generated fingerprints are then\nembedded into the speech signal by segment-wise watermarking.

FABLE adapts eight classical\ndata-flow analyses from software engineering: reaching definitions, very busy\nexpressions, available expressions, live variable analysis, interval analysis,\ntype-state analysis, taint analysis, and concurrency analysis. These analyses\nare instantiated across three real-world domains: cooking recipes, travel\nroutes, and automated plans. The benchmark includes 2,400 question-answer\npairs, with 100 examples for each domain-analysis combination. We evaluate\nthree types of LLMs: a reasoning-focused model (DeepSeek-R1 8B), a\ngeneral-purpose model (LLaMA 3.1 8B), and a code-specific model (Granite Code\n8B). Each model is tested using majority voting over five sampled completions\nper prompt. Results show that the reasoning model achieves higher accuracy, but\nat the cost of over 20 times slower inference compared to the other models. In\ncontrast, the general-purpose and code-specific models perform close to random\nchance. FABLE provides the first diagnostic benchmark to systematically\nevaluate data-flow reasoning and offers insights for developing models with\nstronger procedural understanding."}

The proposed\nmethod employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention\nnetwork to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant\nparts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We\nincorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance\ncategories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the\ntexts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align\nextracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to\naccurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsignificant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\\% in accuracy and\n17.36\\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it\nachieves average gains of 7.02\\% in accuracy and 10.92\\% in F1-score. On the\nP-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\\% in accuracy and\n11.18\\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media\ncontent."}

Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional\nalignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was\nassociated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than\noverlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically\ndifferent, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for\narousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer,\nmore consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping\nspeech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW\nindicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination\nstrategies.

To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.\n(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not\nsubstantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale\nduring training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when\ntraining GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a\nproxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be\ntrusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS\nevolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that\nCBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus\nas training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across\ndifferent model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can\ninform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over\ntraining motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language\nmodels at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the\nCBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to\nslightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient\nsteps.

Recent work has shown that\nbasic rounding-based quantization schemes pose security risks, as they can be\nexploited to inject malicious behaviors into quantized models that remain\nhidden in full precision. However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more\ncomplex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular\nollama and llama.cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by\nintroducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization\nerror -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their\n(de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct\nmalicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging\nthis, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while\nconstraining its weights based on quantization errors. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our attack on three popular LLMs across nine GGUF quantization\ndata types on three diverse attack scenarios: insecure code generation\n($\\Delta$=$88.7\\%$), targeted content injection ($\\Delta$=$85.0\\%$), and benign\ninstruction refusal ($\\Delta$=$30.1\\%$).

On the other hand, supervised methods suffer from the lack\nof large training datasets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with\neffective prompt engineering are found to be effective to overcome the issue of\nunavailability of large training dataset. Yet, in existing literature, there\ndoes not exist comprehensive works on causality detection and mining using LLM\nprompting. In this paper, we present several retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) based dynamic prompting schemes to enhance LLM performance in causality\ndetection and extraction tasks. Extensive experiments over three datasets and\nfive LLMs validate the superiority of our proposed RAG-based dynamic prompting\nover other static prompting schemes."}

Design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege,\ncomplete mediation, and psychological acceptability have helped guide the\ndesign of mechanisms for securing information systems over the last five\ndecades, and we argue that their explicit and conscientious adoption will help\nsecure agentic systems. To illustrate this approach, we introduce AgentSandbox,\na conceptual framework embedding these security principles to provide\nsafeguards throughout an agent's life-cycle.

More\nimportantly, simply adopting existing NLP technologies, e.g., retrieving and\nthen cross-checking, is not a one-size-fits-all solution due to the gap between\ntextual similarity and idea conception. In this paper, we propose to harness\nlarge language models (LLMs) for scientific novelty detection (ND), associated\nwith two new datasets in marketing and NLP domains. To construct the\nconsiderate datasets for ND, we propose to extract closure sets of papers based\non their relationship, and then summarize their main ideas based on LLMs. To\ncapture idea conception, we propose to train a lightweight retriever by\ndistilling the idea-level knowledge from LLMs to align ideas with similar\nconception, enabling efficient and accurate idea retrieval for LLM novelty\ndetection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms others on the\nproposed benchmark datasets for idea retrieval and ND tasks.

In this work, we argue that such\naxioms are often too restrictive, and propose in response a new feature\nattribution framework, built from the ground up. Rather than imposing axioms,\nwe start by defining attributions for the simplest possible models, i.e.,\nindicator functions, and use these as building blocks for more complex models.\nWe then show that one recovers several existing attribution methods, depending\non the choice of atomic attribution. Subsequently, we derive closed-form\nexpressions for attribution of deep ReLU networks, and take a step toward the\noptimization of evaluation metrics with respect to feature attributions."}

A key innovation is its in-depth analysis of solver-internal features --\nparticularly by comparing distributions of key solver outputs including root\nnode gap, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage -- leveraging the\nsolver's dynamic solution behavior as an `expert assessment' to reveal nuanced\ncomputational resemblances. By offering a structured approach with clearly\ndefined solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics, our benchmark aims to\nfacilitate robust comparisons among diverse generation techniques, spur the\ndevelopment of higher-quality instance generators, and ultimately enhance the\nreliability of research reliant on synthetic MILP data. The framework's\neffectiveness in systematically comparing the fidelity of instance sets is\ndemonstrated using contemporary generative models."}

However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video\nediting, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and\nvisual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in\nslow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a\nnovel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation\nthat text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the\npretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention\nlayers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the\nfirst stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos\nproduced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax\noptimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.\nSpecifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise (\"bad\nnoise\") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains\nthe model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging\nconditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object\nremoval results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,\nsignificantly improving inference efficiency.

MADCluster consists of\nthree main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal\ndynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous\ncenter updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying\nvarious architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall\nperformance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of\nMADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various\narchitectures."}

In this work, we focus\non two-layer linear denoising autoencoders trained under gradient flow,\nincorporating two key ingredients of modern deep learning architectures: A\nlow-dimensional bottleneck layer that effectively enforces a rank constraint on\nthe learned solution, as well as the possibility of a skip connection that\nbypasses the bottleneck. We derive closed-form expressions for all critical\npoints of this model under product regularization, and in particular describe\nits global minimizer under the minimum-norm principle. From there, we derive\nthe test risk formula in the overparameterized regime, both for models with and\nwithout skip connections. Our analysis reveals two interesting phenomena:\nFirstly, the bottleneck layer introduces an additional complexity measure akin\nto the classical bias-variance trade-off -- increasing the bottleneck width\nreduces bias but introduces variance, and vice versa. Secondly, skip connection\ncan mitigate the variance in denoising autoencoders -- especially when the\nmodel is mildly overparameterized. We further analyze the impact of skip\nconnections in denoising autoencoder using random matrix theory and support our\nclaims with numerical evidence."}

To address these issues, we propose a novel method called\nMetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance\nhatred and toxicity detection.

Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on\nhand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise\nerror diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel\nframework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired\nby software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language\nqueries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down\ntasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for\ncomplex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function\nimplementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores\nsuccessfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while\nleveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both\nexecution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder\nachieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution\nreliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of\ncode-centric approaches in tool learning."}

Unlike previous works that typically\nrely on additional training to learn such coefficients, our approach requires\nno training.

Here we present Neural Force\nField (NFF), a framework extending Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE)\nto learn complex object interactions through force field representations, which\ncan be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\nsolver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on\ndiscrete latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as\ngravity, support, and collision in continuous explicit force fields.\nExperiments on three challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF,\ntrained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen\nscenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient\nforward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement.\nOur work suggests that incorporating physics-inspired representations into\nlearning systems can help bridge the gap between artificial and human physical\nreasoning capabilities."}

To address these issues, we propose Base model Oriented\nSystematic Evaluation (BOSE), a method specifically designed to optimize the\nevaluation of base models.

Specifically, we\nsystematically analyze the model-generated error types and introduce an\nerror-type grounded mistake augmentation method to collect diverse and\nrepresentative errors. Correct solutions are either from fixing the errors or\ngenerating a fresh start. Through a model-aware smooth reflection connection,\nthe erroneous solution is transferred to the correct one.

Graded entity salience\naddresses this need by assigning entities scores that reflect their relative\nimportance in a text. Existing approaches fall into two main categories:\nsubjective judgments of salience, which allow for gradient scoring but lack\nconsistency, and summarization-based methods, which define salience as\nmention-worthiness in a summary, promoting explainability but limiting outputs\nto binary labels (entities are either summary-worthy or not).

Using an English dataset spanning 12 spoken and\nwritten genres, we collect 5 summaries per document and calculate each entity's\nsalience score based on its presence across these summaries.

While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing\nmethods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high\ncomputational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a\ncritical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we\npropose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning,\ncertain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across\ntraining iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision\nactivation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically\nsuppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight\noperations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling\nwhile reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks\nvalidate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA\nreasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory\nsavings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the\nPhi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance,\nand deployability.

Remarkably, our\nmethod exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities,\ndespite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning\nskills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving\npreviously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and\ncomprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation\nlearning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero. This work represents a\nsubstantial advancement toward developing truly generalizable robotic\nfoundation models endowed with robust reasoning capacities."}

We explore how these architectural\nconstraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of\n$\\textit{retrieval}$ and $\\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al.\n[2024a].

However, existing methods often fail to capture the\nevolving structure of neural connectivity in ways that capture its relationship\nto behavior, especially in dynamic, uncertain, or high-dimensional settings\nwith sufficient resolution or interpretability. We introduce the Temporal\nAttention-enhanced Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Network (TAVRNN), a novel\nframework that models time-varying neuronal connectivity by integrating\nprobabilistic graph learning with temporal attention mechanisms. TAVRNN learns\nlatent dynamics at the single-unit level while maintaining interpretable\npopulation-level representations, to identify key connectivity patterns linked\nto behavior. TAVRNN generalizes across diverse neural systems and modalities,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art classification and clustering performance. We\nvalidate TAVRNN on three diverse datasets: (1) electrophysiological data from a\nfreely behaving rat, (2) primate somatosensory cortex recordings during a\nreaching task, and (3) biological neurons in the DishBrain platform interacting\nwith a virtual game environment. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art\ndynamic embedding techniques, revealing previously unreported relationships\nbetween adaptive behavior and the evolving topological organization of neural\nnetworks. These findings demonstrate that TAVRNN offers a powerful and\ngeneralizable approach for modeling neural dynamics across experimental and\nsynthetic biological systems.
