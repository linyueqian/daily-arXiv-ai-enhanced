Most previous research on HTC has focused on\nsupervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC\ncan be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces\nissues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we\npresent Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification\n(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by\nintegrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide\nstructured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves\nrelevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to\nunderstand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on\nthree open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental\nresults show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the\nstrict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at\ndeeper levels of the hierarchy.

We present the Continuous Thought\nMachine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core\nrepresentation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal\nprocessing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a\nhistory of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a\nlatent representation.

In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the\ntheoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust\nmanner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques,\nsuch as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well\nas hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of\nalgorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering\ntruly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows."}

The model was constructed\nusing NetLogo 6.3.0, and data from a survey questionnaire collected three data\npoints from BACOFA members. Five cases were explored, with each scenario\nsimulated 1000 times. Findings suggest that producers often sell to the market\nrather than the cooperative due to higher prices.

The producer's risk attitude significantly influences their\ndecision-making, affecting performance outcomes such as loans, demand, and\nprice changes. All three factors play a role and exert varying impacts on the\nvalue chain. So, the stakeholders' decisions on prioritizing factors in\nimproving relationships depend on their priorities.

Supervised\nlearning based denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance but\nrequire high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) labels, which are often unavailable.\nSelf-supervised learning holds promise to address the label scarcity issue, but\nexisting self-supervised denoising methods tend to oversmooth fine spatial\nfeatures and often yield inferior performance than supervised methods. We\nintroduce Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework\nfor MRI denoising. At the core of C2S is a generalized denoising score matching\n(GDSM) loss, which extends denoising score matching to work directly with noisy\nobservations by modeling the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given\nfurther corrupted observations. This allows the model to effectively learn\ndenoising across multiple noise levels directly from noisy data. Additionally,\nwe incorporate a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize training and\nenhance convergence, and introduce a detail refinement extension to balance\nnoise reduction with the preservation of fine spatial features. Moreover, C2S\ncan be extended to multi-contrast denoising by leveraging complementary\ninformation across different MRI contrasts.

Within each block we\nfirst coarsely create components, then precisely bind attributes via\ntarget-region localization and corresponding 3D Gaussian kernel optimization.\nBetween blocks, we introduce Gaussian Extension and Label Elimination to\nseamlessly generate new parts by extending new Gaussian kernels, re-assigning\nsemantic labels, and eliminating unnecessary kernels, ensuring that only\nrelevant parts are added without disrupting previously optimized parts.\nExperiments confirm that HCoG yields structurally coherent, attribute-faithful\n3D objects with complex attributes.

To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid\nlearning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised\nand supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.\n  Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the\nfirst stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images\nfrom noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as\npseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to\nrefine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates. We\nevaluated hybrid learning in two representative applications: (1) accelerated\n0.55T spiral-UTE lung MRI using noisy reference data, and (2) 3D T1 mapping of\nthe brain without access to fully sampled ground truth.\n  Results: For spiral-UTE lung MRI, hybrid learning consistently improved image\nquality over both self-supervised and conventional supervised methods across\ndifferent acceleration rates, as measured by SSIM and NMSE. For 3D T1 mapping,\nhybrid learning achieved superior T1 quantification accuracy across a wide\ndynamic range, outperforming self-supervised learning in all tested conditions.\n  Conclusions: Hybrid learning provides a practical and effective solution for\ntraining deep MRI reconstruction networks when only low-quality or incomplete\nreference data are available.

First,\nwe explored the geometry of complex words in semantic space. To do so, we\nconducted a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering analysis on\n4,226 Malay prefixed words. Several clusters were observed for complex words\nvaried by their prefix class. Then, we derived five simple measures, and\ninvestigated whether they were significant predictors of lexical decision\nlatencies. Two sets of Linear Discriminant Analyses were run in which the\nprefix of a word is predicted from either word embeddings or shift vectors\n(i.e., a vector subtraction of the base word from the derived word). The\naccuracy with which the model predicts the prefix of a word indicates the\ndegree of transparency of the prefix. Three further measures were obtained by\ncomparing embeddings between each word and all other words containing the same\nprefix (i.e., centroid), between each word and the shift from their base word,\nand between each word and the predicted word of the Functional Representations\nof Affixes in Compositional Semantic Space model.

These embedding tables can be pre-trained, but also\nlearned end-to-end jointly with the model to directly optimize the model\nobjectives. Training these large tables is challenging due to: gradient\nsparsity, the high cardinality of the categorical features, the non-uniform\ndistribution of IDs and the very high label sparsity. These issues make\ntraining prone to both slow convergence and overfitting after the first epoch.\nPrevious works addressed the multi-epoch overfitting issue by using: stronger\nfeature hashing to reduce cardinality, filtering of low frequency IDs,\nregularization of the embedding tables, re-initialization of the embedding\ntables after each epoch, etc. Some of these techniques reduce overfitting at\nthe expense of reduced model performance if used too aggressively.

However, the effectiveness of\nsupervised lip segmentation is constrained by the availability of lip contour\nin the training phase. A further challenge with lip segmentation is its\nreliance on image quality , lighting, and skin tone, leading to inaccuracies in\nthe detected boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a sequential\nlip segmentation method that integrates attention UNet and multidimensional\ninput. We unravel the micro-patterns in facial images using local binary\npatterns to build multidimensional inputs. Subsequently, the multidimensional\ninputs are fed into sequential attention UNets, where the lip contour is\nreconstructed. We introduce a mask generation method that uses a few anatomical\nlandmarks and estimates the complete lip contour to improve segmentation\naccuracy. This mask has been utilized in the training phase for lip\nsegmentation. To evaluate the proposed method, we use facial images to segment\nthe upper lips and subsequently assess lip-related facial anomalies in subjects\nwith fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Using the proposed lip segmentation method,\nwe achieved a mean dice score of 84.75%, and a mean pixel accuracy of 99.77% in\nupper lip segmentation. To further evaluate the method, we implemented\nclassifiers to identify those with FAS. Using a generative adversarial network\n(GAN), we reached an accuracy of 98.55% in identifying FAS in one of the study\npopulations. This method could be used to improve lip segmentation accuracy,\nespecially around Cupid's bow, and shed light on distinct lip-related\ncharacteristics of FAS."}

Additionally, we fine-tuned a\npre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using\nmammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%.\nCombining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation\ndemonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide\ngreater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the\nsensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1%\nsalt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise\n(e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods\noffer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of\ndiagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments."}

A systematic understanding of\ntheir relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact\nof the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns,\nlimitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature.

Conventional FL aggregates locally trained model weights into a\nglobal model, inherently constraining all sites to use a homogeneous model\narchitecture. This rigidity forces sites to compromise on architectures\ntailored to their compute resources and application-specific needs, making\nconventional FL unsuitable for model-heterogeneous settings where each site may\nprefer a distinct architecture. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nFedGAT, a novel model-agnostic FL technique based on generative autoregressive\ntransformers.

These patterns, referred to as ``regularity,'' enable the data-efficient\nlearning of generalizable manipulation skills. This dissertation offers a new\nperspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of\nregularity.

Second, we introduce methods that\nconstitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate\nmanipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations.

Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game\nbetween capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo\nscores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with\ntwo plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We\nvalidate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply\nit to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each\ngame, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on\ngeneral AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical\nstudy of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models\noversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the\nnext step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive\nnumerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight\nlevels to maximize the probability of oversight success. We also apply our\ntheory to our four oversight games, where we find that NSO success rates at a\ngeneral Elo gap of 400 are 13.5% for Mafia, 51.7% for Debate, 10.0% for\nBackdoor Code, and 9.4% for Wargames; these rates decline further when\noverseeing stronger systems."}

However, these\nprompt optimizing methods often struggle to tackle the target-unspecific or\ngeneralizable tasks effectively. It may be attributed to the fact that\noverfitting training causes the model to forget its general knowledge having\nstrong promotion on target-unspecific tasks. To alleviate this issue, we\npropose a novel Features Matrix (FM) regularization approach designed to\nenhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and\nleverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the\nFM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective,\npreserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of\noverfitting. Representative evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the FM is\ncompatible with existing frameworks as a generic and flexible module, and 2)\nthe FM significantly showcases its effectiveness in enhancing target-unspecific\ntasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

These\nnetworks can be optimized with supervised learning, if the target objective is\ndifferentiable. For many interesting problems, this is however not the case.\nCommon objectives like intersection over union (IoU), bilingual evaluation\nunderstudy (BLEU) score or rewards cannot be optimized with supervised\nlearning. A common workaround is to define differentiable surrogate losses,\nleading to suboptimal solutions with respect to the actual objective.\nReinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising alternative for\noptimizing deep neural networks to maximize non-differentiable objectives in\nrecent years. Examples include aligning large language models via human\nfeedback, code generation, object detection or control problems. This makes RL\ntechniques relevant to the larger machine learning audience. The subject is,\nhowever, time intensive to approach due to the large range of methods, as well\nas the often very theoretical presentation. In this introduction, we take an\nalternative approach, different from classic reinforcement learning textbooks.\nRather than focusing on tabular problems, we introduce reinforcement learning\nas a generalization of supervised learning, which we first apply to\nnon-differentiable objectives and later to temporal problems.

To gain a deeper understanding of this\nrelationship, an image space formalism of RAKI is introduced for analyzing\nnoise propagation analytically, identifying and characterizing image\nreconstruction features and to describe the role of nonlinear activations in a\nhuman readable manner. Methods: The image space formalism for RAKI inference is\nemployed by expressing nonlinear activations in k-space as element-wise\nmultiplications with activation masks, which transform into convolutions in\nimage space. Jacobians of the de-aliased, coil-combined image relative to the\naliased coil images can be expressed algebraically, and thus, the noise\namplification is quantified analytically (g-factor maps). We analyze the role\nof nonlinearity for noise resilience by controlling the degree of nonlinearity\nin the reconstruction model via the negative slope parameter in leaky ReLU.\nResults: The analytical g-factor maps correspond with those obtained from Monte\nCarlo simulations and from an auto differentiation approach for in vivo brain\nimages. Apparent blurring and contrast loss artifacts are identified as\nimplications of enhanced noise resilience. These residual artifacts can be\ntraded against noise resilience by adjusting the degree of nonlinearity in the\nmodel (Tikhonov-like regularization) in case of limited training data.

This trifecta of human\nthought has remained elusive in modern intelligent machines. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as\nappropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present\nthe Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in\nslots. At the core of NSI is a nested schema that uses simple syntax rules to\norganize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema primitives.\nThen, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through a\nstructured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal\nalignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task\ndemonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences\nlearned by NSI. From a scene representation standpoint, we find that emergent\nNSI slots that move beyond the image grid by binding to spatial objects\nfacilitate improved visual grounding compared to conventional\nbounding-box-based approaches. From a data efficiency standpoint, we\nempirically validate that NSI learns more generalizable representations from a\nfixed amount of annotation data than the traditional approach.

As an exemplary focus, we\ngeneralize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant\nGraphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to\nbounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of\norder $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish\nuniversal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This\nsignificantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a\nsubset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full\nIGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs\nalso aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating\ncomparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are\ndiscontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and\nis inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--transferability remains\nachievable."}

The current semantic communication systems are\ngenerally modeled as an Auto-Encoder (AE). AE lacks a deep integration of AI\nprinciples with communication strategies due to its inability to effectively\ncapture channel dynamics. This gap makes it difficult to justify the need for\njoint source-channel coding (JSCC) and to explain why performance improves.\nThis paper begins by exploring lossless and lossy communication, highlighting\nthat the inclusion of data distortion distinguishes semantic communication from\nclassical communication. It breaks the conditions for the separation theorem to\nhold and explains why the amount of data transferred by semantic communication\nis less. Therefore, employing JSCC becomes imperative for achieving optimal\nsemantic communication. Moreover, a Variational Source-Channel Coding (VSCC)\nmethod is proposed for constructing semantic communication systems based on\ndata distortion theory, integrating variational inference and channel\ncharacteristics. Using a deep learning network, we develop a semantic\ncommunication system employing the VSCC method and demonstrate its capability\nfor semantic transmission. We also establish semantic communication systems of\nequivalent complexity employing the AE method and the VAE method. Experimental\nresults reveal that the VSCC model offers superior interpretability compared to\nAE model, as it clearly captures the semantic features of the transmitted data,\nrepresented as the variance of latent variables in our experiments. In\naddition, VSCC model exhibits superior semantic transmission capabilities\ncompared to VAE model. At the same level of data distortion evaluated by PSNR,\nVSCC model exhibits stronger human interpretability, which can be partially\nassessed by SSIM."}

However, robust modeling of\nthese cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated\ntoy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate\nneural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging Standard Model\nsymmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We then perform a\nneutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that\nthe modeled cross section achieves results consistent with what could be\nobtained if the true cross section were known exactly. This proof-of-principle\nstudy highlights the potential of future neutrino near-detector datasets and\ndata-driven cross-section models."}

The kernel is built on with the observables of a\nquantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and\ntest data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional\nTheory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian\nparameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of\nmeasurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the\nmethod outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive\nwith the radial basis function method."}

Unlike raw scalp EEG-based models, SeizureFormer leverages\nstructured, clinically relevant features and integrates CNN-based patch\nembedding, multi-head self-attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks to\nmodel both short-term dynamics and long-term seizure cycles. Tested across five\npatients and multiple prediction windows (1 to 14 days), SeizureFormer achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance with mean ROC AUC of 79.44 percent and mean PR AUC\nof 76.29 percent. Compared to statistical, machine learning, and deep learning\nbaselines, it demonstrates enhanced generalizability and seizure risk\nforecasting performance under class imbalance.

Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL\ncommunication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities\nwithin sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated\nlearning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model\nupdate sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in\nsparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial\nscenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense\nstrategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while\nmaintaining communication efficiency."}
