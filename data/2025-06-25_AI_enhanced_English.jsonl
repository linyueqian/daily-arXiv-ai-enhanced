This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts.

We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\nhave been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated\nto clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the\nincreasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning\nguidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet\nbeen explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for\nultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for\nultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a\ntransformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object\ndetection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user\nquery is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through\nLLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding\nultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,\nassisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical\nexploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning\nguidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,\nincluding the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results\ndemonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by\nenhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a scene graph (SG) method for ultrasound images to improve interpretability and scanning guidance for non-experts, validated on neck region images.", "motivation": "Addressing the challenge of medical ultrasound interpretability and the unmet need for basic scanning guidance for non-expert users, especially in point-of-care settings.", "method": "Uses a transformer-based one-stage method to compute ultrasound SGs, refined by LLMs for user queries, and explores SGs for scanning guidance.", "result": "Validated on neck region images, showing potential to democratize ultrasound by enhancing interpretability and usability for non-experts.", "conclusion": "The SG-based approach effectively improves ultrasound interpretability and scanning guidance for non-expert users."}}
