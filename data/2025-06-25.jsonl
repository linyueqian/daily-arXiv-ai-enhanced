Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods\nhave been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing\nsurveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For\none thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such\nas 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other\nrelated tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most\nsurveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,\nwhile lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as\nmulti-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope\nto organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are\nreported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the\nbackground of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.\nA step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we\nalso investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open\nchallenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help\nresearchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible\ninsights for future research."}

In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary\ngame model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on\nevolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government\nregulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against\nthe online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most\ndesirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was\nintroduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors\nwere considered alongside game strategies.

The game's complexity masks this property from\nuntrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt\nstyles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament\ngameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to\nrandomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of\nprompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit\nhints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to\nexploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through\nwin/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful\nvariation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities\nfor improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our\nimplementation publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full\nreproducibility."}

This paper investigates\nharmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for\nspeech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in\ntwo steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs\nis already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively\naggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at\nnon-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation\n(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus\nF0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,\nour method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying\nperiodicity of FFRs.

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties.

This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

Although segment-wise approaches have obtained\npromising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational\ninefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated\nshapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our\nmethod leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,\ncomputing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.\nThis strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to\nincomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular\nstructure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method\neffectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence\nwithout depending on extensive prior structural knowledge."}

In recent years,\nimages have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image\nrecognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image\ncompression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many\nexisting models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image\ncompression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully\ndesigning the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant\non their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently\nconsidered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and\ninterpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual\ncompression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding\nmethods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:\nFeature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based\nScalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various\nmachine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between\nencoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse\napplication requirements.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost\nalways higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and\ngeneralization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to\nbecome a standard graph data preprocessing method."}

This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables.

To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a\nrobust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and\ncontext-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages\nstructured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object\nrepresentation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,\ncontext-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training\ninstances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental\ncontexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an\nexpert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared\nto baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional\nwildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability.

Unlike\n[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold\nfor the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model\npersonalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of\nusers' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).\nAdditionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term\nin [JRS+21] by a factor of $\\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary\nclassification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to\nprivately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy\nguarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the\nshared embedding and the users' data.

Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient\nreasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative\nto ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading\neffective supervision."}

While these representations can include\ncycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete\nfor identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the\nassumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world\nsystems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To\naccount for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been\nintroduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce\nanother type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).\nAnalogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level\nrepresentations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,\nwe prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally\nsound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.\nFurthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of\nmacro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends\nto a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs."}

We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time.

We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions.

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment.

Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The\nmanual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours\nper disease.

To address this, we propose a novel method called\nProgressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the\nhigh-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a\nquadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from\nglobal patterns to local details.

We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings\nhighlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online\ncommunal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in\ncommunal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming\nto refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact."}

Gradient integration is a building block in\nthe attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived\nsamples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a\nbuilding block often combines with other information from visual models such as\nactivation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the\nsample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image\ndistribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add\nnoise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low\nexplanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra\ninformation can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy\nattribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment\nproblem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a\nsemi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample\ndistribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the\ndistribution of natural images.

In this work, we\nintroduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks\n(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from\nthe parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the\ninferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network.

In this paper, we challenge the current\npractice of considering LLM-generated text detection a binary classification\ntask of differentiating human from AI. Instead, we introduce a novel ternary\ntext classification scheme, adding an \"undecided\" category for texts that could\nbe attributed to either source, and we show that this new category is crucial\nto understand how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users.\nThis research shifts the paradigm from merely classifying to explaining\nmachine-generated texts, emphasizing need for detectors to provide clear and\nunderstandable explanations to users. Our study involves creating four new\ndatasets comprised of texts from various LLMs and human authors. Based on new\ndatasets, we performed binary classification tests to ascertain the most\neffective SOTA detection methods and identified SOTA LLMs capable of producing\nharder-to-detect texts. We constructed a new dataset of texts generated by two\ntop-performing LLMs and human authors, and asked three human annotators to\nproduce ternary labels with explanation notes. This dataset was used to\ninvestigate how three top-performing SOTA detectors behave in new ternary\nclassification context. Our results highlight why \"undecided\" category is much\nneeded from the viewpoint of explainability. Additionally, we conducted an\nanalysis of explainability of the three best-performing detectors and the\nexplanation notes of the human annotators, revealing insights about the\ncomplexity of explainable detection of machine-generated texts.

In this paper, we first build a\nbridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms\ntheoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We\ndraw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the\nstate-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the\ndistribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap\nbetween the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.\nSecondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies\ntrained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the\nperformance gap.

Collage allows the use and\nevaluation of any HuggingFace token classifier, several LLMs, and multiple\nother task-specific models out of the box, and provides extensible software\ninterfaces to accelerate experimentation with new models. Further, we enable\nboth developers and users of NLP-based tools to inspect, debug, and better\nunderstand modeling pipelines by providing granular views of intermediate\nstates of processing.

The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right\ninput: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential\npatterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature\nTransformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational\nanalysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes\nof input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to\nlearn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by\nemphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The\nresult is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances\ntraining stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are\nprojected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes\nof plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural\nnetworks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on\nMNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification\naccuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's\nsuperiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training\nstability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness.

AMBer selects symmetry groups,\nparticle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable\nmodels while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate\nour approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration\nto a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the\ncontext of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning\nwith physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical\nmodel-building problems in the future."}

We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.

Unlike\ntraditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each\ntoken depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency\nmakes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can\nsignificantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with\nlookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces\nthe residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the\nmessage-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain\ntoken packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a\nlookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates\nwithout replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates\nsampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.\nExperiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned\nimages) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores\ncomparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up\nto 40$\\times$.

MagicPose4D comprises two key modules: (i) Dual-Phase 4D\nReconstruction Module, which operates in two phases. The first phase focuses on\ncapturing the model's shape using accurate 2D supervision and less accurate but\ngeometrically informative 3D pseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton\nconstraints.

To enhance\ncontrol, we present ObjCtrl-2.5D, a training-free object control approach that\nuses a 3D trajectory, extended from a 2D trajectory with depth information, as\na control signal. By modeling object movement as camera movement, ObjCtrl-2.5D\nrepresents the 3D trajectory as a sequence of camera poses, enabling object\nmotion control using an existing camera motion control I2V generation model\n(CMC-I2V) without training. To adapt the CMC-I2V model originally designed for\nglobal motion control to handle local object motion, we introduce a module to\nisolate the target object from the background, enabling independent local\ncontrol. In addition, we devise an effective way to achieve more accurate\nobject control by sharing low-frequency warped latent within the object's\nregion across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjCtrl-2.5D\nsignificantly improves object control accuracy compared to training-free\nmethods and offers more diverse control capabilities than training-based\napproaches using 2D trajectories, enabling complex effects like object\nrotation.

In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed\nsamples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in\nresponse to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that\ndynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,\nrefining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the\ndirection of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual\nspace, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on\nunintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two\npre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for\nImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across\nvarious models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc."}

While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when\ntraining GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a\nproxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be\ntrusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS\nevolves over training.

Our findings about how the CBS changes over\ntraining motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language\nmodels at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the\nCBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to\nslightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient\nsteps.

This technique prioritizes recent data while\npreserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process\ndynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the\nimportance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining\nhistorical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations\nbut also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one\nof the use cases."}

The\nmodel integrates a learnable component that predicts robot-terrain interaction\nforces with a neural-symbolic layer that enforces the laws of classical\nmechanics and consequently improves generalization on out-of-distribution data.\nThe neural-symbolic layer includes a differentiable physics engine that\ncomputes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of\ncontact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial\ngeometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a\nlearnable physics engine conditioned on real sensor data that delivers $10^4$\ntrajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this\narchitecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution\nsensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation\nspeed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model\npredictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning,\nor SLAM."}

However, despite the above examples and later extensions\nthereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly\noptimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of\nother multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often\nregarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a\npractical tool for solving decision-making problems.\n  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be\nfruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven\nintroduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of\nproblems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent\nperformance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the\nGittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to\nminimizing tail latency in queues."}

A custom dataset comprising 500\nannotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from\nthe Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five\npredefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally,\nthe publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training\ndata. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and\ntrained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom\ndataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was\nachieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical\ncharacter recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using\nboth Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results.\nSubsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a\nResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses:\nDecorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection.\nFurthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of\nillustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the\nanalysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further\nadvancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation."}

This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR\nestimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where\nregularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage\nCMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate\nguarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the\nDML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)\nframework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal\nconvergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity\nconditions, where $N$ is the sample size.
