Traditional control methods, such as reachability and\ncontrol barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when\ninteractions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts\nbetween the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe\nmulti-agent coordination.\n  To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple\nlayers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to\nlearn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple\nindicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to\nresult in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for\nagents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the\nmost urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides\ntactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design\ndecisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability\nanalysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism.\n  We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using\nCrazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation\nscenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding\ncollisions. The results show that our method significantly reduces conflict\nwhile maintaining safety without sacrificing much efficiency (i.e., shorter\ntravel time and distance) compared to baselines that do not incorporate layered\nsafety.

This paper comprehensively\ninvestigates audio-visual attention in ODVs from both subjective and objective\nperspectives. Specifically, we first introduce a new audio-visual saliency\ndatabase for omnidirectional videos, termed AVS-ODV database, containing 162\nODVs and corresponding eye movement data collected from 60 subjects under three\naudio modes including mute, mono, and ambisonics. Based on the constructed\nAVS-ODV database, we perform an in-depth analysis of how audio influences\nvisual attention in ODVs. To advance the research on audio-visual saliency\nprediction for ODVs, we further establish a new benchmark based on the AVS-ODV\ndatabase by testing numerous state-of-the-art saliency models, including\nvisual-only models and audio-visual models. In addition, given the limitations\nof current models, we propose an innovative omnidirectional audio-visual\nsaliency prediction network (OmniAVS), which is built based on the U-Net\narchitecture, and hierarchically fuses audio and visual features from the\nmultimodal aligned embedding space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed OmniAVS model outperforms other state-of-the-art models on\nboth ODV AVS prediction and traditional AVS predcition tasks. The AVS-ODV\ndatabase and OmniAVS model will be released to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a new audio-visual saliency database (AVS-ODV) for omnidirectional videos and proposes an advanced saliency prediction model (OmniAVS) that outperforms existing methods.", "motivation": "Enhancing user engagement in VR/AR by understanding and predicting viewer attention in ODVs, addressing the lack of large-scale audio-visual saliency databases and joint modality exploitation.", "method": "Creation of the AVS-ODV database with 162 ODVs and eye-tracking data from 60 subjects under three audio modes.

To address the convergence of HMC for the BPINN method and extend\nits application scope to multi-scale partial differential equations (PDE), we\ndevelop a robust multi-scale BPINN (dubbed MBPINN) method by integrating\nmulti-scale deep neural networks (MscaleDNN) and the BPINN framework. In this\nnewly proposed MBPINN method, we reframe HMC with Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(SGD) to ensure the most ``likely'' estimation is always provided, and we\nconfigure its solver as a Fourier feature mapping-induced MscaleDNN. This novel\nmethod offers several key advantages: (1) it is more robust than HMC, (2) it\nincurs less computational cost than HMC, and (3) it is more flexible for\ncomplex problems. We demonstrate the applicability and performance of the\nproposed method through some general Poisson and multi-scale elliptic problems\nin one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Our findings indicate that the\nproposed method can avoid HMC failures and provide valid results. Additionally,\nour method is capable of handling complex elliptic PDE and producing comparable\nresults for general elliptic PDE under the case of lower signal-to-noise rate.\nThese findings suggest that our proposed approach has great potential for\nphysics-informed machine learning for parameter estimation and solution\nrecovery in the case of ill-posed problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a robust multi-scale BPINN (MBPINN) method to improve Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) convergence in Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) for solving multi-scale PDEs.", "motivation": "HMC in BPINN often performs poorly and converges inadequately for given step sizes, limiting its practicality for multi-scale PDEs.", "method": "MBPINN integrates multi-scale deep neural networks (MscaleDNN) and BPINN, reframing HMC with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and using Fourier feature mapping-induced MscaleDNN.", "result": "MBPINN outperforms HMC in robustness, computational cost, and flexibility, successfully solving Poisson and multi-scale elliptic problems in 1D/2D spaces.", "conclusion": "MBPINN shows promise for physics-informed machine learning, especially for ill-posed problems in parameter estimation and solution recovery."}}

We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact\nfunctions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a\nneural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale\nevent sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than\ntraditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches,\nand allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding\ntransformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings.\nResults show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in\nsimulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset,\nand gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children\ndiagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our\nflexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics\nin EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be\nmaintained without loss of performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a neural network-based Hawkes process with a flexible impact kernel in event embedding space, balancing interpretability and performance for modeling EHRs.", "motivation": "To address the tradeoff between flexibility and interpretability in neural network-based Hawkes processes for healthcare applications.", "method": "A novel HP formulation using a neural network-based impact kernel in event embedding space, optionally enhanced with transformer layers.", "result": "Accurate impact function recovery in simulations, competitive performance on MIMIC-IV, and meaningful clinical interpretations on XX-EHR.", "conclusion": "The flexible impact kernel effectively captures self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs, maintaining interpretability without sacrificing performance."}}
