However, existing process\nformalisms fall short to combine key modeling features, such as tracking object\nidentities, supporting complex datatypes, handling dependencies among them, and\nobject-aware synchronization. Object-centric Petri nets with identifiers\n(OPIDs) partially address these needs but treat objects as unstructured\nidentifiers (e.g., order and item IDs), overlooking the rich semantics of\ncomplex data values (e.g., item prices or other attributes). To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce data-aware OPIDs (DOPIDs), a framework that strictly\nextends OPIDs by incorporating structured data manipulation capabilities, and\nfull synchronization mechanisms. In spite of the expressiveness of the model,\nwe show that it can be made operational: Specifically, we define a novel\nconformance checking approach leveraging satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)\nto compute data-aware object-centric alignments."}

Traditional solutions assume the mediator can access\nagents utility function values and gradients. However, there is an increasing\nnumber of settings, such as human AI interactions, where utility values may be\ninaccessible or incomparable due to unknown, nonaffine transformations. To\nmodel such settings, we consider that the mediator has access only to agents\nmost preferred directions, i.e., normalized utility gradients in the decision\nspace. To this end, we propose a cooperative bargaining algorithm where a\nmediator has access to only the direction oracle of each agent. We prove that\nunlike popular approaches such as the Nash and Kalai Smorodinsky bargaining\nsolutions, our approach is invariant to monotonic nonaffine transformations,\nand that under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, this approach\nenjoys global asymptotic convergence to Pareto stationary solutions. Moreover,\nwe show that the bargaining solutions found by our algorithm also satisfy the\naxioms of symmetry and (under slightly stronger conditions) independence of\nirrelevant alternatives, which are popular in the literature.

Additionally, we observe that current MDD methods impose\nasymmetric supervision across modalities, resulting in biased optimization. To\naddress this, we propose symmetric projection trajectory matching, which\nsynchronizes the optimization dynamics using modality-specific projection\nheads, thereby promoting balanced supervision and enhancing cross-modal\nalignment. Experiments on Flickr-30K and MS-COCO show that RepBlend\nconsistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art MDD methods, achieving\nsignificant gains in retrieval performance (e.g., +9.4 IR@10, +6.3 TR@10 under\nthe 100-pair setting) and offering up to 6.7$\\times$ distillation speedup."}

Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural\nNetwork (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal\ncorrelations.

Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate\nhistory into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal\nsimilarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate\nforecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term\nMultivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting.\nSpecifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively\nencode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and\nreduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation\nRetriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the\nlong-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable\nrepresentations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator\n(TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual\nrepresentations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72%\non the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on\nseveral real-world datasets.

Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given\ntheir established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing\nmethods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward\nRL in episodic settings, with periodic resets. This setup misaligns with the\nsemantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over\ninfinite behavior traces. In such cases, the average reward criterion and the\ncontinuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a\nsingle, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.\n  To address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on\nabsolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that\ncannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to\nthe continuing setting. We present the first model-free RL framework that\ntranslates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives. Our\napproach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting. We\nalso introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective\noptimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the\npolicies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given\nomega-regular specification. Our method guarantees convergence in unknown\ncommunicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full\nknowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL. Empirical results\nshow our average-reward approach in continuing setting outperforms\ndiscount-based methods across benchmarks."}

We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural\ntheory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness,\nnorm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate\n21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models.\nResults reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model\nachieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some\nopen-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably\nshort of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning\ncapacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To\nimprove model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised\nfine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning\nwith contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors.\nThese methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and\ncompliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with\nminimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks."}

In order to meet this demand, researchers\nare now investigating novel forms of data storage media. The high density, long\nlifespan and low energy needs of synthetic DNA make it a promising candidate\nfor long-term data archival. However, current DNA data storage technologies are\nfacing challenges with respect to cost (writing data to DNA is expensive) and\nreliability (reading and writing data is error prone). Thus, data compression\nand error correction are crucial to scale DNA storage. Additionally, the DNA\nmolecules encoding several files are very often stored in the same place,\ncalled an oligo pool. For this reason, without random access solutions, it is\nrelatively impractical to decode a specific file from the pool, because all the\noligos from all the files need to first be sequenced, which greatly\ndeteriorates the read cost. This paper introduces PIC-DNA - a novel\nJPEG2000-based progressive image coder adapted to DNA data storage. This coder\ndirectly includes a random access process in its coding system, allowing for\nthe retrieval of a specific image from a pool of oligos encoding several\nimages.

While Neural Code Models (NCMs) show\nstrong performance in automating software tasks, their lack of transparency in\ncausal relationships between inputs and outputs limits full understanding of\ntheir capabilities. To build trust in NCMs, researchers and practitioners must\nexplain code predictions. Associational interpretability, which identifies\ncorrelations, is often insufficient for tasks requiring intervention and change\nanalysis. To address this, the dissertation introduces DoCode, a novel post hoc\ninterpretability method for NCMs. DoCode uses causal inference to provide\nprogramming language-oriented explanations of model predictions. It follows a\nfour-step pipeline: modeling causal problems using Structural Causal Models\n(SCMs), identifying the causal estimand, estimating effects with metrics like\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE), and refuting effect estimates. Its framework is\nextensible, with an example that reduces spurious correlations by grounding\nexplanations in programming language properties. A case study on deep code\ngeneration across interpretability scenarios and various deep learning\narchitectures demonstrates DoCode's benefits. Results show NCMs' sensitivity to\ncode syntax changes and their ability to learn certain programming concepts\nwhile minimizing confounding bias. The dissertation also examines associational\ninterpretability as a foundation, analyzing software information's causal\nnature using tools like COMET and TraceXplainer for traceability. It highlights\nthe need to identify code confounders and offers practical guidelines for\napplying causal interpretability to NCMs, contributing to more trustworthy AI\nin software engineering."}

Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator.

This generative RL-trained\nverifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to\ndeterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual\nreinforcement with the generator.

By cutting the parts that have little effect on the\ncomputation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation\ncomputation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient\nvariance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention\nmechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention\nbecomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically\nwith sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very\nsmall, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small\nfraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising\ntargets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical\ntransformer model, cutting $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing\n$c \\sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about\n$1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$.

To address this, in\nthis work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd\nwhich could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve\nthis, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K\nstep-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains\nand difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first\nmeta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe\nthat our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to\nusing GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by\nusing GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve\n10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini\nas the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK."}

We propose a\nSqueeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in\nMIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core\ncomponents: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that\nreduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature\nlearning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric\nstructure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization\nobjective for the SP.

This decomposed\nattention, referred to as Long Short-attention (LS-attention), mitigates logit\nexplosion and results in more stable training compared to an equivalent\nmulti-head self-attention (MHSA). Empirical comparisons with two alternative\ntraining stabilization methods show that LS-attention reduces the validation\nperplexity to nearly 2/5 of that achieved by one method and reaches a similar\nperplexity as the other method using only 1/20 of the GPU hours.

In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of\ncapture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model\nperformance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and\nvisual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common\nvision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\\textbf{S}$hutter speed,\nISO se$\\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of\nobjects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled\ncamera settings.

Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone\n(i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves\nDatabase 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning\ncurves, we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than\npreviously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe\nsignificant ill-behavior in approximately 14% of the learning curves, almost\ntwice as much as in previous estimates.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel\nframework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance\n(\"thought patterns\"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during\ntraining, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external\nguidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva\nMath. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500\nprior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models.

Current reasoning\nmodels, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human\nlanguage, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in\nthe semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and\nupper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration\nof reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling\none token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free\nmethod that emulates human-like \"soft\" reasoning by generating soft, abstract\nconcept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created\nby the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the\ncontinuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer\nrepresentations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,\neach generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related\ndiscrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge\neffectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse\nmathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points\nwhile simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard\nCoT.

Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes\nnecessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain\nnarrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend\non each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a\ncurriculum which substantially accelerates learning.

We address this bottleneck by\nproposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising\nprocess of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different\ntokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process.\nAccordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and\nvalue states.

Besides, existing\nmethods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper\nwe propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model\ncompression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck\ntheory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each\nother.

While refusal responses can be viewed\nas evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research\nsuggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated\nassessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and\ntraining. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used\nto evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking\nand fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess\nrefusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot\nArena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how\ndifferent types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which\nexplicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., \"I can't help with that\nbecause it may be harmful\"), and technical refusals, which reflect system\nlimitations (e.g., \"I can't answer because I lack real-time data\"). We find\nthat LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more\nfavorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.\nWe refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for\nmodel-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.\nThis raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the\nnormative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems."}

Here,\ninitiating IDS requires complete reception of a CAN message from the\ncontroller, incurring data movement and software overheads. In this paper, we\npresent SecCAN, a novel CAN controller architecture that embeds IDS capability\nwithin the datapath of the controller. This integration allows IDS to tap\nmessages directly from within the CAN controller as they are received from the\nbus, removing overheads incurred by existing ML-based IDSs. A custom-quantised\nmachine-learning accelerator is developed as the IDS engine and embedded into\nSecCAN's receive data path, with optimisations to overlap the IDS inference\nwith the protocol's reception window. We implement SecCAN on AMD XCZU7EV FPGA\nto quantify its performance and benefits in hardware, using multiple attack\ndatasets. We show that SecCAN can completely hide the IDS latency within the\nCAN reception window for all CAN packet sizes and detect multiple attacks with\nstate-of-the-art accuracy with zero software overheads on the ECU and low\nenergy overhead (73.7 uJ per message) for IDS inference. Also, SecCAN incurs\nlimited resource overhead compared to a standard CAN controller (< 30% LUT, <\n1% FF), making it ideally suited for automotive deployment."}

Previous works studied if LLMs\nlearned the same features, which are internal representations that activate on\nspecific concepts. Since comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to\npolysemanticity, in which LLM neurons often correspond to multiple unrelated\nfeatures rather than to distinct concepts, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been\nemployed to disentangle LLM neurons into SAE features corresponding to distinct\nconcepts.

Evidence for\nthis hypothesis would imply that interpretability techniques related to latent\nspaces, such as steering vectors, may be transferred across models via certain\ntransformations.

By doing so, it\nreveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We\napply LAMP to three tasks: sentiment analysis, controversial-topic detection,\nand safety-prompt auditing. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs\nexhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces\ncorrelate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical\ncase-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without\nrequiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves\nas a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language\nmodels, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with\nthe explanations it provides."}

We aim to find an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the\nlong-term \\textit{state-dependent} costs of estimation errors under a\ntransmission frequency constraint. The optimal scheduling problem is formulated\nas a \\emph{constrained Markov decision process} (CMDP). We show that the\noptimal Lagrangian cost follows a piece-wise linear and concave (PWLC)\nfunction, and the optimal policy is, at most, a randomized mixture of two\nsimple deterministic policies.

Rather than updating the full model during local\ntraining, ProFL partitions the model into blocks based on its original\narchitecture and trains each block in a progressive fashion. It first trains\nthe front blocks and safely freezes them after convergence. Training of the\nnext block is then triggered. This process progressively grows the model to be\ntrained until the training of the full model is completed. In this way, the\npeak memory footprint is effectively reduced for feasible deployment on\nheterogeneous devices. In order to preserve the feature representation of each\nblock, the training process is divided into two stages: model shrinking and\nmodel growing. During the model shrinking stage, we meticulously design\ncorresponding output modules to assist each block in learning the expected\nfeature representation and obtain the initialization model parameters.\nSubsequently, the obtained output modules and initialization model parameters\nare utilized in the corresponding model growing stage, which progressively\ntrains the full model.

Most existing OPE/OPL methods--based on importance weighting or\nimputation--assume common support between the target and logging policies. When\nthis assumption is violated, these methods typically require unstable\nextrapolation, truncation, or conservative strategies for individuals outside\nthe common support assumption. However, such approaches can be inadequate in\nsettings where explicit evaluation or optimization for such individuals is\nrequired. To address this issue, we propose DOLCE: Decomposing Off-policy\nevaluation/learning into Lagged and Current Effects, a novel estimator that\nleverages contextual information from multiple time points to decompose rewards\ninto lagged and current effects. By incorporating both past and present\ncontexts, DOLCE effectively handles individuals who violate the common support\nassumption. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under two\nassumptions--local correctness and conditional independence. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that DOLCE achieves substantial improvements in OPE and OPL,\nparticularly as the proportion of individuals outside the common support\nassumption increases."}

However, existing\noffloaded training frameworks like ZeRO-Offload treat all parameters equally\nand update the full model on the CPU, causing severe GPU stalls, where fast,\nexpensive GPUs sit idle waiting for slow CPU updates and limited-bandwidth PCIe\ntransfers. We present ZenFlow, a new offloading framework that prioritizes\nimportant parameters and decouples updates between GPU and CPU. ZenFlow\nperforms in-place updates of important gradients on GPU, while asynchronously\noffloading and accumulating less important ones on CPU, fully overlapping CPU\nwork with GPU computation. To scale across GPUs, ZenFlow introduces a\nlightweight gradient selection method that exploits a novel spatial and\ntemporal locality property of important gradients, avoiding costly global\nsynchronization. ZenFlow achieves up to 5x end-to-end speedup, 2x lower PCIe\ntraffic, and reduces GPU stalls by over 85 percent, all while preserving\naccuracy."}

Most models with hierarchical structures or latent variables are\nsingular, for which conventional criteria such as the Akaike Information\nCriterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are inapplicable due to the\nbreakdown of normal approximations for the likelihood and posterior. To address\nthis, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely\nApplicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) have been proposed. Since WAIC\nand WBIC are computed using posterior distributions at different temperature\nsettings, separate posterior sampling is generally required. In this paper, we\ntheoretically derive an asymptotic equation that links WAIC and WBIC, despite\ntheir dependence on different posteriors. This equation yields an\nasymptotically unbiased expression of WAIC in terms of the posterior\ndistribution used for WBIC. The result clarifies the structural relationship\nbetween these criteria within the framework of singular learning theory, and\ndeepens understanding of their asymptotic behavior. This theoretical\ncontribution provides a foundation for future developments in the computational\nefficiency of model selection in singular models."}
