Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may\ndisappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object\nmotion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities.\nSecondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it\nsusceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion,\ndue to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these\nproblems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate\nobject motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory.\nFirstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object\nmotion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a\nset of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards\nthe direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities.\nFurthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we\ndevise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically\nidentifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and\nframe-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from\nmemory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar\nregions for improving segmentation results.

The agent must accurately locate the target based on visual\ninformation from the environment and complete tasks through interaction with\nthe surroundings. Despite significant advancements in this field, two major\nlimitations persist: (1) Many existing methods input complete language\ninstructions directly into multi-layer Transformer networks without fully\nexploiting the detailed information within the instructions, thereby limiting\nthe agent's language understanding capabilities during task execution; (2)\nCurrent approaches often overlook the modeling of object relationships across\ndifferent modalities, failing to effectively utilize latent clues between\nobjects, which affects the accuracy and robustness of navigation decisions. We\npropose a Dual Object Perception-Enhancement Network (DOPE) to address these\nissues to improve navigation performance. First, we design a Text Semantic\nExtraction (TSE) to extract relatively essential phrases from the text and\ninput them into the Text Object Perception-Augmentation (TOPA) to fully\nleverage details such as objects and actions within the instructions. Second,\nwe introduce an Image Object Perception-Augmentation (IOPA), which performs\nadditional modeling of object information across different modalities, enabling\nthe model to more effectively utilize latent clues between objects in images\nand text, enhancing decision-making accuracy. Extensive experiments on the R2R\nand REVERIE datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed approach."}

Initial testing of 21 LLMs, revealed GPT-4o and neural\nchat to have the most potential to scale-up DA in the language learning\nclassroom. Further testing of these two candidates found both models performed\nsimilarly in their ability to accurately identify grammatical errors in user\nsentences. However, GPT-4o consistently outperformed neural chat in the quality\nof its DA by generating clear, consistent, and progressively explicit hints.\nReal-time responsiveness and system stability were also confirmed through\ndetailed performance testing, with GPT-4o exhibiting sufficient speed and\nstability. This study shows that LLMs can be used to scale-up dynamic\nassessment and thus enable dynamic assessment to be delivered to larger groups\nthan possible in traditional teacher-learner settings."}

This challenge arises primarily\nfrom two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text\ngeneration are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively\nmitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as\nsemantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can\naccurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to\nconsider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This\nphenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate\nwords and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising\nthe semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and\ndiminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm,\ncharacter-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding\nalgorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's\nproperties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's\nproperties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate\nwords in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the\ncharacter level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while\nreducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the\ncandidate pool.

Essentially, EAX employs a two-stage mechanism\nthat focuses on improving the current solutions, first, at the local and,\nsubsequently, at the global level. Although the second phase of the algorithm\nhas been thoroughly studied, configured, and refined in the past, in\nparticular, its first stage has hardly been examined.\n  In this paper, we thus focus on the first stage of EAX and introduce a novel\nmethod that quickly verifies whether the AB-cycles, generated during its\ninternal optimization procedure, yield valid tours -- or whether they need to\nbe repaired. Knowledge of the latter is also particularly relevant before\napplying other powerful crossover operators such as the Generalized Partition\nCrossover (GPX). Based on our insights, we propose and evaluate several\nimproved versions of EAX.

Prior methods of\nassessing the fix condition rely on counterfactuals inferred from a Structural\nCausal Model (SCM) trained on historical data.

Our findings reveal\nan inverse relationship: models with higher technical accuracy often show lower\nagreement with human experts, while LLMs demonstrate stronger expert alignment\ndespite lower accuracy. We use Cohen's Kappa and Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to quantify and visualize model-expert agreement, and employ SHAP\nanalysis to explain misclassifications.

Due to\nthe lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the\npixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to\nthe frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum\nand phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by\nadversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This\nmeans that we can extract the content and structural information of the\noriginal clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged.\nMeanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods\nindiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage\nto the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate\nadversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and\nstructure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the\nreverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency\ncomponents of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding\nparts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of\nthe estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase\nspectrum, focusing on the low frequencies.

We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns\nthis representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data.\nFirst, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically\nextracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a\nrobust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently\nadapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations\nprocessed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline.

To validate it, we conduct\nexperiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final\ndesigns and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast,\na metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger\ncorrelation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based\nmodel that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising\ndesigns based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error\non ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than\ntwenty existing methods."}

In this paper, we introduce a\nunifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by\nthe empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve\ncontextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step\nprocess, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression\nproblem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via\n``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including\nlinear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners,\nand softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices:\nthe regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time\noptimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to\ncapture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for\nthe empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention.\nFurther, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we\nuse to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond\nunification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression\nmethods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more\npowerful and theoretically principled architectures."}

Meanwhile, a nested equilibrium sequence modeling\nprocedure is devised for efficient closed-loop planning that incorporates\nuseful feedback from the environment (or an internal world model). Our method\nis evaluated on the VirtualHome-Env benchmark, showing advanced performance\nwith improved scaling w.r.t. inference-time computation.

Grounded in the competence-based theory of trust, this\nwork formalizes I-trustworthy framework -- a novel framework for assessing the\ntrustworthiness of probabilistic classifiers for inference tasks by linking\nlocal calibration to trustworthiness. To assess I-trustworthiness, we use the\nlocal calibration error (LCE) and develop a method of hypothesis-testing. This\nmethod utilizes a kernel-based test statistic, Kernel Local Calibration Error\n(KLCE), to test local calibration of a probabilistic classifier. This study\nprovides theoretical guarantees by offering convergence bounds for an unbiased\nestimator of KLCE. Additionally, we present a diagnostic tool designed to\nidentify and measure biases in cases of miscalibration. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application to both\nsimulated and real-world datasets. Finally, LCE of related recalibration\nmethods is studied, and we provide evidence of insufficiency of existing\nmethods to achieve I-trustworthiness."}

Policy steering offers an elegant solution\nto reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from\nlow-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might\nhope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its\nopen-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to\nunderstand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented\nfundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In\nresponse, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of\nVLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is\nto decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from\nevaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to\nimagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For\nforethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason\nabout the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural\nlanguage--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework\nacross diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge\nrepresentational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

To address these\nlimitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual\ninformation to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations.\nBuilding on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into\nBC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured\nframework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant\nfeatures.

These measurements, critical for infrastructure health\nmonitoring, often require expensive instrumentation. The high financial risk\nassociated with sensor damage or vessel loss creates a reluctance to deploy\nuncrewed surface vessels (USVs) for bathymetry. However, the crewed-boat\nbathymetry operations, are costly, pose hazards to personnel, and frequently\nfail to achieve the stable conditions necessary for bathymetry data collection,\nespecially under high currents. Further research is essential to advance\nautonomous control, navigation, and data processing technologies, with a\nparticular focus on bathymetry. There is a notable lack of accessible hardware\nplatforms that allow for integrated research in both bathymetry-focused\nautonomous control and navigation, as well as data evaluation and processing.\nThis paper addresses this gap through the design and implementation of two\ncomplementary USV systems tailored for uncrewed bathymetry research.

The NAC-USV facilitates the investigation of autonomous,\nfail-safe navigation and control, emphasizing the stability requirements for\nhigh-quality bathymetry data collection while minimizing the risk to equipment.\nThe BEP-USV, which mirrors the NAC-USV hardware, is then used for additional\ncontrol validation and in-depth exploration of bathymetry data evaluation and\npost-processing methodologies.
