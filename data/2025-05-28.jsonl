To\nalleviate the latency of auto-regressive decoding, some studies explore the\nsingle (first) token decoding for ranking approximation, but they suffer from\nsevere degradation in tail positions. Although speculative decoding (SD)\nmethods can be a remedy with verification at different positions, they face\nchallenges in ranking systems due to their left-to-right decoding paradigm.\nFirstly, ranking systems require strict latency constraints, but verification\nrounds in SD methods remain agnostic; Secondly, SD methods usually discard\nlistwise ranking knowledge about unaccepted items in previous rounds, hindering\nfuture multi-token prediction, especially when candidate tokens are the\nunaccepted items. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Speculative\nDecoding method for fast ranking inference of LLMs. To meet the ranking\nsystems' latency requirement, we propose an up-to-down decoding paradigm that\nemploys an agent to iteratively modify the ranking sequence under a constrained\nbudget. Specifically, we design a ranking-tailored policy optimization,\nactively exploring optimal multi-round ranking modification policy verified by\nLLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To better approximate the target LLM\nunder the constrained budget, we trigger the agent fully utilizing the listwise\nranking knowledge about all items verified by LLMs across different rounds in\nRL, enhancing the modification policy of the agent. More importantly, we\ndemonstrate the theoretical robustness and advantages of our paradigm and\nimplementation. Experiments on both IR and RS tasks show the effectiveness of\nour proposed method."}

By\napplying powerful generative models such as flow-based models to reinforcement\nlearning, we can effectively model complex multi-modal action distributions and\nachieve superior robotic control in continuous action spaces, surpassing the\nlimitations of single-modal action distributions with traditional\nGaussian-based policies. Previous methods usually adopt the generative models\nas behavior models to fit state-conditioned action distributions from datasets,\nwith policy optimization conducted separately through additional policies using\nvalue-based sample weighting or gradient-based updates. However, this\nseparation prevents the simultaneous optimization of multi-modal distribution\nfitting and policy improvement, ultimately hindering the training of models and\ndegrading the performance. To address this issue, we propose Decision Flow, a\nunified framework that integrates multi-modal action distribution modeling and\npolicy optimization. Specifically, our method formulates the action generation\nprocedure of flow-based models as a flow decision-making process, where each\naction generation step corresponds to one flow decision. Consequently, our\nmethod seamlessly optimizes the flow policy while capturing multi-modal action\ndistributions.

These \"hidden\ngifts\" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others\nare hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a\nvery simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have\nindividual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if\nall the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.\nHowever, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective\nreward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they\nuse it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents\nhave dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a \"hidden\ngift\". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including\nMARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this\nsimple task.

In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture\nthat combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF)\nclassifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike\nprior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method\nintroduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final\nconvolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF\nclassifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration\nstrain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a\nrelative improvement of 21\\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10\nevents per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals\n(SNR $\\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy\nenvironments.

These factors lead to\nconflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment.

To enhance learning efficiency\nand solution quality, we develop an MSA-guided deep Q-learning algorithm that\nintegrates the iterative structure of traditional traffic assignment methods\ninto the RL training process. The proposed approach is evaluated on both the\nBraess and Ortuzar-Willumsen (OW) networks. Results show that the RL agent\nconverges to the theoretical SO solution in the Braess network and achieves\nonly a 0.35% deviation in the OW network. Further ablation studies demonstrate\nthat the route action set's design significantly impacts convergence speed and\nfinal performance, with SO-informed route sets leading to faster learning and\nbetter outcomes. This work provides a theoretically grounded and practically\nrelevant approach to bridging individual routing behavior with system-level\nefficiency through learning-based sequential assignment."}

These agents interact with\nenvironment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces\nand interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However,\nmismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent\nregarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions\nin the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \\textbf{agent-environment\nmisalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent\nstrategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still\nremains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that\nagent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent\nperformance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \\textbf{ALIGN}, an\n\\underline{A}uto-A\\underline{l}igned \\underline{I}nterface\n\\underline{G}e\\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment\nby enriching the interface.

Our intuition is that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due\nto gradual recurrent updates, and dense recurrence operations block the\ndelivery of past information. In particular, we observe that upper layers of\nSSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode global information, while lower\nlayers encode local information. Motivated by this, we introduce Simba, a\nhierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token pruning. Simba\nsparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the upper layers to\nbehave like highways.

In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for\na specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient\ncontextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.\nHowever, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of\nselecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant\nschema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM\nunderstand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the\ngo-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods\nintroduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.\n  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision,\nhigh-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL\ngeneration, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches.

Traditional machine learning approaches\noften require large, labeled datasets and extensive fine-tuning, yet remain\nopaque and difficult for domain experts to interpret or improve. In this paper,\nwe propose a transparent and data-efficient investment decision framework\npowered by memory-augmented large language models (LLMs) using in-context\nlearning (ICL). Central to our method is a natural language policy embedded\ndirectly into the LLM prompt, enabling the model to apply explicit reasoning\npatterns and allowing human experts to easily interpret, audit, and iteratively\nrefine the logic. We introduce a lightweight training process that combines\nfew-shot learning with an in-context learning loop, enabling the LLM to update\nits decision policy iteratively based on structured feedback. With only minimal\nsupervision and no gradient-based optimization, our system predicts startup\nsuccess far more accurately than existing benchmarks. It is over 20x more\nprecise than random chance, which succeeds 1.9% of the time. It is also 7.1x\nmore precise than the typical 5.6% success rate of top-tier venture capital\n(VC) firms."}

We\nnote that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key\narchitectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during\npretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted\nsegmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones.

On propagating this bound onward, we obtain\nsignificantly improved rates for $\\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap\nomniprediction for a loss class of convex Lipschitz functions. In particular,\nwe show that our algorithm achieves $O(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ $\\ell_{1}$-swap\nmulticalibration and swap omniprediction errors, thereby improving upon the\nprevious best-known bound of $O(T^{\\frac{7}{8}})$. As a consequence of our\nimproved online results, we further obtain several improved sample complexity\nrates in the distributional setting. In particular, we establish a\n$O(\\varepsilon ^ {-3})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an\n$\\varepsilon$-swap omnipredictor for the class of convex and Lipschitz\nfunctions, $O(\\varepsilon ^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning\nan $\\varepsilon$-swap agnostic learner for the squared loss, and $O(\\varepsilon\n^ {-5}), O(\\varepsilon ^ {-2.5})$ sample complexities of learning $\\ell_{1},\n\\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibrated predictors against linear functions, all of\nwhich significantly improve on the previous best-known bounds."}

While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely\non a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique\ncharacteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and\ninterpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a\nmulti-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and\nimages. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one\ntext-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user\nquery into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each\nmodality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through\ncross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive\nanswer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning\nprocess transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of\nexpertise.

To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet\neffective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or\narchitectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by\nprocessing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (a\nfork phase), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in\nthe remaining layers (a merge phase).

The use of masks provides direct control over the\nediting process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper,\nwe present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests.\nThe key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked\nregions of image templates while preserving the original content in the\nunmasked areas. Driven by this insight, InstGenIE judiciously skips redundant\ncomputations associated with the unmasked areas by reusing cached intermediate\nactivations from previous inferences. To mitigate the high cache loading\noverhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps\ncomputation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in\nonline serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel\ncontinuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly\narrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising\ncomputation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous\nmasks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing\nstrategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache\nloading. Collectively, InstGenIE outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion serving\nsystems for image editing, achieving up to 3x higher throughput and reducing\naverage request latency by up to 14.7x while ensuring image quality."}

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted\nTraffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which\nintegrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised\ninstruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between\ntextual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust\nclassification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and\nzero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant\nimprovements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62%) and 92.11%(4.19%),\nAPP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17%) and 72.13%(15.15%), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.)\nto 95.03%(9.16%) and 81.95%(12.08%). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic\ndataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to\nvalidate ETooL's effectiveness under varying distributional conditions.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL's\ninstruction tuning approach."}

In this work, we build upon recent ideas that rely on\nrecasting the CP problem as a statistical learning problem, directly targeting\ncoverage and adaptivity. This statistical learning problem is based on\nreproducible kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and kernel sum-of-squares (SoS)\nmethods. First, we extend previous results with a general representer theorem\nand exhibit the dual formulation of the learning problem.

Second, we introduce a new\nhyperparameter tuning strategy tailored specifically to target adaptivity\nthrough bounds on test-conditional coverage.

Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses\nthese pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for\nVLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In\nthis work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference\noptimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and\nmasks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region\nbetween the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally\nmore complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending\norder of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining\nvisual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise\npreference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object\nmasking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and\nObject HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization\nmethods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance.

While CFG enhances visual quality and improves\nalignment with prompts, it often reduces sample diversity, leading to a\nchallenging trade-off between quality and diversity. To address this issue, we\nmake two key contributions. First, CFG generally does not correspond to a\nwell-defined denoising diffusion model (DDM). In particular, contrary to common\nintuition, CFG does not yield samples from the target distribution associated\nwith the limiting CFG score as the noise level approaches zero -- where the\ndata distribution is tilted by a power $w \\gt 1$ of the conditional\ndistribution. We identify the missing component: a R\\'enyi divergence term that\nacts as a repulsive force and is required to correct CFG and render it\nconsistent with a proper DDM. Our analysis shows that this correction term\nvanishes in the low-noise limit. Second, motivated by this insight, we propose\na Gibbs-like sampling procedure to draw samples from the desired tilted\ndistribution. This method starts with an initial sample from the conditional\ndiffusion model without CFG and iteratively refines it, preserving diversity\nwhile progressively enhancing sample quality.

The core idea is that, instead of\ngenerating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames\nand model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division\nfaces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise\nlevels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of\noriginal parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle\nthis. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with\nprogressively decreasing noise levels.

Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without\naccess to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and\nease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically\nproduce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning\nstyles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization,\nwhich aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying\nmodel parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on\nresponse-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without\nmodeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM,\na framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's\nreasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs\nstatistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping\nresponse-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized\nreasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the\ninference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via\nfeature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured\nfactors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow\nuser-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization\nenhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model\noutputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms\nresponse-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nreasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs."}

However, this capability is\nlimited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the\ninvisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To\novercome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision\n(SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal\nstructure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible\ninternal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical,\nappearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe\nconstraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima\nowing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching\nfor global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive\nexperiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity\nshapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties\nof SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF."}

To bridge these gaps, we present\nAgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed\nfor agricultural crop mapping.

A $K$-MIM is a function $f:\\mathbb{R}^d\\to\n\\mathbb{R}$ that depends only on the projection of its input onto a\n$K$-dimensional subspace. We give a general algorithm for PAC learning a broad\nclass of MIMs with respect to the square loss, even in the presence of\nadversarial label noise. Moreover, we establish a nearly matching Statistical\nQuery (SQ) lower bound, providing evidence that the complexity of our algorithm\nis qualitatively optimal as a function of the dimension. Specifically, we\nconsider the class of bounded variation MIMs with the property that degree at\nmost $m$ distinguishing moments exist with respect to projections onto any\nsubspace. In the presence of adversarial label noise, the complexity of our\nlearning algorithm is $d^{O(m)}2^{\\mathrm{poly}(K/\\epsilon)}$. For the\nrealizable and independent noise settings, our algorithm incurs complexity\n$d^{O(m)}2^{\\mathrm{poly}(K)}(1/\\epsilon)^{O(K)}$. To complement our upper\nbound, we show that if for some subspace degree-$m$ distinguishing moments do\nnot exist, then any SQ learner for the corresponding class of MIMs requires\ncomplexity $d^{\\Omega(m)}$. As an application, we give the first efficient\nlearner for the class of positive-homogeneous $L$-Lipschitz $K$-MIMs. The\nresulting algorithm has complexity $\\mathrm{poly}(d)\n2^{\\mathrm{poly}(KL/\\epsilon)}$. This gives a new PAC learning algorithm for\nLipschitz homogeneous ReLU networks with complexity independent of the network\nsize, removing the exponential dependence incurred in prior work."}

We propose a new formalism to avoid this\ndilemma altogether by minimizing a risk functional which explicitly balances\nthe performance of the recommended arm and the cost incurred by learning this\narm. In this framework, a cost is incurred for each observation during the\nsampling phase, and upon recommending an arm, a performance penalty is incurred\nfor identifying a suboptimal arm.

This new regime mirrors the priorities of many\npractitioners, e.g. maximizing profit in an A/B testing framework, better than\nclassical fixed budget or confidence settings.

Upon\nencountering a reasoning problem, the model immediately forms a preliminary\nguess about the answer, which we term as an internal bias since it is not\nderived through actual reasoning. When this guess conflicts with its reasoning\nresult, the model tends to engage in reflection, leading to the waste of\ncomputational resources. Through further interpretability experiments, we find\nthat this behavior is largely driven by the model's excessive attention to the\ninput section, which amplifies the influence of internal bias on its\ndecision-making process.

Using this foundation, we systematically\nreview the field through three key lenses: the motivation for studying LLM\nknowledge boundaries, methods for identifying these boundaries, and strategies\nfor mitigating the challenges they present. Finally, we discuss open challenges\nand potential research directions in this area. We aim for this survey to offer\nthe community a comprehensive overview, facilitate access to key issues, and\ninspire further advancements in LLM knowledge research."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical\nand holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both\ngeneral video and online streaming video comprehension.

Utilizing symbolic graphics\nprograms, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic\nreasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs\nprocedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in\ngeneral program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new\nlayer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic\nquestions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To\nsemantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the\nability to \"imagine\" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would\nlook with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We\nuse this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic\nvisual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with\nminimal human effort.

At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --\nmirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the\nreverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok\nfundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key\nways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion\nand AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok\ntokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture\n-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training\nobjectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman\nequation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports\nreinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable\nto that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA\ntokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality\nreconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for\nboth visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any\ntext-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual\ntokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all\nthe existing models by a large margin.

However, we observe that static\nthresholds do not give formal correctness guarantees, can result in unexpected\nerror rates, and lead to suboptimal cache hit rates. This paper proposes\nvCache, the first verified semantic cache with user-defined error rate\nguarantees. It employs an online learning algorithm to estimate an optimal\nthreshold for each cached prompt, enabling reliable cache responses without\nadditional training. Our experiments show that vCache consistently meets the\nspecified error bounds while outperforming state-of-the-art static-threshold\nand fine-tuned embedding baselines. We release the vCache implementation and\nbenchmarks to support future research."}

The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables\nflexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to\nvarious downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a\ncritical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards\nfavoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion\ncomplexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we\npropose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for\ncomprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion,\nextensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V\nattains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly\nrevealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range,\ncontrollability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in\ncomparison to existing methods."}

However, existing\nevaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint,\noverlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For\ninstance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event,\nsuch as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia.\nEffective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article\nwhile preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.\nDUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in\ndifferent styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and\nother content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for\nunlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving\nshared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning\nmethods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent\nunlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove\nsurface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge\nwithout damaging shared content.

We start by highlighting\nthe popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't\nquite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions\ninclude (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with\nstates becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs\nand (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the\ntrajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these\nsimplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an\noutcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including\nGSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised\nfine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves\nperformance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the\nstructural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer\nsequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of \"RL\ngenerating longer thinking traces.\" While RL may well be a very useful\ntechnique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows\nthat the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP\nrender the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable."}

Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric\nchanges, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for\nlong-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via\nInterpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block\nthat embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation.

Many state-of-the-art verification algorithms use reachability\nanalysis or abstract interpretation to enclose the set of possible outputs of a\nneural network. Often, the verification is inconclusive due to the conservatism\nof the enclosure. To address this problem, we design a novel latent space for\nformal verification that enables the transfer of output specifications to the\ninput space for an iterative specification-driven input refinement, i.e., we\niteratively reduce the set of possible inputs to only enclose the unsafe ones.\nThe latent space is constructed from a novel view of projection-based set\nrepresentations, e.g., zonotopes, which are commonly used in reachability\nanalysis of neural networks. A projection-based set representation is a\n\"shadow\" of a higher-dimensional set -- a latent space -- that does not change\nduring a set propagation through a neural network.

PEMC can also be viewed as a \"modernized\" view of\ncontrol variates, where we consider the overall computation-cost-aware variance\nreduction instead of per-replication reduction, while bypassing the closed-form\nmean function requirement and maintaining the advantageous unbiasedness and\nuncertainty quantifiability of Monte Carlo.\n  We illustrate PEMC's broader efficacy and versatility through three examples:\nfirst, equity derivatives such as variance swaps under stochastic local\nvolatility models; second, interest rate derivatives such as swaption pricing\nunder the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) interest-rate model. Finally, we showcase\nPEMC in a socially significant context - ambulance dispatch and hospital load\nbalancing - where accurate mortality rate estimates are key for ethically\nsensitive decision-making. Across these diverse scenarios, PEMC consistently\nreduces variance while preserving unbiasedness, highlighting its potential as a\npowerful enhancement to standard Monte Carlo baselines."}

However, a critical but often\noverlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples\ngenerated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically\ndiscarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may\ncontain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability\ndistribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we\nsystematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in\ntraining neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and\nnumerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate\nperformance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our\nanalysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field\ntheory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV\nconstruction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use\nof MCMC data in training neural networks."}

Minor editing issue fixed. Code and dataset\n  are available at https://thekinsley.github.io/PosterO/", "summary": "In poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for\nautomatically arranging visual-textual elements on the given image. With\nlimited training data, existing work focused on image-centric enhancement.\nHowever, this neglects the diversity of layouts and fails to cope with\nshape-variant elements or diverse design intents in generalized settings. To\nthis end, we proposed a layout-centric approach that leverages layout knowledge\nimplicit in large language models (LLMs) to create posters for omnifarious\npurposes, hence the name PosterO. Specifically, it structures layouts from\ndatasets as trees in SVG language by universal shape, design intent\nvectorization, and hierarchical node representation. Then, it applies LLMs\nduring inference to predict new layout trees by in-context learning with\nintent-aligned example selection. After layout trees are generated, we can\nseamlessly realize them into poster designs by editing the chat with LLMs.\nExtensive experimental results have demonstrated that PosterO can generate\nvisually appealing layouts for given images, achieving new state-of-the-art\nperformance across various benchmarks. To further explore PosterO's abilities\nunder the generalized settings, we built PStylish7, the first dataset with\nmulti-purpose posters and various-shaped elements, further offering a\nchallenging test for advanced research."}

This study\nevaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health\nEvaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor\nand machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and\nself-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117),\nparticipants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of\ninterventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress\nlogging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, \"Moments of\nStress\" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and\nanalyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly,\nsecondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized\nAnxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire\n(PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also\nanalyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a\nsubstantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control\ngroup, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective\nscores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the\ntreatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS\nscores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth\ntools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for\nextended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like\ndepression."}

In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (EU) -- due to incomplete\nknowledge -- requires richer representations than those offered by classical\nprobability. Imprecise probability (IP) theory offers such models, capturing\nambiguity and partial belief. This has driven growing interest in imprecise\nprobabilistic machine learning (IPML), where inference and decision-making rely\non broader uncertainty models -- highlighting the need for metrics beyond\nclassical probability. This work introduces the Integral Imprecise Probability\nMetric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical\nIntegral Probability Metric (IPM) to the setting of capacities -- a broad class\nof IP models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities,\nprobability intervals, belief functions, and more. Theoretically, we establish\nconditions under which IIPM serves as a valid metric and metrises a form of\nweak convergence of capacities. Practically, IIPM not only enables comparison\nacross different IP models but also supports the quantification of epistemic\nuncertainty within a single IP model. In particular, by comparing an IP model\nwith its conjugate, IIPM gives rise to a new class of EU measures -- Maximum\nMean Imprecision -- which satisfy key axiomatic properties proposed in the\nUncertainty Quantification literature. We validate MMI through selective\nclassification experiments, demonstrating strong empirical performance against\nestablished EU measures, and outperforming them when classical methods struggle\nto scale to a large number of classes. Our work advances both theory and\npractice in IPML, offering a principled framework for comparing and quantifying\nepistemic uncertainty under imprecision."}

Noise", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "We study the linear stochastic bandit problem, relaxing the standard i.i.d.\nassumption on the observation noise. As an alternative to this restrictive\nassumption, we allow the noise terms across rounds to be sub-Gaussian but\ninterdependent, with dependencies that decay over time. To address this\nsetting, we develop new confidence sequences using a recently introduced\nreduction scheme to sequential probability assignment, and use these to derive\na bandit algorithm based on the principle of optimism in the face of\nuncertainty. We provide regret bounds for the resulting algorithm, expressed in\nterms of the decay rate of the strength of dependence between observations.\nAmong other results, we show that our bounds recover the standard rates up to a\nfactor of the mixing time for geometrically mixing observation noise."}
